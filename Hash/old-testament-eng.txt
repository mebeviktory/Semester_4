The

OLD Testament

The First Book of Moses
Called

Genesis
Chapter 1
God creates this earth and its heaven
and all forms of life in six days—The
creative acts of each day are described—
God creates man, both male and female,
in His own image—Man is given dominion over all things and is commanded
to multiply and fill the earth.
n the a beginning b God c created
the d heaven and the e earth.
2 And the earth was without
a 
form, and void; and b darkness was
upon the face of the deep. And the
c 
Spirit of God d moved upon the face
of the waters.
3 And God a said, Let there be b light:
and there was light.
4 And God saw the light, that it
was a good: and God divided the
light from the darkness.
5 And God called the light a Day,
and the b darkness he called Night.
And the evening and the morning
were the c first d day.
6 ¶ And God said, Let there be
a a firmament in the midst of the
waters, and let it divide the waters
from the waters.
7 And God made the firmament,

8 And God called the firmament

Heaven. And the evening and the
morning were the second b day.

under the heaven be gathered together unto b one place, and let the

of the waters called he Seas: and
God saw that it was good.

fruit after his kind, whose seed is in

for c seasons, and for days, and years:
15 And let them be for lights in
the firmament of the heaven to give
light upon the earth: and it was so.
16 And God made two great lights;
the a greater light to rule the day,
and the lesser light to rule the night:
he made the b stars also.
17 And God set them in the a firmament of the heaven to give light

Be fruitful, and a multiply, and fill

multiply in the earth.

25 And God made the beast of the
earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that
creepeth upon the earth after his

26 ¶ And God said, Let a us b make

The Creation is completed—God rests
on the seventh day—The prior spirit
creation is explained—Adam and Eve
are placed in the Garden of Eden—
They are forbidden to eat of the tree
of knowledge of good and evil—Adam
names every living creature—Adam and
Eve are married by the Lord.
Thus the heavens and the a earth
were finished, and all the b host of
them.
2 And on the seventh day God
ended his work which he had a made;
and he b rested on the seventh day

for Adam there was not found an

21 And the Lord God caused a
deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and
he slept: and he took one of his
ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;
22 And the rib, which the Lord
God had taken from man, made he
a a woman, and brought her unto
the man.

said unto the woman, c Yea, hath
God said, Ye shall not eat of every
tree of the garden?
2 And the woman said unto the
serpent, We may eat of the fruit of
the trees of the garden:
3 But of the fruit of the a tree which
is in the midst of the garden, God
hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
4 And the serpent said unto the
woman, a Ye shall not surely die:

day ye eat thereof, then your a eyes
shall be opened, and ye shall be as
gods, b knowing good and c evil.
6 And when the woman saw that
the tree was good for a food, and that
it was b pleasant to the eyes, and a
tree c to be desired to make one wise,
she took of the d fruit thereof, and
did e eat, and gave also unto her
husband with her; and he did f eat.
7 And the eyes of them both were
a 
opened, and they knew that they
were b naked; and they sewed fig
leaves together, and made themselves c aprons.

Eve bears Cain and Abel—They offer sacrifices—Cain slays Abel and
is cursed by the Lord, who also sets a
mark upon him—The children of men
multiply—Adam begets Seth, and Seth
begets Enos.
And Adam knew Eve his wife; and
she conceived, and bare a Cain, and
said, I have gotten a man from the
Lord.
2 And she again bare his brother
Abel. And Abel was a a keeper of
sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the
ground.
3 And in process of time it came
to pass, that Cain brought of the
fruit of the ground an offering unto
the Lord.
4 And Abel, he also brought of the
a 
firstlings of his flock and of the fat
thereof. And the Lord had respect
unto b Abel and to his c offering:
5 But unto a Cain and to his b offering he had not c respect. And Cain
was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
6 And the Lord said unto Cain,
Why art thou wroth? and why is
thy countenance fallen?

8 And Cain talked with Abel his
brother: and it came to pass, when
they were in the field, that Cain
rose up against Abel his brother,
and a slew him.
9 ¶ And the Lord said unto Cain,
Where is Abel thy brother? And he
said, I know not: Am I my a brother’s b keeper?
10 And he said, What hast thou
done? the voice of thy brother’s
a 
blood crieth unto me from the
ground.
11 And now art thou a cursed from
the b earth, which hath opened her
mouth to receive thy brother’s blood
from thy hand;
12 When thou tillest the ground,
it shall not henceforth yield unto
thee her strength; a a fugitive and a
vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
13 And Cain said unto the Lord,
a 
My punishment is greater than I
can bear.
14 Behold, thou hast driven me
out this day from the face of the
earth; and from thy face shall I be
hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a
vagabond in the earth; and it shall
come to pass, that every one that
findeth me shall a slay me.
15 And the Lord said unto him,
Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,
vengeance shall be taken on him
sevenfold. And the Lord set a a mark
upon Cain, lest any finding him
should kill him.

20 Fifteen cubits upward did the
waters prevail; and the mountains
were covered.
21 And all flesh died that moved
upon the earth, both of fowl, and
of cattle, and of beast, and of every
creeping thing that creepeth upon
the earth, and a every man:
22 All in whose nostrils was the
a 
breath of life, of all that was in
the dry land, died.
23 And every living substance was
a 
destroyed which was upon the face
of the ground, both man, and cattle,
and the creeping things, and the
fowl of the heaven; and they were
destroyed from the earth: and b Noah
only remained c alive, and they that
were with him in the ark.
24 And the waters prevailed upon
the earth an hundred and fifty days.
Chapter 8
The Flood ceases—Noah sends forth a
dove, which returns with an olive leaf—
He releases all living things from the
ark—He offers sacrifices—Seedtime,
harvest, and seasons are ensured.

12

And God remembered a Noah, and
every living thing, and all the cattle
that was with him in the ark: and
God made a wind to pass over the
earth, and the waters b assuaged;
2 The a fountains also of the deep
and the windows of heaven were
stopped, and the rain from heaven
was restrained;
3 And the waters a returned from
off the earth continually: and after
the end of the hundred and fifty
days the b waters c were abated.
4 And the ark rested in the seventh
month, on the seventeenth day of
the month, upon the mountains
of Ararat.
5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in
the tenth month, on the first day
of the month, were the tops of the
mountains seen.
6 ¶ And it came to pass at the end of
forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:
7 And he sent forth a raven, which
went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.
8 Also he sent forth a dove from
him, to see if the waters were abated
from off the face of the ground;
9 But the dove found no rest for
the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for
the waters were on the face of the
whole earth: then he put forth his
hand, and took her, and pulled her
in unto him into the ark.
10 And he a stayed yet other seven
days; and again he sent forth the
dove out of the ark;
11 And the dove came in to him in
the evening; and, lo, in her mouth
was an olive leaf plucked off: so
Noah knew that the waters were
abated from off the earth.

13 ¶ And it came to pass in the a six
hundredth and first year, in the first
month, the first day of the month, the
waters were dried up from off the
earth: and Noah removed the cover­
ing of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
14 And in the second month, on
the seven and twentieth day of the
month, was the earth dried.
15 ¶ And God spake unto Noah,
saying,
16 Go forth of the ark, thou, and
thy a wife, and thy sons, and thy
sons’ wives with thee.
17 Bring forth with thee every living
thing that is with thee, of all flesh,
both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon
the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be a fruitful,
and b multiply upon the earth.
18 And Noah went forth, and his
sons, and his wife, and his sons’
wives with him:
19 Every beast, every creeping
thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever
creepeth upon the earth, after their
a 
kinds, went forth out of the ark.
20 ¶ a And Noah builded an altar
unto the Lord; and took of every
b 
clean beast, and of every clean
fowl, and offered burnt c offerings
on the altar.
21 And the Lord smelled a sweet
a 
savour; and the Lord said in his
heart, I will not again b curse the
ground any more c for man’s sake;
for the d imagination of man’s heart
is e evil from his youth; neither will
I again f smite any more every thing
living, as I have done.

Noah and his sons are commanded

life—The death penalty is decreed for
murder—God will not again destroy the
earth by a flood—Canaan is cursed;
Shem and Japheth are blessed.
And God blessed Noah and his sons,

18 ¶ And the a sons of Noah, that
went forth of the ark, were Shem,

the father of Canaan.
19 These are the three sons of Noah:
and of them was the whole a earth
overspread.
20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:
21 And he drank of the wine, and
was drunken; and he was uncovered
within his tent.
22 And Ham, the father of Canaan,
saw the nakedness of his father,
and told his two brethren without.
23 And Shem and Japheth took
a garment, and laid it upon both
their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness
of their father; and their faces were
backward, and they saw not their
father’s nakedness.
24 And Noah awoke from his wine,
and knew what his younger son had
done unto him.
25 And he said, a Cursed be b Canaan; a servant of servants shall
he be unto his brethren.

Chapter 10
The descendants of Noah are Japheth,
whose descendants are Gentiles; Ham,
whose descendants include the Canaanites; and Shem, of whom came
Peleg (in whose days the earth was
divided).
Now these are the a generations of
the b sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and
Japheth: and unto them were sons
born after the flood.
2 The sons of Japheth; a Gomer, and
b

Tubal, and c Meshech, and Tiras.
3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and a Togarmah.

and Sabtecha: and the sons of

8 And Cush begat a Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
9 He was a mighty hunter before
the Lord: wherefore it is said, Even

10 And the beginning of his kingdom was a Babel, and Erech, and
Accad, and Calneh, in the land of
b 
Shinar.
11 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the
city Rehoboth, and Calah,
12 And Resen between Nineveh
and Calah: the same is a great city.
13 And a Mizraim begat Ludim,
and Anamim, and Lehabim, and
Naphtuhim,
14 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim,
(out of whom came a Philistim,) and
Caphtorim.
15 ¶ And a Canaan begat Sidon his
firstborn, and Heth,
16 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,
17 And the Hivite, and the Arkite,
and the Sinite,
18 And the Arvadite, and the
Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and
afterward were the families of the
a 
Canaanites spread abroad.
19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest
to a Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest,
unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and
Admah, and Zeboim, even unto
Lasha.
20 These are the sons of Ham, after
their families, after their tongues, in
their countries, and in their nations.
21 ¶ Unto Shem also, the father
of all the children of a Eber, the
brother of Japheth the elder, even
to him were children born.
22 The children of a Shem; Elam,
and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and
Lud, and Aram.
23 And the children of Aram; a Uz,
and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and
Salah begat Eber.
25 And unto Eber were born two
sons: the name of one was a Peleg;

for in his days was the earth b divided; and his brother’s name was

26 And Joktan begat Almodad,
and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth,
and Jerah,
27 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and
Diklah,
28 And Obal, and Abimael, and
Sheba,
29 And Ophir, and a Havilah, and
Jobab: all these were the sons of
Joktan.
30 And their dwelling was from
Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar
a mount of the east.
31 These are the sons of Shem, after
their families, after their tongues,
in their lands, after their nations.
32 These are the families of the sons
of Noah, after their generations, in
their a nations: and b by these were
the c nations divided in the earth
after the flood.
Chapter 11
All men speak the same language—They
build the Tower of Babel—The Lord
confounds their language and scatters
them over all the earth—The generations of Shem include Abram, whose
wife is Sarai—Abram leaves Ur and
settles in Haran.
And the whole earth was of one
a 
language, and of one speech.
2 And it came to pass, as they
journeyed from the east, that they
found a plain in the land of a Shinar; and they dwelt there.
3 And they said one to another,
Go to, let us make brick, and burn
them throughly. And they had brick
for stone, and a slime had they for
mortar.
4 And they said, Go to, let us build
us a city and a tower, whose top may

5 And the Lord came down to see
the city and the tower, which the
children of men builded.
6 And the Lord said, Behold, the
people is one, and they have all one
language; and this they begin to do:
and now nothing will be restrained
from them, which they have imagined to do.
7 Go to, let us go down, and there
confound their a language, that they
may not understand one another’s
speech.
8 So the Lord scattered them
abroad from thence upon the face
of all the earth: and they left off to
build the acity.
9 Therefore is the name of it called
Babel; because the Lord did there
a 
confound the b language of all the
earth: and from thence did the Lord
c 
scatter them d abroad upon the face

10 ¶ These are the generations of
Shem: Shem was an hundred years
old, and begat Arphaxad two years
after the flood:
11 And Shem lived after he begat
Arphaxad five hundred years, and
begat sons and daughters.
12 And Arphaxad lived five and
thirty years, and begat Salah:
13 And Arphaxad lived after he
begat Salah four hundred and three

14 And Salah lived thirty years,
and begat Eber:
15 And Salah lived after he begat
Eber four hundred and three years,

and begat Reu:
19 And Peleg lived after he begat
Reu two hundred and nine years,
and begat sons and daughters.
20 And Reu lived two and thirty
years, and begat Serug:
21 And Reu lived after he begat
Serug two hundred and seven years,
and begat sons and daughters.
22 And Serug lived thirty years,
and begat Nahor:
23 And Serug lived after he begat
Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
24 And Nahor lived nine and
twenty years, and begat a Terah:
25 And Nahor lived after he begat
Terah an hundred and nineteen
years, and begat sons and daughters.
26 And a Terah lived seventy years,
and begat b Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
27 ¶ Now these are the generations
of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat
Lot.
28 And Haran died before his
father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the a Chaldees.
29 And Abram and Nahor took
them wives: the name of Abram’s
wife was a Sarai; and the name of
Nahor’s wife, b Milcah, the daughter
of Haran, the father of Milcah, and
the father of Iscah.
30 But Sarai was a barren; she had
no child.
31 And Terah took Abram his son,
and Lot the son of Haran his son’s
son, and Sarai his daughter in law,
his son Abram’s wife; and they went

32 And the days of Terah were two
hundred and five years: and Terah
died in Haran.

Chapter 12
Abram will become a great nation—
He and his seed will bless all the
families of the earth—He travels from
Haran to the land of Canaan—Because of famine, he goes down into
Egypt—Abram and Sarai are tested in
Pharaoh’s court.
Now the Lord had a  said unto
b 
Abram, c Get thee out of thy d country, and from thy e kindred, and from
thy f father’s house, unto a g land that
I will shew thee:
2 And I will make of thee a a great

shalt be a blessing:

thee, and b curse him that c curseth
thee: and in thee shall all d families
of the earth be e blessed.

had spoken unto him; and Lot went
with him: and Abram was a seventy

and they will kill me, but they will
save thee alive.
13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my
a 
sister: that it may be well with me
for thy sake; and my soul shall live
because of thee.
14 ¶ And it came to pass, that,
when Abram was come into Egypt,
the Egyptians a beheld the woman
that she was very fair.
15 The princes also of Pharaoh
saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was
taken into Pharaoh’s house.
16 And he entreated Abram well
for her sake: and he had sheep,
and oxen, and he asses, and men­
servants, and maidservants, and
she asses, and camels.
17 And the Lord a plagued Pharaoh
and his house with great b plagues
because of Sarai Abram’s wife.
18 And Pharaoh called Abram,
and said, What is this that thou hast
a 
done unto me? why didst thou not
tell me that she was thy wife?
19 Why saidst thou, She is my a sister? so I might have taken her to
me to wife: now therefore behold
thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20 And Pharaoh commanded his
men concerning him: and they
sent him away, and his wife, and
all that he had.
Chapter 13
Abram returns from Egypt—He and

And Abram went up out of Egypt,

and Lot with him, into the south.
2 And Abram was very a rich in

the place where his tent had been
at the beginning, between Beth-el
and b Hai;
4 Unto the place of the a altar,
which he had made there at the
first: and there Abram b called on the
name of the Lord.
5 ¶ And Lot also, which went with
Abram, had flocks, and herds, and
tents.
6 And the land was not able to
bear them, that they might dwell
together: for their substance was
great, so that they could not dwell
together.
7 And there was a strife between
the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and
the herdmen of Lot’s cattle: and the
a 
Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled
then in the land.
8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let
there be no a strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between
my herdmen and thy herdmen; for
we be b brethren.
9 Is not the whole land before thee?
separate thyself, I pray thee, from
me: if thou wilt take the left hand,
then I will go to the right; or if thou
depart to the right hand, then I will
go to the left.
10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and
beheld all the plain of Jordan, that
it was well watered every where,
before the Lord destroyed a Sodom
and Gomorrah, even as the garden
of the Lord, like the land of Egypt,

11 Then Lot chose him all the plain

one from the other.

tent toward Sodom.
13 But the men of a Sodom were
b 
wicked and sinners before the
Lord exceedingly.
14 ¶ And the Lord said unto
Abram, after that Lot was separated
from him, Lift up now thine eyes,
and look from the place where thou
art northward, and southward, and
eastward, and a westward:
15 For all the a land which thou
seest, to thee will I give it, and to
thy seed for ever.
16 And I will make thy a seed as the

can number the dust of the earth,
then shall thy seed also be numbered.
17 Arise, walk through the land in
the length of it and in the breadth
of it; for I will give it unto thee.
18 Then Abram removed his tent,
and came and dwelt a in the plain
of Mamre, which is in b Hebron, and
built there an c altar unto the Lord.

shall I a know that I shall inherit it?

six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.
Chapter 17
Abram is commanded to be perfect—He
will be a father of many nations—His
name is changed to Abraham—The Lord
covenants to be a God unto Abraham
and his seed forever—Also, the Lord
gives Abraham the land of Canaan for
an everlasting possession—Circumcision becomes a token of the everlasting
covenant between God and Abraham—
Sarai’s name is changed to Sarah—She
will bear Isaac, with whom the Lord will
establish His covenant—Abraham and
the men of his house are circumcised.
And when Abram was ninety years
old and nine, the Lord a appeared
to b Abram, and said unto him, I am
the c Almighty God; d walk before
me, and be thou e perfect.
2 And I will make my a covenant
between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.
3 a And Abram fell on his face: and
God talked with him, saying,
4 As for me, behold, my a covenant
is with thee, and thou shalt be a
b 
father of many c nations.

5 Neither shall thy name any more
be called Abram, but thy name shall
be a Abraham; for a father of many
nations have I made thee.
6 And I will make thee exceeding
a 
fruitful, and I will make b nations

22 And he left off talking with him,
and God went up from Abraham.
23 ¶ And Abraham took Ishmael
his son, and all that were born in
his house, and all that were bought
with his money, every male among
the men of Abraham’s house; and
a 
circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had
said unto him.
24 And Abraham was ninety years
old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his
son.
27 And all the men of his house,
born in the house, and bought with
money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.
Chapter 18
Abraham entertains three holy men—
They promise that Sarah will have a
son—Abraham will command his children to be just—The Lord appears to
him—They discuss the destruction of
Sodom and Gomorrah.
And the Lord a appeared unto him
in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in
the tent door in the heat of the day;
2 And he lift up his eyes and
looked, and, lo, three a men stood
by him: and when he saw them, he
ran to meet them from the tent
door, and b bowed himself toward
the ground,
3 And said, My a Lord, if now I have
found favour in thy sight, pass not
away, I pray thee, from thy servant:

and a comfort ye your hearts; after
that ye shall pass on: for therefore
are ye b come to your servant. And
they said, So do, as thou hast said.
6 And Abraham hastened into the
tent unto Sarah, and said, Make
ready quickly three measures of
fine meal, knead it, and make cakes
upon the hearth.
7 And Abraham ran unto the herd,
and fetcht a calf tender and good,
and gave it unto a young man; and
he hasted to dress it.
8 And he took butter, and milk,
and the calf which he had dressed,
and set it before them; and he stood
by them under the tree, and they
did eat.
9 ¶ And they said unto him, Where
is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
10 And he said, I will certainly
return unto thee according to the
time of life; and, lo, a Sarah thy wife
shall have a b son. And Sarah heard
it in the tent door, which was behind him.
11 Now Abraham and Sarah were
a 
old and well stricken in age; and it
b 
ceased to be with Sarah after the
manner of women.
12 Therefore Sarah laughed within
herself, saying, After I am waxed
old shall I have pleasure, my lord
being a old also?
13 And the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah a laugh,
saying, Shall I of a surety bear a
child, which am b old?
14 Is any thing too a hard for the
Lord? At the time appointed I will

15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I
laughed not; for she was afraid. And
he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
16 ¶ And the men rose up from
thence, and looked toward Sodom:
and Abraham went with them to
bring them on the way.
17 And the Lord said, Shall I a hide
from Abraham that thing which I do;
18 Seeing that Abraham shall
surely become a great and mighty
a 
nation, and all the b nations of the
earth shall be c blessed in him?
19 For I a know him, that he will
b 
command his c children and his
d 
household after him, and they
shall e keep the way of the Lord, to
do justice and f judgment; that the
Lord may bring upon Abraham
that which he hath spoken of him.
20 And the Lord said, Because
the a cry of Sodom and Gomorrah
is great, and because their b sin is
very grievous;
21 I will go down now, and see
whether they have done altogether
according to the cry of it, which
is come unto me; and if not, I will
a 
know.
22  a And the men turned their
faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham b stood
yet before the Lord.
23 ¶ And Abraham drew near, and
said, Wilt thou also a destroy the
b 
righteous with the c wicked?

righteous within the city: wilt thou

place for the fifty righteous that
are therein?
25 That be far from thee to do
after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the
righteous should be as the wicked,
that be far from thee: Shall not the
a 
Judge of all the earth do right?
26 And the Lord said, If I find in
Sodom fifty a righteous within the
city, then I will spare all the place
for their sakes.
27 And Abraham answered and
said, Behold now, I have taken upon
me to speak unto the Lord, which
am but a dust and ashes:
28 Peradventure there shall lack
five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou
destroy all the city for lack of five?
And he said, If I find there forty
and five, I will not destroy it.
29 And he spake unto him yet
again, and said, Peradventure there
shall be forty found there. And he
said, I will not do it for forty’s sake.

the Lord be angry, and I will speak:
Peradventure there shall thirty be
found there. And he said, I will not
do it, if I find thirty there.
31 And he said, Behold now, I have
taken upon me to speak unto the
Lord: Peradventure there shall be
twenty found there. And he said,
I will not destroy it for twenty’s
sake.

Lot entertains holy men—The men
of Sodom seek to abuse Lot’s guests
and are smitten with blindness—Lot
is sent out of Sodom—The Lord rains
brimstone and fire upon Sodom and
Gomorrah—Lot’s daughters preserve
his seed in the land.
And there came a two b angels to
Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the
gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them
rose up to meet them; and he bowed
himself with his face toward the
ground;
2 And he said, Behold now, my
lords, turn in, I pray you, into your
servant’s house, and tarry all night,
and a wash your feet, and ye shall
rise up early, and go on your ways.
And they said, Nay; but we will

greatly; and they turned in unto him,
and entered into his house; and he
made them a a feast, and did bake

men of the city, even the men of
Sodom, compassed the house round,

from every quarter:

said unto him, Where are the men

me, I pray you, bring them out unto
you, and do ye to them as is good in
your eyes: only unto these men do
nothing; for therefore c came they
under the shadow of my roof.
9 And they said, Stand back. And
they said again, This one fellow came
in to a sojourn, and he will needs
be a judge: now will we deal worse
with thee, than with them. And
they pressed sore upon the man,
even Lot, and came near to break the
door.
10 But the men put forth their
hand, and pulled Lot into the house
to them, and shut to the door.
11 And they smote the men that
were at the door of the house with
a 
blindness, both small and great:
so that they wearied themselves to
find the door.
12 ¶ And a the men said unto Lot,

city, b bring them out of this place:

because the a cry of them is waxen

unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up,

Lord will destroy this city. But he
seemed as one that c mocked unto

15 ¶ And when the morning arose,
then the a angels hastened b Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy
two daughters, which are here; lest
thou be consumed in the iniquity
of the city.
16 And while he lingered, the men
laid hold upon his hand, and upon
the hand of his wife, and upon the
hand of his two daughters; the Lord
being a merciful unto him: and they
brought him forth, and set him
without the city.
17 ¶ And it came to pass, when
they had brought them forth abroad,
that he said, Escape for thy life;
a 
look not behind thee, neither stay
thou in all the plain; escape to the
b 
mountain, lest thou be consumed.
18 And Lot said unto them, Oh,
not so, my Lord:
19 Behold now, thy servant hath
found a grace in thy sight, and thou
hast magnified thy mercy, which
thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to
the mountain, lest some evil take
me, and I die:
20 Behold now, this city is near to
flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh,
let me escape thither, (is it not a
little one?) and my soul shall live.
21 And he said unto him, See, I
have a accepted thee concerning
this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou
hast spoken.
22 Haste thee, escape thither; for
I cannot do any thing till thou be
come thither. Therefore the name
of the city was called a Zoar.

25 And he overthrew those cities,
and all the plain, and all the inhabi­

grew upon the ground.
26 ¶ But his wife a looked back
from behind him, and she became

27 ¶ And Abraham gat up early
in the morning to the place where
he stood before the Lord:
28 And he looked toward Sodom
and Gomorrah, and toward all the
land of the plain, and beheld, and,
lo, the a smoke of the country went
up as the smoke of a furnace.
29 ¶ And it came to pass, when
God destroyed the cities of the
plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst
of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot
dwelt.
30 ¶ And Lot went up out of Zoar,
and dwelt in the a mountain, and
his two daughters with him; for
he feared to dwell in Zoar: and
he dwelt in a cave, he and his two
daughters.

thou in, and lie with him, that we
may preserve seed of our father.
35 a And they made their father
drink wine that night also: and the
younger arose, and lay with him;
and he perceived not when she lay
down, nor when she arose.
36 Thus were both the daughters
of Lot with child by their father.
37 And the firstborn bare a son,
and called his name a Moab: the
same is the father of the b Moabites
unto this day.
38 And the younger, she also bare
a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the
children of a Ammon unto this day.
Chapter 20
Abimelech desires Sarah, who is preserved by the Lord—Abraham prays
for Abimelech, and the Lord blesses
him and his household.
And Abraham journeyed from
thence toward the south country,
and dwelled between Kadesh and
a 
Shur, and sojourned in b Gerar.
2 And Abraham said of Sarah his
wife, She is my sister: and a Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and
took Sarah.
3 But a God came to Abimelech in
a dream by night, and said to him,
Behold, thou art but a dead man, for
the woman which thou hast taken;
for she is a man’s wife.
4 But Abimelech had not come

near her: and he said, Lord, wilt
thou slay also a a righteous nation?
5 Said he not unto me, She is my
a 
sister? and she, even she herself
said, He is my b brother: in the c integrity of my heart and innocency
of my hands have I done this.
6 And God said unto him in a
dream, Yea, I know that thou didst
this in the integrity of thy heart;
for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered
I thee not to touch her.
7 Now therefore restore the man
his wife; for he is a prophet, and he
shall a pray for thee, and thou shalt
live: and if thou restore her not,
know thou that thou shalt surely
die, thou, and all that are thine.
8 Therefore Abimelech rose early
in the morning, and called all his
servants, and told all these things
in their ears: and the men were
sore afraid.
9 Then a Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What
hast thou b done unto us? and what
have I offended thee, that thou hast
brought on me and on my kingdom
a great sin? thou hast c done deeds
unto me that ought not to be done.
10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou
hast done this thing?
11 And Abraham said, Because I
thought, Surely the a fear of God is
not in this place; and they will slay
me for my wife’s sake.
12 And yet indeed she is my a sister;
she is the daughter of my father,
but not the daughter of my mother;
and she became my wife.
13 And it came to pass, when God
caused me to a wander from my
father’s house, that I said unto her,

14 And Abimelech took sheep,
and oxen, and menservants, and
womenservants, and gave them unto
Abraham, and restored him Sarah
his wife.
15 And Abimelech said, Behold,
my a land is before thee: dwell where
it pleaseth thee.
16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold,
I have given thy a brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is
to thee a covering of the eyes, unto
all that are with thee, and with all
other: thus she was reproved.
17 ¶ So Abraham prayed unto
God: and God healed Abimelech,
and his wife, and his maidservants;
and they bare children.
18 For the Lord had fast a closed
up all the wombs of the house
of Abimelech, because of Sarah
Abraham’s wife.
Chapter 21
Sarah bears Isaac—He is circumcised
—Hagar and her son are cast out

saves Hagar and Ishmael—Abraham

And the Lord a visited Sarah as he
had said, and the Lord did unto
b 
Sarah as he had spoken.

4 And Abraham a circumcised his

God had commanded him.
5 And Abraham was an a hundred
years old, when his son Isaac was
born unto him.
6 ¶ And Sarah said, God hath made
me to a laugh, so that all that hear
will laugh with me.
7 And she said, Who would have
said unto Abraham, that Sarah
should have given children suck? for
I have born him a son in his a old age.
8 And the child grew, and was
weaned: and Abraham made a great
feast the same day that Isaac was
weaned.
9 ¶ And Sarah saw the son of a Hagar the Egyptian, which she had
b 
born unto Abraham, c mocking.
10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, a Cast out this bondwoman and
her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be b heir with my

Hagar, putting it on her shoulder,
and the child, and a sent her away:
and she departed, and wandered
in the wilderness of b Beer-sheba.
15 And the water was spent in the
bottle, and she cast the child under
one of the shrubs.
16 And she went, and sat her down
over against him a good way off, as
it were a bowshot: for she said, Let
me not see the death of the child.
And she sat over against him, and
lift up her voice, and wept.
17 And God heard the voice of the
lad; and the a angel of God called to
Hagar out of heaven, and said unto
her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear
not; for God hath heard the voice
of the lad where he is.
18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold
him in thine hand; for I will make
him a great a nation.
19 And God a opened her eyes, and
she saw a well of water; and she
went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
20 And God was with the lad; and
he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an a archer.
21 And he dwelt in the wilderness
of Paran: and his mother took him
a a wife out of the land of b Egypt.
22 ¶ And it came to pass at that
time, that a Abimelech and b Phichol

unto Abraham, saying, c God is with

25 And Abraham a reproved Abime­
lech because of a well of water,
which Abimelech’s servants b had
violently taken away.
26 And Abimelech said, I wot not
who hath done this thing: neither
didst thou tell me, neither yet heard
I of it, but to day.
27 And Abraham took sheep and
oxen, and gave them unto Abime­
lech; and both of them a made a
covenant.
28 And Abraham set seven ewe
lambs of the flock by themselves.
29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe
lambs which thou hast set by themselves?
30 And he said, For these seven ewe
lambs shalt thou take of my hand,
that they may be a witness unto
me, that I have digged this a well.
31 Wherefore he called that place
a 
Beer-sheba; because there they
sware both of them.
32 Thus they made a covenant at

up, and Phichol the chief captain
of his host, and they returned into

and he said, Behold, here I am.
2 And he said, a Take now thy son,
thine b only son Isaac, whom thou
c 
lovest, and get thee into the land of
d 
Moriah; and offer him there for
a burnt offering upon one of the
mountains which I will tell thee of.
3 ¶ And Abraham rose up early in
the morning, and saddled his ass,
and took two of his young men with
him, and Isaac his son, and clave the
a 
wood for the burnt offering, and
rose up, and went unto the place
of which God had told him.
4 Then on the third day Abraham
lifted up his eyes, and saw the place
afar off.
5 And Abraham said unto his
young men, Abide ye here with
the ass; and I and the lad will go
yonder and a worship, and come

he said, a Here am I, my son. And he
said, Behold the fire and the wood:
but where is the lamb for a burnt

will provide himself a a lamb for a

went together to Beer-sheba; and
Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.

these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, a Milcah, she
hath also born children unto thy
brother Nahor;

brother, and Kemuel the father of

7 And Abraham stood up, and
bowed himself to the people of the
land, even to the children of Heth.
8 And he communed with them,
saying, If it be your mind that I
should bury my dead out of my
sight; hear me, and entreat for me
to Ephron the son of Zohar,
9 That he may give me the cave of
a 
Machpelah, which he hath, which is
in the end of his field; for as much
money as it is worth he shall give
it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.
10 And Ephron dwelt among the
children of Heth: and Ephron the
Hittite answered Abraham in the
audience of the children of Heth,
even of all that went in at the a gate
of his city, saying,
11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field
give I thee, and the cave that is
therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give
I it thee: bury thy dead.
12 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.
13 And he spake unto Ephron in
the audience of the people of the
land, saying, But if thou wilt give
it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give
thee money for the field; take it of
me, and I will bury my dead there.
14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,
15 My lord, hearken unto me: the
land is worth four hundred a shekels
of silver; what is that betwixt me
and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16 And Abraham hearkened unto

Ephron; and Abraham b weighed to

named in the audience of the sons of

all the trees that were in the field,
that were in all the borders round
about, were made sure

19 And after this, Abraham buried

20 And the field, and the cave
that is therein, were made sure

Abraham commands that Isaac shall

And Abraham was old, and well
a

2 And Abraham said unto his eldest a servant of his house, that ruled
over all that he had, Put, I pray thee,

3 And I will make thee a swear by

5 And the servant said unto him,
a 
Peradventure the woman will not
be willing to follow me unto this
land: must I needs bring thy son
again unto the land from whence
thou camest?
6 And Abraham said unto him,
Beware thou that thou bring not
my son thither again.
7 ¶ The a Lord God of heaven,
which took me from my b father’s
house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and
that sware unto me, saying, Unto
thy seed will I give this c land; he
shall send his d angel before thee,
and thou shalt take a wife unto my
son from thence.
8 And if the woman will not be
willing to follow thee, then thou
shalt be clear from this my oath:

9 And the servant put his hand
under the a thigh of Abraham his
master, and sware to him concerning that matter.
10 ¶ And the servant took ten
camels of the camels of his master,
and departed; for all the goods of
his master were in his hand: and he
arose, and went to a Mesopotamia,

11 And he made his camels to kneel
down without the city by a well of
water at the time of the evening,
even the time that women go out
to draw water.
12 And he said, O a Lord God of my
master Abraham, I pray thee, b send
me good speed this day, and shew
kindness unto my master Abraham.

13 Behold, I stand here by the well
of water; and the daughters of the
men of the city come out to draw
a 
water:
14 And let it come to pass, that the
damsel to whom I shall say, Let down
thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may
drink; and she shall say, Drink, and
I will give thy camels drink also: let
the same be she that thou hast a appointed for thy servant Isaac; and
thereby shall I know that thou hast
shewed kindness unto my master.
15 ¶ And it came to pass, before
he had done speaking, that, behold,
Rebekah came out, who was born to
a 
Bethuel, son of b Milcah, the wife
of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with
her pitcher upon her shoulder.
16 And the damsel was very a fair
to look upon, a virgin, neither had
any man b known her: and she went
down to the well, and filled her
pitcher, and came up.
17 And the servant ran to meet
her, and said, Let me, I pray thee,
drink a little water of thy pitcher.
18 And she said, Drink, my lord:
and she hasted, and let down her
pitcher upon her hand, and gave
him drink.
19 And when she had done giving
him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they
have done drinking.
20 And she hasted, and emptied
her pitcher into the trough, and ran
again unto the well to draw water,
and drew for all his camels.
21 And the man wondering at her
held his peace, to wit whether the
Lord had made his journey a prosperous or not.
22 And it came to pass, as the
camels had done drinking, that the
man took a golden a earring of half
a shekel weight, and two bracelets

for her hands of ten shekels weight
of gold;
23 And said, Whose daughter art
thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there
room in thy father’s house for us
to lodge in?
24 And she said unto him, I am
the daughter of Bethuel the son
of Milcah, which she bare unto
a 
Nahor.
25 She said moreover unto him,
We have both straw and provender
enough, and room to lodge in.
26 And the man a bowed down his
head, and worshipped the Lord.
27 And he said, Blessed be the
a 
Lord God of my master Abraham,
who hath not left destitute my master of his b mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the Lord c led me to
the house of my master’s brethren.
28 And the damsel ran, and told
them of her mother’s house these
things.
29 ¶ And Rebekah had a brother,
and his name was Laban: and a Laban
ran out unto the man, unto the well.
30 And it came to pass, when
he saw the earring and bracelets
upon his sister’s hands, and when
he heard the words of Rebekah his
sister, saying, Thus spake the man
unto me; that he came unto the
man; and, behold, he stood by the
camels at the well.
31 And he said, Come in, thou
a 
blessed of the Lord; wherefore
standest thou without? for I have
prepared the house, and room for
the camels.
32 ¶ And the man came into the
house: and he ungirded his camels,
and gave straw and a provender for
the camels, and water to b wash his
feet, and the men’s feet that were
with him.

And he said, Speak on.
34 And he said, I am Abraham’s
servant.
35 And the Lord hath a blessed my
master greatly; and he is become
b 
great: and he hath given him flocks,
and herds, and silver, and gold, and
menservants, and maidservants,
and camels, and asses.
36 And Sarah my master’s wife
bare a a son to my master when she
was b old: and unto him hath he
c 
given all that he hath.
37 And my master made me a swear,
saying, Thou shalt not take a wife
to my son of the daughters of the
Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:
38 But thou shalt go unto my
a 
father’s house, and to my kindred,
and take a wife unto my son.
39 And I said unto my master,
a 
Peradventure the woman will not
follow me.
40 And he said unto me, The a Lord,
before whom I b walk, will send his
angel with thee, and prosper thy
way; and thou shalt take a wife for
my son of my kindred, and of my
father’s house:
41 Then shalt thou be clear from
this my oath, when thou comest to
my kindred; and if they give not
thee one, thou shalt be clear from
my oath.
42 And I came this day unto the
well, and said, O Lord God of my
master Abraham, if now thou do
prosper my way which I go:
43 Behold, I stand by the well of
water; and it shall come to pass,
that when the virgin cometh forth
to draw water, and I say to her, Give
me, I pray thee, a little water of thy
pitcher to drink;

thou, and I will also draw for thy

45 And before I had done speaking in mine a heart, behold, Rebekah
came forth with her pitcher on her
shoulder; and she went down unto
the well, and drew water: and I
said unto her, Let me drink, I pray
thee.
46 And she made haste, and let
down her pitcher from her shoulder,
and said, Drink, and I will give thy
camels drink also: so I drank, and
she made the camels drink also.
47 And I asked her, and said, Whose
daughter art thou? And she said, The
daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son,
whom Milcah bare unto him: and
I put the a earring upon her face,
and the bracelets upon her hands.
48 And I a bowed down my head,
and worshipped the Lord, and
blessed the Lord God of my master Abraham, which had led me in
the right way to take my master’s
brother’s b daughter unto his son.
49 And now if ye will deal kindly
and truly with my master, tell me:
and if not, tell me; that I may turn
to the right hand, or to the left.
50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the Lord: we cannot
a 
speak unto thee bad or good.
51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee,
take her, and go, and let her be thy
master’s son’s a wife, as the Lord
hath spoken.
52 And it came to pass, that, when
Abraham’s servant heard their
words, he worshipped the Lord,
bowing himself to the earth.
53 And the servant brought forth
a 
jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,
and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother
and to her mother precious things.

54 And they did eat and drink, he
and the men that were with him, and
tarried all night; and they rose up
in the morning, and he said, Send
me away unto my master.
55 And her brother and her mother
said, Let the damsel abide with us a
few days, at the least ten; after that
she shall go.
56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the Lord hath
a 
prospered my way; send me away
that I may go to my master.
57 And they said, We will call the
damsel, and inquire at her mouth.
58 And they called Rebekah, and
said unto her, Wilt thou go with
this man? And she said, I will go.
59 And they sent away Rebekah
their sister, and her a nurse, and
Abraham’s servant, and his men.
60 And they blessed Rebekah, and
said unto her, Thou art our sister,
be thou the a mother of thousands
of millions, and let thy seed possess the b gate of those which c hate
them.
61 ¶ And Rebekah arose, and her
damsels, and they rode upon the
camels, and followed the man: and
the servant took Rebekah, and went
his way.
62 And Isaac came from the way
of the a well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt
in the south country.
63 And Isaac went out to a meditate
in the field at the eventide: and he
lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.
64 And Rebekah lifted up her
eyes, and when she saw Isaac, a she
lighted off the camel.
65 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh
in the field to meet us? And the
servant had said, It is my master:

therefore she took a veil, and covered herself.
66 And the servant told Isaac all
things that he had done.
67 And Isaac brought her into his
mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife;
and he loved her: and Isaac was
a 
comforted after his mother’s b death.

begat Isaac:
20 And Isaac was forty years old
when he took Rebekah to wife, the
daughter of a Bethuel the Syrian of
b 
Padan-aram, the sister to Laban
the Syrian.
21 And Isaac entreated the Lord
for his a wife, because she was b barren: and the Lord was c entreated
of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it
be so, why am I thus? And she went
to a inquire of the Lord.
23 And the Lord said unto her,
a 
Two nations are in thy womb, and
two manner of people shall be sepa­
rated from thy bowels; and the one
people shall be stronger than the
other people; and the b elder shall
serve the younger.
24 ¶ And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there
were twins in her womb.
25 And the first came out red, all
over like an a hairy garment; and
they called his name b Esau.
26 And after that came his brother
out, and his hand took hold on Esau’s
a 
heel; and his b name was called c Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years
old when she bare them.
27 And the boys grew: and Esau
was a cunning a hunter, a man of

man, dwelling in c tents.

28 And Isaac loved Esau, because
he did eat of his a venison: but b Rebekah loved Jacob.
29 ¶ And Jacob sod pottage: and
Esau came from the field, and he
was faint:
30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed
me, I pray thee, with that same red
pottage; for I am faint: therefore was
his name called a Edom.
31 And Jacob said, Sell me this
day thy a birthright.
32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at

shall this birthright do to me?
33 And Jacob said, Swear to me this
day; and he sware unto him: and
he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread
and pottage of lentiles; and he did

went his way: thus Esau despised

And there was a a famine in the
land, beside the first famine that
was in the days of Abraham. And
Isaac went unto b Abimelech king of
the c Philistines unto Gerar.
2 And the Lord appeared unto
him, and said, Go not down into

multiply as the stars of heaven, and

my voice, and kept my b charge, my

6 ¶ And Isaac dwelt in a Gerar:
7 And the men of the place asked
him of his wife; and he said, She is
my a sister: for he feared to say, She is
my wife; lest, said he, the men of the
place should kill me for Rebekah;
because she was b fair to look upon.
8 And it came to pass, when he
had been there a long time, that
Abimelech king of the Philistines
looked out at a window, and saw,
and, behold, Isaac was sporting with
Rebekah his wife.
9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and
said, Behold, of a surety she is thy
wife: and how saidst thou, She is
my sister? And Isaac said unto him,
Because I said, Lest I die for her.
10 And a Abimelech said, What is
this thou hast done unto us? one of
the people might lightly have b lien
with thy wife, and thou shouldest
have c brought guiltiness upon us.
11 And Abimelech charged all his
people, saying, He that toucheth
this man or his wife shall surely
be put to death.
12 Then Isaac sowed in that land,
and received in the same year
an a hundredfold: and the Lord

13 a And the man waxed b great,
and went forward, and grew until
he became very great:
14 For he had possession of flocks,
and possession of herds, and great
store of servants: and the Philistines
a 
envied him.

and pitched his tent in the valley
of Gerar, and dwelt there.
18 And Isaac digged again the wells
of water, which they had digged in
the days of Abraham his father; for
the Philistines had stopped them
after the death of Abraham: and
he called their a names after the
names by which his father had
called them.
19 And Isaac’s servants digged in
the valley, and found there a well
of springing water.
20 And the herdmen of Gerar did
a 
strive with Isaac’s herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called
the name of the well b Esek; because
they strove with him.
21 And they digged another well,
and strove for that also: and he
called the name of it a Sitnah.
22 And he a removed from thence,
and digged another well; and for
that they b strove not: and he called
the name of it c Rehoboth; and he
said, For now the Lord hath made
room for us, and we shall be d fruitful
in the land.

not, for c I am with thee, and will
bless thee, and multiply thy d seed

25 And he builded an a altar there,
and called upon the b name of the
Lord, and pitched his tent there:
and there Isaac’s servants digged
a well.
26 ¶ Then Abimelech went to him
from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of
his friends, and a Phichol the chief
captain of his army.
27 And Isaac said unto them,
Wherefore come ye to me, seeing
ye a hate me, and have sent me away
from you?
28 And they said, We saw certainly
that the a Lord was with thee: and
we said, Let there be now an oath

thee, and let us make a covenant
with thee;
29 That thou wilt do us no hurt,
as we have not touched thee, and
as we have done unto thee nothing

of the Lord.
30 And he made them a feast, and
they did eat and drink.
31 And they a rose up betimes in
the morning, and b sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and
they departed from him in peace.
32 And it came to pass the same
day, that Isaac’s servants came, and
told him concerning the well which
they had digged, and said unto him,
We have found water.

33 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is a Beersheba unto this day.
34 ¶ And Esau was forty years old
when he took to a wife Judith the
daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and
Bashemath the daughter of Elon
the Hittite:
35 Which were a a grief of mind
unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
Chapter 27
Rebekah guides Jacob in seeking blessings—Jacob is blessed to have dominion
and rule over peoples and nations—
Esau hates Jacob and plans to slay
him—Rebekah fears that Jacob may
marry one of the daughters of Heth.
And it came to pass, that when Isaac
was old, and his eyes were a dim,
so that he could not see, he called
Esau his eldest son, and said unto
him, My son: and he said unto him,
Behold, here am I.
2 And he said, Behold now, I am
old, I know not the day of my death:
3 Now therefore take, I pray thee,
thy weapons, thy a quiver and thy
bow, and go out to the field, and
b 
take me some venison;
4 And make me a savoury meat,
such as I love, and bring it to me,
that I may eat; that my soul may
bless thee before I die.
5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac
spake to Esau his son. And Esau
went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
6 ¶ And a Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard
thy father speak unto Esau thy
brother, saying,
7 Bring me venison, and make me
savoury meat, that I may eat, and
bless thee before the Lord before
my death.

I command thee.

11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his
mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a

12 My father peradventure will
feel me, and I shall seem to him as
a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse
upon me, and not a blessing.
13 And his mother said unto him,
Upon me be thy curse, my son: only
obey my voice, and go fetch me them.
14 And he went, and fetched, and
brought them to his mother: and his
mother made savoury meat, such as
his father loved.
15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which
were with her in the house, and put
them upon Jacob her younger son:
16 And she put the a skins of the
kids of the goats upon his hands,
and upon the smooth of his neck:
17 And she gave the savoury meat
and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son
Jacob.

and said, My father: and he said,
Here am I; who art thou, my son?
19 And Jacob said unto his father,
I am Esau thy firstborn; I have done
according as thou badest me: arise,
I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.
20 And Isaac said unto his son,
How is it that thou hast found it so
quickly, my son? And he said, Because the Lord thy God brought
it to me.

22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac
his father; and he felt him, and said,
The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the
hands are the hands of Esau.
23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his
brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed
him.
24 And he said, Art thou my very
son Esau? And he said, I am.
25 And he said, Bring it near to me,
and I will eat of my son’s venison,
that my soul may bless thee. And
he brought it near to him, and he
did eat: and he brought him wine,
and he drank.
26 And his father Isaac said unto
him, Come near now, and kiss me,
my son.
27 And he came a near, and kissed
him: and he smelled the smell of
his raiment, and b blessed him, and
said, See, the smell of my son is as
the smell of a field which the Lord
hath blessed:
28 Therefore God give thee of the
a 
dew of heaven, and the fatness of
the earth, and plenty of corn and
wine:
29 Let people a serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over
thy brethren, and let thy mother’s
sons b bow down to thee: cursed be
every one that curseth thee, and
c 
blessed be he that d blesseth thee.
30 ¶ And it came to pass, as soon
as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce
gone out from the presence of Isaac
his father, that Esau his brother
came in from his hunting.
31 And he also had made savoury
meat, and brought it unto his father,
and said unto his father, Let my
father arise, and eat of his son’s
venison, that thy soul may bless me.

him, Who art thou? And he said, I

33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where
is he that hath a taken venison, and
brought it me, and I have eaten of
all before thou camest, and have
b 
blessed him? yea, and he shall be
blessed.
34 And when Esau heard the words
of his father, he cried with a great
and exceeding bitter cry, and said
unto his father, Bless me, even me
also, O my father.
35 And he said, Thy brother came
with subtilty, and hath taken away
thy blessing.
36 And he said, Is not he rightly
named a Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took
away my b birthright; and, behold,
now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?
37 And Isaac answered and said
unto Esau, Behold, I have made
him thy lord, and all his brethren
have I given to him for a servants;
and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now
unto thee, my son?
38 And Esau said unto his father,
Hast thou but one blessing, my
father? bless me, even me also, O
my father. And Esau lifted up his
voice, and a wept.
39 And Isaac his father answered
and said unto him, Behold, thy

from above;

of the blessing wherewith his father
blessed him: and Esau said in his
heart, The days of mourning for
my father are at hand; then will I
slay my brother Jacob.
42 And these words of Esau her
elder son were told to Rebekah:
and she sent and called Jacob her
younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching
thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.
43 Now therefore, my son, obey
my voice; and arise, a flee thou to
Laban my b brother to c Haran;

45 Until thy brother’s a anger turn

which thou hast done to him: then
I will send, and fetch thee from
thence: why should I be deprived
also of you both in one day ?
46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I
am weary of my life because of the
a 
daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a
wife of the daughters of Heth, such
as these which are of the daughters
of the land, what good shall my
life do me?
Chapter 28
Isaac forbids Jacob to marry a Canaanite—He blesses Jacob and his seed with
the blessings of Abraham—Esau marries
a daughter of Ishmael—Jacob sees in vision a ladder reaching up into heaven—
The Lord promises him seed as the dust
of the earth in number—The Lord also
promises Jacob that in him and in his
seed all the families of the earth will be
blessed—Jacob covenants to pay tithes.
And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed
him, and charged him, and said unto
him, Thou shalt not take a a wife of

5 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and
he went to Padan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the a Syrian,
the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and
Esau’s mother.
6 ¶ When Esau saw that Isaac had
blessed Jacob, and sent him away
to Padan-aram, to take him a wife
from thence; and that as he blessed
him he gave him a charge, saying,
Thou shalt not take a wife of the

13 And, behold, the a Lord stood

his sleep, and he said, Surely the
Lord is in this place; and I knew it
not.
17 And he was afraid, and said,
How dreadful is this place! this is
none other but the house of God,
and this is the gate of a heaven.
18 And Jacob rose up early in the
morning, and took the stone that
he had put for his pillows, and set
it up for a a pillar, and poured oil
upon the top of it.
19 And he called the name of that
place a Beth-el: but the name of
that city was called b Luz at the first.

and will give me bread to eat, and

Jacob meets Rachel at the well—He
serves Laban seven years for her—
Laban gives to Jacob first Leah then
Rachel in marriage—Jacob serves another seven years—Leah bears Reuben,

Then Jacob went on his journey,
and came into the land of the people of the east.
2 And he looked, and behold a
well in the field, and, lo, there were
three flocks of sheep lying by it; for
out of that well they watered the
flocks: and a great stone was upon
the well’s mouth.
3 And thither were all the flocks
gathered: and they rolled the stone
from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone
again upon the well’s mouth in his
place.
4 And Jacob said unto them, My
brethren, whence be ye? And they
said, Of a Haran are we.
5 And he said unto them, Know
ye a Laban the son of Nahor? And
they said, We know him.
6 And he said unto them, Is he

and, behold, Rachel his daughter
cometh with the sheep.

9 ¶ And while he yet spake with
them, Rachel came with her father’s
sheep: for she kept them.
10 And it came to pass, when Jacob
saw Rachel the daughter of Laban
his mother’s brother, and the sheep
of Laban his mother’s brother, that
Jacob went near, and rolled the
stone from the well’s mouth, and
a 
watered the flock of Laban his

11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and
lifted up his voice, and wept.
12 And Jacob told Rachel that he
was her father’s brother, and that
he was Rebekah’s son: and she ran
and told her father.
13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his
sister’s son, that he ran to meet him,
and embraced him, and kissed
him, and brought him to his house.
And he told Laban all these things.
14 And Laban said to him, Surely
thou art my bone and my a flesh.
And he abode with him the space
of a month.
15 ¶ And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,
shouldest thou therefore serve me
for nought? tell me, what shall thy
wages be?
16 And Laban had two daughters:
the name of the elder was Leah, and
the name of the younger was Rachel.
17 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was a beautiful and well b favoured.
18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and
said, I will a serve thee seven years

him but a few days, for the b love he
had to her.
21 ¶ And Jacob said unto Laban,
Give me my wife, for my days are
fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
22 And Laban gathered together
all the men of the place, and made
a a feast.
23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he
went in unto her.
24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah a Zilpah his maid for an
handmaid.
25 And it came to pass, that in the
morning, behold, it was Leah: and
he said to Laban, What is this thou
hast done unto me? did not I serve
with thee for Rachel? wherefore
then hast thou beguiled me?
26 And Laban said, It must not
be so done in our country, to give
the younger before the a firstborn.
27 Fulfil her week, and we will
give thee this also for the service
which thou shalt serve with me yet
seven other years.
28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled
her week: and he gave him Rachel
his daughter to wife also.
29 And Laban gave to Rachel his
daughter a Bilhah his handmaid to
be her maid.
30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he a loved also Rachel
more than Leah, and b served with
him yet seven other years.

Leah was hated, he opened her

17 And God hearkened unto Leah,
and she conceived, and bare Jacob
the fifth son.

me my a hire, because I have given
my maiden to my husband: and she
called his name b Issachar.
19 And Leah conceived again, and
bare Jacob the sixth son.
20 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now

and she called his name b Zebulun.

and said, The Lord shall add to me

said unto Laban, Send me away, that
I may go unto mine own place, and
to my country.
26 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have a served thee,
and let me go: for thou knowest my
service which I have done thee.
27 And Laban said unto him, I
pray thee, if I have found favour in
thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned
by experience that the Lord hath

knowest how I have served thee, and
how thy cattle was with me.
30 For it was little which thou
hadst before I came, and it is now
increased unto a multitude; and
the Lord hath blessed thee since
my coming: and now when shall I
provide for mine own house also?
31 And he said, What shall I give
thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt
not give me any thing: if thou wilt
do this thing for me, I will again
feed and keep thy flock:
32 I will pass through all thy flock
to day, removing from thence all
the speckled and spotted a cattle,
and all the brown cattle among the
sheep, and the spotted and speckled
among the goats: and of such shall
be my hire.
33 So shall my a righteousness answer for me in time to come, when
it shall come for my hire before thy
face: every one that is not speckled

would it might be according to thy
word.
35 And he removed that day the

spotted, and all the she goats that
were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it,
and all the brown among the sheep,
and gave them into the hand of

38 And he set the rods which he
had pilled before the flocks in the
gutters in the watering troughs
when the flocks came to drink, that
they should conceive when they
came to drink.
39 And the flocks conceived before
the a rods, and brought forth cattle
ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.
40 And Jacob did separate the
lambs, and set the faces of the
flocks toward the ringstraked, and
all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by
themselves, and put them not unto
Laban’s cattle.
41 And it came to pass, whensoever
the stronger cattle did conceive, that
Jacob laid the rods before the eyes
of the cattle in the gutters, that they
might conceive among the rods.
42 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger
Jacob’s.

And he heard the words of Laban’s
sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away

4 And a Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his
flock,
5 And said unto them, I see your
father’s countenance, that it is not
toward me as before; but the God
of my father hath been with me.
6 And ye know that with all my
power I have served your father.
7 And your father hath deceived
me, and changed my wages ten
times; but God suffered him not
to hurt me.
8 If he said thus, The speckled shall
be thy wages; then all the cattle
bare speckled: and if he said thus,
The ringstraked shall be thy hire;
then bare all the cattle ringstraked.
9 Thus God hath taken away the
cattle of your father, and given
them to me.
10 And it came to pass at the time
that the a cattle conceived, that I
lifted up mine eyes, and saw in
a dream, and, behold, the rams
which leaped upon the cattle were
ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.
11 And the a angel of God spake
unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:
And I said, Here am I.
12 And he said, Lift up now thine
eyes, and see, all the rams which
leap upon the a cattle are ringstraked,

seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.

and said unto him, Is there yet any

hath quite devoured also our money.
16 For all the riches which God
hath taken from our father, that is
ours, and our children’s: now then,

thee, do.
17 ¶ Then Jacob rose up, and set
his sons and his wives upon camels;
18 And he carried away all his
cattle, and all his goods which he
had gotten, the cattle of his getting,
which he had gotten in Padan-aram,
for to go to Isaac his father in the
land of Canaan.
19 And Laban went to shear his
sheep: and Rachel had stolen the
a 
images that were her father’s.
20 And Jacob stole away unawares
to Laban the a Syrian, in that he told
him not that he fled.
21 So he fled with all that he had;
and he rose up, and passed over the
river, and set his face toward the
mount Gilead.
22 And it was told Laban on the
third day that Jacob was fled.
23 And he took his brethren with
him, and pursued after him seven
days’ journey; and they overtook
him in the mount Gilead.
24 And God came to Laban the
Syrian in a a dream by night, and
said unto him, Take heed that thou

speak not to Jacob either good or
bad.
25 ¶ Then Laban overtook Jacob.
Now Jacob had pitched his tent
in the mount: and Laban with his
brethren pitched in the mount of
Gilead.
26 And Laban said to Jacob, What
hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives
taken with the sword?
27 Wherefore didst thou flee away
secretly, and steal away from me;
and didst not tell me, that I might

hast now done foolishly in so doing.
29 It is in the power of my hand
to do you hurt: but the God of your
father spake unto me yesternight,
saying, Take thou heed that thou
speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
30 And now, though thou wouldest
needs be gone, because thou sore
longedst after thy father’s house, yet
wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?
31 And Jacob answered and said
to Laban, Because I was afraid: for
I said, Peradventure thou wouldest
take by force thy daughters from me.
32 With whomsoever thou findest
thy gods, let him not live: before
our brethren discern thou what is
thine with me, and take it to thee.
For Jacob knew not that Rachel had
stolen them.
33 And Laban went into Jacob’s
tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into
the two maidservants’ tents; but
he found them not. Then went he
out of Leah’s tent, and entered into
Rachel’s tent.
34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel’s
furniture, and sat upon them. And
Laban searched all the tent, but
found them not.
35 And she said to her father, Let
it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he
searched, but found not the images.
36 ¶ And Jacob was wroth, and
chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is
my trespass? what is my sin, that
thou hast so hotly pursued after me?
37 Whereas thou hast searched all
my stuff, what hast thou found of
all thy household stuff? set it here
before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt
us both.

have not cast their young, and the

require it, whether stolen by day, or
stolen by night.
40 Thus I was; in the day the
a

by night; and my sleep departed
from mine eyes.
41 Thus have I been twenty years
in thy house; I a served thee fourteen
years for thy two daughters, and
six years for thy cattle: and thou
hast changed my wages ten times.
42 Except the God of my father,
the God of Abraham, and the fear
of Isaac, had been with me, surely
thou hadst sent me away now empty.
God hath seen mine affliction and
the a labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.
43 ¶ And Laban answered and said
unto Jacob, These daughters are my
daughters, and these children are my
children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine:
and what can I do this day unto
these my daughters, or unto their
children which they have born?
44 Now therefore come thou, let

it up for a a pillar.

stones, and made an heap: and they
did eat there upon the heap.
47 And Laban called it a Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it

saying, Thus shall ye speak unto
my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob
saith thus, I have sojourned with
Laban, and stayed there until now:
5 And I have oxen, and asses,
flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell
my lord, that I may find grace in
thy sight.
6 ¶ And the messengers returned
to Jacob, saying, We came to thy
brother Esau, and also he cometh
to meet thee, and four hundred
men with him.
7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid
and a distressed: and he divided the
people that was with him, and the
flocks, and herds, and the camels,
into two bands;
8 And said, If Esau come to the
one company, and smite it, then
the other company which is left
shall escape.
9 ¶ And Jacob said, O a God of my
father Abraham, and God of my fa­
ther Isaac, the Lord which saidst
unto me, b Return unto thy country,
and to thy kindred, and I will deal
well with thee:
10 a I am not worthy of the least of
all the b mercies, and of all the truth,
which thou hast shewed unto thy
servant; for with my staff I passed
over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.
11 a Deliver me, I pray thee, from
the hand of my brother, from the
hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest
he will come and smite me, and the
mother with the children.
12 And thou saidst, I will surely do
thee good, and make thy a seed as

came to his hand a present for Esau

twenty he goats, two hundred ewes,
and twenty rams,
15 Thirty milch camels with their

twenty she asses, and ten foals.
16 And he delivered them into the
hand of his servants, every drove
by themselves; and said unto his
servants, Pass over before me, and
put a space betwixt drove and
drove.
17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother
meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither
goest thou? and whose are these
before thee?
18 Then thou shalt say, They be thy
servant Jacob’s; it is a present sent
unto my lord Esau: and, behold,
also he is behind us.
19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this
manner shall ye speak unto Esau,
when ye find him.
20 And say ye moreover, Behold,
thy servant Jacob is behind us.
For he said, I will appease him
with the present that goeth before
me, and afterward I will see his
face; peradventure he will accept
of me.
21 So went the present over before
him: and himself lodged that night
in the company.
22 And he rose up that night, and
took his two wives, and his two
womenservants, and his eleven sons,
and passed over the ford Jabbok.
23 And he took them, and sent
them over the brook, and sent over
that he had.

and her children after, and Rachel
and Joseph hindermost.
3 And he passed over before them,
and a bowed himself to the ground
seven times, until he came near to
his brother.
4 And Esau ran to meet him, and
embraced him, and fell on his neck,
and kissed him: and they wept.
5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw
the women and the children; and
said, Who are those with thee? And
he said, The children which God
hath graciously given thy servant.
6 Then the handmaidens came
near, they and their children, and
they bowed themselves.
7 And Leah also with her children
came near, and bowed themselves:
and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
8 And he said, What meanest thou
by all this drove which I met? And
he said, These are to find grace in
the sight of my lord.
9 And Esau said, I have enough,
my brother; keep that thou hast
unto thyself.
10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee,
if now I have found grace in thy sight,
then receive my present at my hand:
for therefore I have seen thy face, as
though I had seen the face of God,
and thou wast pleased with me.
11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing
that is brought to thee; because
God hath dealt graciously with me,
and because I have enough. And he
urged him, and he took it.
12 And he said, Let us take our
journey, and let us go, and I will
go before thee.
13 And he said unto him, My lord
knoweth that the children are tender,
and the flocks and herds with young
are with me: and if men should

overdrive them one day, all the

14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass
over before his servant: and I will
lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the
children be able to endure, until I
come unto my lord unto Seir.
15 And Esau said, Let me now leave
with thee some of the folk that are
with me. And he said, What needeth
it? let me find grace in the sight of
my lord.
16 ¶ So Esau returned that day on
his way unto Seir.
17 And Jacob journeyed to a Succoth, and built him an house, and
made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called
b 
Succoth.
18 ¶ And Jacob came to Shalem,
a city of Shechem, which is in the
land of Canaan, when he came from
Padan-aram; and pitched his tent
before the city.
19 And he bought a parcel of a
field, where he had spread his
tent, at the hand of the children
of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for an
hundred pieces of money.
20 And he erected there an altar,
and called it a El-elohe-Israel.
Chapter 34
Shechem defiles Dinah—The Hivites
seek to arrange marriages with Jacob’s
family—Many, having been circumcised, are slain by Simeon and Levi—
Jacob reproves his sons.
And Dinah the daughter of Leah,
which she bare unto Jacob, went
out to see the daughters of the
land.
2 And when Shechem the son of
a 
Hamor the Hivite, prince of the
country, saw her, he took her, and
lay with her, and defiled her.
3 And his soul clave unto Dinah
the daughter of Jacob, and he loved

the damsel, and spake kindly unto
the damsel.
4 And Shechem spake unto his
father Hamor, saying, Get me this
damsel to wife.
5 And Jacob heard that he had
defiled Dinah his daughter: now
his sons were with his cattle in the
field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.
6 ¶ And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
7 And the sons of Jacob came
out of the field when they heard
it: and the men were grieved, and
they were very a wroth, because he
had wrought folly in Israel in lying
with Jacob’s daughter; which thing
ought not to be done.
8 And Hamor communed with
them, saying, The soul of my son
Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.
9 And make ye marriages with us,
and give your daughters unto us,
and take our daughters unto you.
10 And ye shall dwell with us: and
the a land shall be before you; dwell
and b trade ye therein, and get you
possessions therein.
11 And Shechem said unto her
father and unto her brethren, Let
me find grace in your eyes, and what
ye shall say unto me I will give.
12 Ask me a never so much dowry
and gift, and I will give according
as ye shall say unto me: but give
me the damsel to wife.
13 And the sons of Jacob answered
Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had
defiled Dinah their sister:
14 a And they said unto them, We
cannot do this thing, to give our
sister to one that is b uncircumcised;
for that were a reproach unto us:
15 But in this will we consent unto
you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be a circumcised;

16 Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your
daughters to us, and we will dwell
with you, and we will become one
people.
17 But if ye will not hearken unto
us, to be circumcised; then will we
take our daughter, and we will be
gone.
18 And their words pleased Hamor,
and Shechem Hamor’s son.
19 And the young man deferred
not to do the thing, because he had
delight in Jacob’s daughter: and he
was more honourable than all the
house of his father.
20 ¶ And Hamor and Shechem his
son came unto the a gate of their
city, and communed with the men
of their city, saying,
21 These men are peaceable with
us; therefore let them dwell in the
land, and trade therein; for the land,
behold, it is large enough for them;
let us take their daughters to us
for wives, and let us give them our
daughters.
22 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,
to be one people, if every male
among us be circumcised, as they
are circumcised.
23 Shall not their cattle and their
substance and every beast of theirs
be ours? only let us consent unto
them, and they will dwell with us.
24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that
went out of the gate of his city; and
every male was circumcised, all
that went out of the gate of his city.
25 ¶ And it came to pass on the
third day, when they were sore, that
two of the sons of Jacob, a Simeon and
Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each
man his sword, and came upon the
city boldly, and slew all the males.
26 And they a slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the
sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went out.

	25	a	 Gen. 49:5 (5–7).

27 The sons of Jacob came upon
the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.
28 They took their sheep, and their
oxen, and their asses, and that which
was in the city, and that which was
in the field,
29 And all their wealth, and all
their little ones, and their wives
took they captive, and spoiled even
all that was in the house.
30 And Jacob said to Simeon and
Levi, Ye have troubled me to make
me to stink among the inhabitants
of the land, among the Canaanites
and the Perizzites: and I being few
in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay
me; and I shall be destroyed, I and
my house.
31 And they said, Should he deal
with our sister as with an harlot?
Chapter 35
God sends Jacob to Bethel, where he
builds an altar and the Lord appears
to him—God renews the promise that
Jacob will be a great nation and that his
name will be Israel—Jacob sets up an
altar and pours a drink offering—Rachel bears Benjamin, dies in childbirth,
and is buried near Bethlehem—Reuben
sins with Bilhah—Isaac dies and is
buried by Jacob and Esau.
And God said unto Jacob, Arise,
go up to Beth-el, and dwell there:
and make there an altar unto God,
that appeared unto thee when thou
a 
fleddest from the face of Esau thy
brother.
2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him,
Put away the strange a gods that
are among you, and be b clean, and
change your garments:
3 And let us arise, and go up to
Beth-el; and I will make there an
altar unto God, who answered me in
the day of my a distress, and was
with me in the way which I went.

4 And they gave unto Jacob all the
strange gods which were in their
hand, and all their earrings which
were in their ears; and Jacob hid
them under the oak which was by
Shechem.
5 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that
were round about them, and they did
not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
6 ¶ So Jacob came to a Luz, which
is in the land of Canaan, that is,
Beth-el, he and all the people that
were with him.
7 And he built there an altar, and
called the place El-beth-el: because
there God appeared unto him, when
he fled from the face of his brother.
8 But Deborah Rebekah’s a nurse
died, and she was buried beneath
Beth-el under an oak: and the name
of it was called b Allon-bachuth.
9 ¶ And God appeared unto Jacob
again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.
10 And God said unto him, Thy
name is Jacob: thy name shall not
be called any more Jacob, but a Israel
shall be thy name: and he called
his name Israel.
11 And God said unto him, I am
a 
God Almighty: be b fruitful and
multiply; a nation and a company
of c nations shall be of thee, and

kings shall come out of thy loins;
12 And the a land which I gave
Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will
give it, and to thy seed after thee
will I give the land.
13 And God went up from him in
the place where he talked with him.
14 And Jacob set up a a pillar in
the place where he talked with
him, even a pillar of stone: and he

15 And Jacob called the name of

him, Beth-el.
16 ¶ And they journeyed from
Beth-el; and there was but a little
way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard
labour.
17 And it came to pass, when she
was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou
shalt have this son also.
18 And it came to pass, as her soul
was in departing, (for she a died) that
she called his name b Ben-oni: but
his father called him c Benjamin.
19 And a Rachel died, and was buried in the way to b Ephrath, which

27 ¶ And Jacob came unto Isaac
his father unto Mamre, unto the city
of Arbah, which is Hebron, where
Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
28 And the a days of b Isaac were
an hundred and fourscore years.
29 And Isaac gave up the ghost,
and died, and was a gathered unto
his people, being old and full of
days: and his sons Esau and Jacob
b 
buried him.
Chapter 36
The descendants of Esau, who is Edom,
are listed.
Now these are the generations of
Esau, who is a Edom.
2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter
of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah
the daughter of Anah the daughter
of Zibeon the Hivite;
3 And B ashemath a  Ishmael’s
daughter, sister of Nebajoth.
4 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz;
and Bashemath bare Reuel;
5 And Aholibamah bare Jeush,
and Jaalam, and Korah: these are
the sons of Esau, which were born
unto him in the land of Canaan.
6 And Esau took his wives, and his
sons, and his daughters, and all the
persons of his house, and his cattle,
and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land
of Canaan; and went into the country
from the face of his brother Jacob.
7 For their riches were more than
that they might dwell together; and
the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of
their cattle.
8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount a Seir:
Esau is Edom.

their father loved him more than all
his brethren, they hated him, and
could not speak peaceably unto him.
5 ¶ And Joseph dreamed a a dream,
and he told it his brethren: and they
hated him yet the more.
6 And he said unto them, Hear, I
pray you, this dream which I have
dreamed:
7 For, behold, we were binding
sheaves in the field, and, lo, my
sheaf arose, and also stood upright;
and, behold, your sheaves stood
round about, and made a obeisance
to my sheaf.
8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt
thou indeed reign over us? or shalt
thou indeed have dominion over us?
And they hated him yet the more for
his dreams, and for his words.
9 ¶ And he dreamed yet another
dream, and told it his brethren,
and said, Behold, I have dreamed
a dream more; and, behold, the sun
and the moon and the eleven stars
made obeisance to me.
10 And he told it to his father,
and to his brethren: and his father
rebuked him, and said unto him,
What is this dream that thou hast
dreamed? Shall I and thy mother
and thy brethren indeed come to
a 
bow down ourselves to thee to the
earth?
11 And his brethren a envied him;
but his father observed the saying.
12 ¶ And his brethren went to feed
their father’s a flock in Shechem.
13 And Israel said unto Joseph,
Do not thy brethren feed the flock
in Shechem? come, and I will send
thee unto them. And he said to him,
Here am I.
14 And he said to him, Go, I pray
thee, see whether it be well with
thy brethren, and well with the
flocks; and bring me word again.
So he sent him out of the vale of
Hebron, and he came to Shechem.

the field: and the man asked him,
saying, What seekest thou?
16 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they
feed their flocks.
17 And the man said, They are
departed hence; for I heard them
say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and
found them in Dothan.
18 And when they saw him afar
off, even before he came near unto
them, they a conspired against him
to slay him.
19 And they said one to another,
Behold, this a dreamer cometh.
20 Come now therefore, and let us
slay him, and cast him into some
pit, and we will say, Some evil beast
hath devoured him: and we shall
see what will become of his dreams.
21 And a Reuben heard it, and he
delivered him out of their hands;
and said, Let us not kill him.
22 And Reuben said unto them,
Shed no blood, but cast him into
this pit that is in the wilderness,
and lay no hand upon him; that he
might rid him out of their hands,
to deliver him to his father again.
23 ¶ And it came to pass, when
Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of
his a coat, his coat of many colours
that was on him;
24 And they took him, and cast him
into a pit: and the pit was empty,
there was no water in it.
25 And they sat down to eat bread:
and they lifted up their eyes and
looked, and, behold, a company of
Ishmeelites came from Gilead with
their camels bearing spicery and
balm and myrrh, going to carry it
down to Egypt.
26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our
brother, and conceal his blood?
27 Come, and let us sell him to the
Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be
upon him; for he is our brother and

our flesh. And his brethren a were
content.
28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew
and lifted up Joseph out of the pit,
and sold Joseph to the a Ishmeelites
for twenty pieces of silver: and they
brought Joseph into Egypt.
29 ¶ And Reuben returned unto
the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not
in the pit; and he rent his clothes.
30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is a not; and
I, whither shall I go?
31 And they took Joseph’s coat,
and killed a kid of the goats, and
dipped the coat in the blood;
32 And they sent the coat of many
colours, and they brought it to their
father; and said, This have we found:
know now whether it be thy son’s
coat or no.
33 And he knew it, and said, It is
my son’s a coat; an evil beast hath
devoured him; Joseph is without
doubt b rent in pieces.
34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and
put sackcloth upon his loins, and
mourned for his son many days.
35 And all his a sons and all his
daughters rose up to comfort him;
but he refused to be b comforted;
and he said, For I will go down into

Thus his father wept for him.

that Judah went down from his
brethren, and turned in to a certain
Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
2 And Judah saw there a a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose
name was Shuah; and he took her,
and went in unto her.
3 And she conceived, and bare a
son; and he called his name a Er.
4 And she conceived again, and
bare a son; and she called his name
Onan.
5 And she yet again conceived,
and bare a son; and called his name
Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when
she bare him.
6 And Judah took a wife for Er his
firstborn, whose name was Tamar.
7 And a Er, Judah’s firstborn, was
wicked in the sight of the Lord;
and the Lord slew him.
8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in
unto thy brother’s a wife, and marry
her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
9 And Onan knew that the seed
should not be his; and it came to
pass, when he went in unto his
brother’s wife, that he spilled it on
the ground, lest that he should give
seed to his brother.
10 And the thing which he did
displeased the Lord: wherefore he
slew him also.
11 Then said Judah to Tamar his
daughter in law, Remain a widow
at thy father’s house, till Shelah
my son be grown: for he said, Lest
peradventure he die also, as his
brethren did. And Tamar went and
dwelt in her father’s house.
12 ¶ And in process of time the
daughter of Shuah Judah’s wife
died; and Judah was comforted, and
went up unto his sheepshearers to
Timnath, he and his friend Hirah
the Adullamite.

Genesis 38:14–39:2

Behold thy father in law goeth up
to Timnath to shear his sheep.
14 And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her
with a veil, and wrapped herself,
and sat in an open place, which is
by the way to Timnath; for she saw
that Shelah was grown, and she was
not given unto him to wife.
15 When Judah saw her, he thought
her to be an harlot; because she had
covered her face.
16 And he turned unto her by the
way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let
me come in unto thee; (for he knew
not that she was his daughter in
law.) And she said, What wilt thou
give me, that thou mayest come in
unto me?
17 And he said, I will send thee a
kid from the flock. And she said,
Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou
send it?
18 And he said, What pledge shall
I give thee? And she said, Thy a signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff
that is in thine hand. And he gave
it her, and came in unto her, and
she conceived by him.
19 And she arose, and went away,
and laid by her veil from her, and put
on the garments of her widowhood.
20 And Judah sent the kid by the
hand of his friend the Adullamite,
to receive his pledge from the woman’s hand: but he found her not.
21 Then he asked the men of that
place, saying, Where is the harlot,
that was openly by the way side?
And they said, There was no harlot
in this place.
22 And he returned to Judah, and
said, I cannot find her; and also the
men of the place said, that there
was no harlot in this place.
23 And Judah said, Let her take it to
her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent
this kid, and thou hast not found her.
24 ¶ And it came to pass about
three months after, that it was told

Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter

also, behold, she is with child by
whoredom. And Judah said, Bring
her forth, and let her be a burnt.
25 When she was brought forth, she
sent to her father in law, saying, By
the man, whose these are, am I with
child: and she said, Discern, I pray
thee, whose are these, the a signet,
and bracelets, and staff.
26 And Judah acknowledged them,
and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her
not to Shelah my son. And he knew
her again no more.
27 ¶ And it came to pass in the
time of her travail, that, behold,
twins were in her womb.
28 And it came to pass, when she
travailed, that the one put out his
hand: and the midwife took and
bound upon his hand a scarlet
thread, saying, This came out first.
29 And it came to pass, as he drew
back his hand, that, behold, his
brother came out: and she said,
How hast thou broken forth? this
breach be upon thee: therefore his
name was called a Pharez.
30 And afterward came out his
brother, that had the scarlet thread
upon his hand: and his name was
called a Zarah.

Joseph, prospered by the Lord, becomes

And Joseph was brought down to
Egypt; and a Potiphar, an officer of

of the b  Ishmeelites, which had

and he was a prosperous man; and
he was in the house of his master
the Egyptian.
3 And his master saw that the Lord
was with him, and that the Lord
made all that he did to a prosper
in his hand.
4 And Joseph found grace in his
sight, and he served him: and he
made him overseer over his house,
and all that he had he put into his
hand.
5 And it came to pass from the
time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that
he had, that the Lord blessed the
Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s a sake;
and the blessing of the Lord was
upon all that he had in the house,
and in the field.
6 And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not ought
he had, save the bread which he
did eat. And Joseph was a a goodly
person, and well b favoured.
7 ¶ And it came to pass after these
things, that his master’s wife cast
her a eyes upon Joseph; and she said,
Lie with me.
8 But he a refused, and said unto
his master’s wife, Behold, my master b wotteth not what is with me in
the house, and he hath c committed
all that he hath to my hand;

house than I; neither hath he kept
back any thing from me but thee,
because thou art his wife: how then
can I do this great a wickedness, and
b 
sin against God?
10 And it came to pass, as she
spake to Joseph a day by day, that
he hearkened not unto her, to lie
by her, or to be with her.
11 And it came to pass about this
time, that Joseph went into the
house to do his business; and there

was none of the men of the house
there within.
12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he
left his garment in her hand, and
a 
fled, and got him out.
13 And it came to pass, when she
saw that he had left his garment in
her hand, and was fled forth,
14 That she called unto the men
of her house, and spake unto them,
saying, See, he hath brought in an
Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came
in unto me to lie with me, and I
cried with a loud voice:
15 And it came to pass, when he
heard that I lifted up my voice and
cried, that he left his garment with
me, and fled, and got him out.
16 And she laid up his garment
by her, until his lord came home.
17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The
Hebrew servant, which thou hast
brought unto us, came in unto me
to mock me:
18 And it came to pass, as I lifted
up my voice and cried, that he left
his garment with me, and fled out.
19 And it came to pass, when
his master heard the words of his
wife, which she spake unto him,
saying, After this manner did thy
servant to me; that his wrath was
kindled.
20 And Joseph’s master took him,
and put him into the a prison, a
place where the king’s prisoners
were bound: and he was there in
the prison.
21 ¶ But the a Lord was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and
gave him favour in the sight of the
keeper of the prison.

prisoners that were in the prison; and

Joseph interprets the dreams of Pharaoh’s chief butler and chief baker—The
butler fails to tell Pharaoh about Joseph.
And it came to pass after these
things, that the butler of the king of
Egypt and his baker had offended
their lord the king of Egypt.
2 And Pharaoh was wroth against
two of his officers, against the chief
of the butlers, and against the chief
of the bakers.
3 And he put them in ward in the
house of the captain of the guard,
into the a prison, the place where
Joseph was bound.
4 And the captain of the guard
charged Joseph with them, and he
served them: and they continued a
season in ward.
5 ¶ And they dreamed a dream
both of them, each man his dream
in one night, each man according
to the interpretation of his dream,
the butler and the baker of the
king of Egypt, which were bound
in the prison.
6 And Joseph came in unto them
in the morning, and looked upon
them, and, behold, they were sad.
7 And he asked Pharaoh’s officers
that were with him in the ward of
his lord’s house, saying, Wherefore
look ye so sadly to day ?
8 And they said unto him, We
have dreamed a a dream, and there
is no interpreter of it. And Joseph
said unto them, Do not b interpretations belong to God? tell me them,
I pray you.
9 And the chief butler told his
dream to Joseph, and said to him,

overseer . . .
	23	a	 tg  Blessing.

In my dream, behold, a vine was
before me;
10 And in the vine were three
branches: and it was as though it
budded, and her blossoms shot forth;
and the clusters thereof brought
forth ripe grapes:
11 And Pharaoh’s cup was in my
hand: and I took the grapes, and
pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and
I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.
12 And Joseph said unto him, This
is the interpretation of it: The three
branches are three days:
13 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore
thee unto thy place: and thou shalt
deliver Pharaoh’s cup into his hand,
after the former manner when thou
wast his butler.
14 But think on me when it shall
be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make
mention of me unto Pharaoh, and
bring me out of this house:
15 For indeed I was stolen away
out of the land of the Hebrews:
and here also have I done nothing
that they should put me into the
dungeon.
16 When the chief baker saw that
the interpretation was good, he said
unto Joseph, I also was in my dream,
and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:
17 And in the uppermost basket
there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds
did eat them out of the basket upon
my head.
18 And Joseph answered and said,
This is the interpretation thereof:
The three baskets are three days:
19 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee,
and shall hang thee on a tree; and
the birds shall eat thy flesh from
off thee.
20 ¶ And it came to pass the third
day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday,
that he made a feast unto all his

servants: and he lifted up the head
of the chief butler and of the chief
baker among his servants.
21 And he restored the chief butler
unto his butlership again; and he
gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand:
22 But he hanged the chief baker:
as Joseph had interpreted to them.
23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but a forgat him.
Chapter 41
Pharaoh dreams of the cattle and the
ears of grain—Joseph interprets the
dreams as seven years of plenty and
seven of famine—He proposes a grain
storage program —Pharaoh makes
him ruler of all Egypt—Joseph marries Asenath—He gathers grain as the
sand upon the seashore—Asenath bears
Manasseh and Ephraim—Joseph sells
grain to Egyptians and others during
the famine.
And it came to pass at the end of two
full years, that Pharaoh a dreamed:
and, behold, he stood by the river.
2 And, behold, there came up out
of the river seven well favoured
kine and fatfleshed; and they fed
in a meadow.
3 And, behold, seven other kine
came up after them out of the river,
ill favoured and leanfleshed; and
stood by the other kine upon the
brink of the river.
4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven
well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
5 And he slept and dreamed the
second time: and, behold, seven ears
of corn came up upon one stalk,
rank and good.
6 And, behold, seven thin ears and
blasted with the east wind sprung
up after them.
7 And the seven thin ears devoured
the seven rank and full ears. And
Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was
a dream.

8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was a troubled; and
he sent and called for all the b magicians of Egypt, and all the wise
men thereof: and Pharaoh told them
his dream; but there was none that
could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
9 ¶ Then spake the chief butler
unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:
10 Pharaoh was wroth with his
servants, and put me in ward in
the captain of the guard’s house,
both me and the chief baker:
11 And we dreamed a dream in
one night, I and he; we dreamed
each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
12 And there was there with us a
young man, an Hebrew, servant to
the captain of the guard; and we
told him, and he interpreted to us
our dreams; to each man according
to his dream he did interpret.
13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him
he hanged.
14 ¶ Then a Pharaoh sent and called
Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the b dungeon: and he
shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.
15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
I have dreamed a dream, and there
is none that can interpret it: and I
have heard say of thee, that thou
canst understand a dream to a interpret it.
16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh,
saying, It is not in me: a God shall
give Pharaoh an answer of b peace.
17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
In my dream, behold, I stood upon
the bank of the river:
18 And, behold, there came up out
of the river seven kine, fatfleshed
and well favoured; and they fed in
a meadow:
19 And, behold, seven other kine
came up after them, poor and very

ill favoured and leanfleshed, such
as I never saw in all the land of
Egypt for badness:
20 And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first
seven fat kine:
21 And when they had eaten them
up, it could not be known that they
had eaten them; but they were still
ill favoured, as at the beginning.
So I awoke.
22 And I saw in my dream, and,
behold, seven ears came up in one
stalk, full and good:
23 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the
a 
east b wind, sprung up after them:
24 And the thin ears devoured the
seven good ears: and I told this unto
the magicians; but there was none
that could declare it to me.
25 ¶ And Joseph said unto Pharaoh,
The dream of Pharaoh is one: God
hath a shewed Pharaoh what he is
about to do.
26 The seven good kine are seven
years; and the seven good ears are
seven years: the dream is one.
27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them
are seven years; and the seven empty
ears blasted with the east wind shall
be seven years of a famine.
28 This is the thing which I have
spoken unto Pharaoh: What God
is about to do he sheweth unto
Pharaoh.
29 Behold, there come seven years
of great plenty throughout all the
land of Egypt:
30 And there shall arise after
them seven years of famine; and
all the plenty shall be forgotten in
the land of Egypt; and the a famine
shall consume the land;
31 And the plenty shall not be
known in the land by reason of

that famine following; for it shall
be very grievous.
32 And for that the dream was
doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is
because the thing is established by
God, and God will shortly bring it
to pass.
33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look
out a man discreet and wise, and set
him over the land of Egypt.
34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him
appoint officers over the land, and
take up the fifth part of the land of
Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
35 And let them gather all the
food of those good years that come,
and lay up corn under the hand of
Pharaoh, and let them keep food
in the cities.
36 And that food shall be for a store
to the land against the seven years
of famine, which shall be in the
land of Egypt; that the land perish
not through the famine.
37 ¶ And the thing was a good in
the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes
of all his servants.
38 And Pharaoh said unto his
servants, Can we find such a one as
this is, a man in whom the a Spirit
of God is?
39 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
Forasmuch as God hath a shewed
thee all this, there is none so discreet
and b wise as thou art:
40 Thou shalt be a over my house,
and according unto thy word shall
all my people be ruled: only in the
throne will I be b greater than thou.
41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
See, I have a set thee over all the
land of Egypt.

from his hand, and put it upon
Joseph’s hand, and b arrayed him
in c vestures of fine linen, and put

knee: and he made him a ruler over
all the land of Egypt.
44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I
am Pharaoh, and without thee shall
no man lift up his hand or foot in
all the land of Egypt.
45 And Pharaoh called Joseph’s
name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he
gave him to wife a Asenath the
daughter of Poti-pherah b priest of
On. And Joseph went out over all
the land of Egypt.
46 ¶ And a Joseph was thirty years
old when he stood before Pharaoh
king of Egypt. And Joseph went out
from the presence of Pharaoh, and
went throughout all the land of Egypt.
47 And in the seven plenteous
years the earth brought forth by
handfuls.
48 And he gathered up all the a food
of the seven years, which were in
the land of Egypt, and laid up the
food in the cities: the food of the
field, which was round about every
city, laid he up in the same.
49 And Joseph gathered corn as
the sand of the sea, very much,
until he left numbering; for it was
without number.
50 And unto Joseph were born
two sons before the years of famine
came, which Asenath the daughter
of Poti-pherah priest of On bare
unto him.
51 And Joseph called the name of
the firstborn a Manasseh: For God,
said he, hath made me forget all
my toil, and all my father’s house.
52 And the name of the second
called he a Ephraim: For God hath
caused me to be b fruitful in the
land of my affliction.

teousness, that was in the land of
Egypt, were ended.
54 And the seven years of a dearth
began to come, according as Joseph
had said: and the dearth was in all
lands; but in all the land of Egypt
there was bread.
55 And when all the land of Egypt
was famished, the people cried to
Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh
said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto
Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
56 And the famine was over all
the face of the earth: And Joseph
opened all the storehouses, and a sold
unto the Egyptians; and the famine
waxed sore in the land of Egypt.
57 And all countries came into
Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore
in all lands.
Chapter 42
Jacob sends his sons to buy grain in
Egypt—They bow before Joseph—He
makes harsh accusations against them,
imprisons Simeon, and sends them back
for Benjamin.
Now when Jacob saw that there
was a corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto
his sons, Why do ye look one upon
another?
2 And he said, Behold, I have
heard that there is corn in Egypt:
get you down thither, and buy for
us from thence; that we may live,
and not die.
3 ¶ And Joseph’s ten brethren went
down to buy a corn in Egypt.
4 But a Benjamin, Joseph’s brother,
Jacob sent not with his brethren; for
he said, Lest peradventure mischief
befall him.
5 And the sons of Israel came to buy
corn among those that came: for the
famine was in the land of Canaan.

6 And Joseph was the a governor
over the land, and he it was that sold
to all the people of the land: and
Joseph’s brethren came, and b bowed
down themselves before him with
their faces to the earth.
7 And Joseph saw his brethren,
and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake
roughly unto them; and he said
unto them, Whence come ye? And
they said, From the land of Canaan
to buy food.
8 And Joseph knew his brethren,
but they knew not him.
9 And Joseph remembered the
a 
dreams which he dreamed of them,
and said unto them, Ye are spies;
to see the nakedness of the land
ye are come.
10 And they said unto him, Nay,
my lord, but to buy food are thy
servants come.
11 We are all one a man’s sons; we
are true men, thy servants are no
spies.
12 And he said unto them, Nay,
but to see the nakedness of the land
ye are come.
13 And they said, Thy servants are
twelve brethren, the sons of one man
in the land of Canaan; and, behold,
the youngest is this day with our
father, and one is a not.
14 And Joseph said unto them,
That is it that I spake unto you,
saying, Ye are spies:
15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By
the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go
forth hence, except your youngest
brother come hither.
16 Send one of you, and let him
fetch your brother, and ye shall
be kept in prison, that your words
may be proved, whether there be any
truth in you: or else by the life of
Pharaoh surely ye are spies.
17 And he put them all together
into ward three days.
18 And Joseph said unto them the

fear God:
19 If ye be true men, let one of your
brethren be bound in the house of
your prison: go ye, carry corn for
the famine of your houses:
20 But bring your youngest brother
unto me; so shall your words be
verified, and ye shall not die. And
they did so.
21 ¶ And they said one to another,
We are verily a guilty concerning our
brother, in that we saw the anguish
of his soul, when he besought us,
and we would not hear; therefore
is this distress come upon us.
22 And a Reuben answered them,
saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child;
and ye would not hear? therefore,
behold, also his b blood is required.
23 And they knew not that Joseph
understood them; for he spake unto
them by an interpreter.
24 And he turned himself about
from them, and a wept; and returned
to them again, and communed with
them, and took from them Simeon,
and bound him before their eyes.
25 ¶ Then Joseph commanded to
fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man’s a money into his
sack, and to give them provision for
the way: and thus did he unto them.
26 And they laded their asses with
the corn, and departed thence.
27 And as one of them opened his
sack to give his ass provender in
the inn, he espied his a money; for,
behold, it was in his sack’s mouth.
28 And he said unto his brethren,
My money is restored; and, lo, it is
even in my sack: and their heart
failed them, and they were afraid,
saying one to another, What is this
that God hath done unto us?
29 ¶ And they came unto Jacob
their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell
unto them; saying,

30 The man, who is the lord of the
land, spake roughly to us, and took
us for spies of the country.
31 And we said unto him, We are
true men; we are no spies:
32 We be twelve brethren, sons
of our father; one is not, and the
youngest is this day with our father
in the land of Canaan.
33 And the man, the lord of the
country, said unto us, Hereby shall
I know that ye are true men; leave
one of your brethren here with me,
and take food for the famine of your
households, and be gone:
34 And bring your youngest
brother unto me: then shall I know
that ye are no spies, but that ye are
true men: so will I deliver you your
brother, and ye shall traffick in the
land.
35 ¶ And it came to pass as they
emptied their sacks, that, behold,
every man’s bundle of money was
in his sack: and when both they
and their father saw the bundles
of money, they were afraid.
36 And Jacob their father said unto
them, Me have ye bereaved of my
children: Joseph is not, and Simeon
is not, and ye will take a Benjamin
away: all these things are against me.
37 And a Reuben spake unto his
father, saying, Slay my two sons,
if I bring him not to thee: deliver
him into my hand, and I will bring
him to thee again.
38 And he said, My son shall not
go down with you; for his brother
is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the
which ye go, then shall ye bring
down my gray hairs with a sorrow
to the grave.
Chapter 43
Jacob is persuaded to send Benjamin to
Egypt—Joseph’s brothers show respect to
him—They all eat and drink together.
And the famine was sore in the land.
2 And it came to pass, when they
	36	a	 Gen. 44:29.
	37	a	 Gen. 42:22;
Num. 26:5.

had eaten up the corn which they
had brought out of Egypt, their
father said unto them, Go again,
buy us a little food.
3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest
unto us, saying, Ye shall not see
my face, except your a brother be
with you.
4 If thou wilt send our brother
with us, we will go down and buy
thee food:
5 But if thou wilt not send him, we
will not go down: for the man said
unto us, Ye shall not see my face,
except your a brother be with you.
6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt
ye so ill with me, as to tell the man
whether ye had yet a brother?
7 And they said, The man asked
us straitly of our state, and of our
kindred, saying, Is your father yet
alive? have ye another brother? and
we told him according to the tenor
of these words: could we certainly
know that he would say, Bring your
brother down?
8 And Judah said unto Israel his
father, Send the lad with me, and
we will arise and go; that we may
live, and not die, both we, and thou,
and also our little ones.
9 I will be surety for him; of my
hand shalt thou require him: if I
bring him not unto thee, and set
him before thee, then let me bear
the a blame for ever:
10 For except we had lingered,
surely now we had returned this
second time.
11 And their father Israel said unto
them, If it must be so now, do this;
take of the best fruits in the land
in your vessels, and carry down the
man a present, a little balm, and
a little honey, spices, and myrrh,
nuts, and almonds:
12 And take double money in your
hand; and the a money that was
brought again in the mouth of your
sacks, carry it again in your hand;
peradventure it was an oversight:

13 Take also your brother, and
arise, go again unto the man:
14 And God Almighty give you
mercy before the man, that he may
send away your other brother, and
Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my
children, I am bereaved.
15 ¶ And the men took that present, and they took double money
in their hand, and Benjamin; and
rose up, and went down to Egypt,
and stood before Joseph.
16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin
with them, he said to the ruler of
his house, Bring these men home,
and slay, and make ready; for these
men shall dine with me at noon.
17 And the man did as Joseph bade;
and the man brought the men into
Joseph’s house.
18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s house; and they said, Because
of the money that was returned
in our sacks at the first time are
we brought in; that he may seek
occasion against us, and fall upon
us, and take us for bondmen, and
our asses.
19 And they came near to the
steward of Joseph’s house, and they
communed with him at the door of
the house,
20 And said, O a sir, we came indeed
down at the first time to buy b food:
21 And it came to pass, when we
came to the inn, that we opened
our sacks, and, behold, every man’s
a 
money was in the mouth of his sack,
our money in full weight: and we
have brought it again in our hand.
22 And other money have we
brought down in our hands to buy
food: we cannot tell who put our
money in our sacks.
23 And he said, Peace be to you,
fear not: your God, and the God of
your father, hath given you treasure
in your sacks: I had your money.
And he brought Simeon out unto
them.

25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon:
for they heard that they should eat
bread there.
26 ¶ And when Joseph came home,
they brought him the present which
was in their hand into the house,
and a bowed themselves to him to
the earth.
27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well,
the old a man of whom ye spake? Is
he yet alive?
28 And they answered, Thy servant
our father is in good health, he is
yet alive. And they bowed down
their heads, and made obeisance.
29 And he lifted up his eyes, and
saw his brother a  Benjamin, his
mother’s son, and said, Is this your
younger brother, of whom ye spake
unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.
30 And Joseph made haste; for his
bowels did yearn upon his brother:
and he sought where to weep; and
he entered into his chamber, and
a 
wept there.
31 And he washed his face, and
went out, and refrained himself,
and said, Set on bread.
32 And they set on for him by
himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which
did eat with him, by themselves:
because the Egyptians might not
eat bread with the Hebrews; for
that is an a abomination unto the
Egyptians.
33 And they sat before him, the
firstborn according to his a birthright, and the youngest according
to his youth: and the men marvelled
one at another.
34 And he took and sent a messes
unto them from before him: but

Benjamin’s mess was five times

drank, and were merry with him.

Chapter 44
Joseph arranges to stop the return of
his brothers to Canaan—Judah offers
himself in place of Benjamin for their
father’s sake.
And he commanded the steward
of his house, saying, Fill the men’s
sacks with food, as much as they can
carry, and put every man’s money
in his sack’s mouth.
2 And put my cup, the silver cup,
in the sack’s mouth of the youngest,
and his corn money. And he did
according to the word that Joseph
had spoken.
3 As soon as the morning was light,
the men were sent away, they and
their asses.
4 And when they were gone out
of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou
dost overtake them, say unto them,
Wherefore have ye rewarded evil
for good?
5 Is not this it in which my lord
drinketh, and whereby indeed he
divineth? ye have done evil in so
doing.
6 ¶ And he overtook them, and he
spake unto them these same words.
7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God
forbid that thy servants should do
according to this thing:
8 Behold, the money, which we
found in our sacks’ mouths, we
brought again unto thee out of the
land of Canaan: how then should
we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold?
9 With whomsoever of thy servants
it be found, both let him die, and
we also will be my lord’s bondmen.
10 And he said, Now also let it
be according unto your words: he
	

34	b	 Gen. 45:22.

44	13	a	 Job 1:20;

Eccl. 3:7;

with whom it is found shall be my
servant; and ye shall be blameless.
11 Then they speedily took down
every man his sack to the ground,
and opened every man his sack.
12 And he searched, and began at
the eldest, and left at the youngest:
and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.
13 Then they a rent their clothes,
and laded every man his ass, and
returned to the city.
14 ¶ And Judah and his brethren
came to Joseph’s house; for he was
yet there: and they a fell before him
on the ground.
15 And Joseph said unto them,
What deed is this that ye have done?
wot ye not that such a man as I can
certainly divine?
16 And Judah said, What shall we
say unto my lord? what shall we
speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we
are my lord’s servants, both we, and
he also with whom the cup is found.
17 And he said, God forbid that I
should do so: but the man in whose
hand the cup is found, he shall be
my servant; and as for you, get you
up in peace unto your father.
18 ¶ Then Judah came near unto
him, and said, Oh my a lord, let thy
servant, I pray thee, speak a word
in my lord’s ears, and let not thine
b 
anger burn against thy servant: for
thou art even as Pharaoh.
19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?
20 And we said unto my lord, We
have a father, an old a man, and a
child of his old age, a little one; and
his brother is dead, and he alone
is left of his mother, and his father
loveth him.
21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me,
that I may set mine eyes upon him.

24 And it came to pass when we
came up unto thy servant my father,
we told him the words of my lord.
25 And our father said, Go again,
and buy us a little food.
26 And we said, We cannot go
down: if our youngest brother be
with us, then will we go down: for
we may not see the man’s face, except our a youngest brother be with
us.
27 And thy servant my father said
unto us, Ye know that my wife bare

me, and I said, Surely he is a torn
in b pieces; and I saw him not since:
29 And if ye a take this also from
me, and mischief befall b him, ye
shall bring down my gray hairs with
sorrow to the grave.
30 Now therefore when I come to
thy servant my father, and the lad
be not with us; seeing that his life
is a bound up in the lad’s life;

seeth that the lad is not with us, that
he will die: and thy servants shall
bring down the gray hairs of thy

for the lad unto my father, saying,
If I bring him not unto thee, then I
shall bear the a blame to my father
for ever.

stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his

And they came near. And he said,
I am a Joseph your brother, whom
ye sold into Egypt.
5 Now therefore be not a grieved,
nor angry with yourselves, that ye
sold me hither: for God did b send
me before you to preserve life.

are five years, in the which there
shall neither be earing nor harvest.

land of a Goshen, and thou shalt be

and thy flocks, and thy herds, and

lade your beasts, and go, get you
unto the land of Canaan;
18 And take your father and your
households, and come unto me: and
I will give you the good of the land
of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat
of the land.
19 Now thou art commanded, this
do ye; take you a wagons out of the
land of Egypt for your little ones,
and for your wives, and bring your
father, and come.
20 Also regard not your stuff; for

the good of all the land of Egypt
is yours.
21 And the children of Israel did
so: and Joseph gave them wagons,
according to the commandment of
Pharaoh, and gave them provision
for the way.
22 To all of them he gave each man
changes of raiment; but to a Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of
silver, and five changes of raiment.
23 And to his father he sent after
this manner; ten asses laden with
the good things of Egypt, and ten
she asses laden with corn and bread
and meat for his father by the way.
24 So he sent his brethren away,
and they departed: and he said unto
them, See that ye fall not out by
the way.
25 ¶ And they went up out of
Egypt, and came into the land of
Canaan unto Jacob their father,
26 And told him, saying, Joseph
is yet alive, and he is a governor over
all the land of Egypt. And Jacob’s
heart fainted, for he believed them
not.
27 And they told him all the words
of Joseph, which he had said unto
them: and when he saw the a wagons which Joseph had sent to carry
him, the spirit of Jacob their father
b 
revived:
28 And Israel said, It is enough;
Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go
and see him before I die.
Chapter 46
The Lord sends Jacob and his family of
seventy souls to Egypt—The descendants
of Jacob are named—Joseph meets Jacob.
And Israel took his journey with
all that he had, and came to a Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto
the God of his father Isaac.
2 And God spake unto Israel in the
a 
visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.

3 And he said, I am God, the God
of thy a father: fear not to go down
into b Egypt; for I will there make
of thee a great c nation:
4 a I will go down with thee into
Egypt; and I will also surely b bring
thee up again: and c Joseph shall put
his hand upon thine eyes.
5 And Jacob a rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their
little ones, and their wives, in the
b 
wagons which Pharaoh had sent
to carry him.
6 And they took their cattle, and
their goods, which they had gotten
in the land of Canaan, and came
into a Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed
with him:
7 His sons, and his sons’ sons with
him, his daughters, and his sons’
daughters, and all his a seed brought
he with him into Egypt.
8 ¶ And these are the a names of the

were born him in Egypt, were two

Jacob, which came into Egypt, were

28 ¶ And he sent Judah before

unto Goshen; and they came into

his father, to Goshen, and presented

30 And Israel said unto Joseph,
Now let me die, since I have seen

31 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father’s house, I
will go up, and shew a Pharaoh, and
say unto him, My brethren, and my
father’s house, which were in the
land of Canaan, are come unto me;
32 And the men are shepherds,
for their trade hath been to feed
cattle; and they have brought their
flocks, and their herds, and all that
they have.
33 And it shall come to pass, when
Pharaoh shall call you, and shall
say, What is your a occupation?
34 That ye shall say, Thy servants’
trade hath been about a cattle from
our youth even until now, both we,
and also our fathers: that ye may
dwell in the land of Goshen; for

unto the Egyptians.

Then Joseph came and told a Pharaoh, and said, My father and my
brethren, and their flocks, and their
herds, and all that they have, are
come out of the land of Canaan;
and, behold, they are in the land
of b Goshen.
2 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented
them unto a Pharaoh.
3 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your a occupation? And
they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are b shepherds, both we, and
also our fathers.
4 They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to a sojourn in the land
are we come; for thy servants have
no pasture for their flocks; for the
famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee,
let thy servants dwell in the land
of Goshen.
5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph,
saying, Thy father and thy brethren
are come unto thee:
6 The land of a Egypt is before
thee; in the best of the land make
thy father and brethren to dwell; in
the land of Goshen let them dwell:
and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them
rulers over my cattle.
7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his
father, and set him before Pharaoh:
and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob,
How old art thou?
9 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh,
The days of the years of my a pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty
years: few and b evil have the days of
the years of my life been, and have
not attained unto the c days of the
years of the life of my fathers in

10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh,
and went out from before Pharaoh.
11 ¶ And Joseph placed his father
and his brethren, and gave them
a possession in the land of Egypt,
in the best of the land, in the land
of a Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
12 And Joseph a  nourished his
father, and his brethren, and all
his father’s household, with bread,
according to their families.
13 ¶ And there was no bread in all
the land; for the a famine was very
sore, so that the land of Egypt and
all the land of Canaan fainted by
reason of the famine.
14 And Joseph gathered up all
the a money that was found in the
land of Egypt, and in the land of
Canaan, for the corn which they
bought: and Joseph brought the
money into Pharaoh’s house.
15 And when money failed in the
land of Egypt, and in the land of
Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto
Joseph, and said, Give us a bread: for
why should we die in thy presence?
for the money faileth.
16 And Joseph said, Give your
cattle; and I will give you for your
cattle, if money fail.
17 And they brought their cattle
unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them
bread in exchange for horses, and for
the flocks, and for the cattle of the
herds, and for the asses: and he fed
them with bread for all their cattle
for that year.
18 When that year was ended, they
came unto him the second year, and
said unto him, We will not hide it
from my lord, how that our money
is spent; my lord also hath our herds
of cattle; there is not ought left in
the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:
19 Wherefore shall we die before
thine eyes, both we and our land?
buy us and our land for bread, and

we and our land will be servants
unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that
we may live, and not die, that the
land be not desolate.
20 And Joseph bought all the
land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for
the Egyptians sold every man his
field, because the famine prevailed
over them: so the land became
Pharaoh’s.
21 And as for the people, a he removed them to cities from one end
of the borders of Egypt even to the
other end thereof.
22 Only the land of the a priests
bought he not; for the priests had
a portion assigned them of Pharaoh,
and did eat their portion which
Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they
sold not their lands.
23 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this
day and your land for Pharaoh: lo,
here is seed for you, and ye shall
sow the land.
24 And it shall come to pass a in
the increase, that ye shall give the
b 
fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four
parts shall be your own, for seed of
the field, and for your food, and for
them of your households, and for
food for your little ones.
25 And they said, Thou hast saved
our lives: let us find grace in the
sight of my lord, and we will be
Pharaoh’s servants.
26 And Joseph made it a law over
the land of Egypt unto this day, that
Pharaoh should have the fifth part;
except the land of the a priests only,
which became not Pharaoh’s.
27 ¶ And Israel dwelt in the land
of Egypt, in the country of Goshen;
and they had possessions therein,
and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.

29 And the a time drew nigh that
Israel must die: and he called his
son Joseph, and said unto him, If
now I have found grace in thy sight,
put, I pray thee, thy hand under my
b 
thigh, and deal kindly and truly
with me; c bury me not, I pray thee,
in Egypt:
30 But I will lie with my fathers,
and thou shalt carry me out of
Egypt, and a bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as
thou hast said.

And it came to pass after these
things, that one told Joseph, Behold,
thy father is sick: and he took with
him his two sons, Manasseh and
Ephraim.
2 And one told a Jacob, and said,
Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto
thee: and Israel b strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.

were born unto thee in the land

shall be called after the name of

7 And as for me, when I came
from Padan, a Rachel died by me
in the land of Canaan in the way,
when yet there was but a little way
to come unto Ephrath: and I buried
her there in the way of Ephrath;
the same is Beth-lehem.
8 And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons,
and said, Who are these?
9 And Joseph said unto his father,
They are my sons, whom God hath
given me in this place. And he said,
Bring them, I pray thee, unto me,
and I will a bless them.
10 Now the eyes of Israel were
a 
dim for age, so that he could not
see. And he brought them b near
unto him; and he kissed them, and
embraced them.
11 And Israel said unto Joseph,
I had not thought to see thy face:
and, lo, God hath shewed me also
thy seed.
12 And Joseph brought them out
from between his knees, and he
bowed himself with his face to
the earth.
13 And Joseph took them both,
Ephraim in his right hand toward
Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in
his left hand toward Israel’s right
hand, and brought them near unto

14 And Israel stretched out his right
hand, and laid it upon a Ephraim’s
head, who was the younger, and his
left hand upon Manasseh’s head,
b 
guiding his hands wittingly; for
Manasseh was the firstborn.
15 ¶ And he blessed a Joseph, and
said, God, before whom my fathers
Abraham and Isaac did b walk, the
God which c fed me all my life long
unto this day,

from all evil, bless the lads; and let

father laid his right a hand upon the
head of b Ephraim, c it displeased
him: and he held up his father’s
hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s
head unto Manasseh’s head.
18 And Joseph said unto his father,
Not so, my father: for this is the
firstborn; put thy right hand upon
his head.
19 And his father refused, and
said, I know it, my son, I know it:
he also shall become a people, and
he also shall be a great: but truly his

than he, and his b seed shall become

6 O my soul, come not thou into
their secret; unto their assembly,
mine honour, be not thou a united:
for in their b anger they c slew a man,
and in their selfwill they digged
down a wall.
7 a Cursed be their b anger, for it was
fierce; and their wrath, for it was
c 
cruel: I will divide them in Jacob,
and scatter them in Israel.
8 ¶ a Judah, thou art he whom thy
brethren shall b praise: thy hand
shall be in the c neck of thine enemies; thy father’s children shall
d 
bow down before thee.
9 Judah is a a lion’s whelp: from
the prey, my son, thou art gone up:
he stooped down, he couched as a
b 
lion, and as an old lion; who shall
rouse him up?
10 The sceptre shall not depart
from a Judah, nor a b lawgiver from
between his feet, until c Shiloh come;
and unto him shall the d gathering
of the people be.
11 Binding his foal unto the vine,
and his ass’s colt unto the choice
a 
vine; he b washed his garments in
wine, and his clothes in the c blood
of grapes:

and his teeth white with milk.

25 Even by the God of thy father,
who shall help thee; and by the a Almighty, who shall bless thee with
blessings of heaven above, blessings
of the deep that lieth under, blessings
of the breasts, and of the b womb:
26 The a blessings of thy father have
prevailed above the blessings of my

28 ¶ All these are the a  twelve
tribes of Israel: and this is it that
their father spake unto them, and
b 
blessed them; every one according
to his c blessing he blessed them.
29 And he charged them, and said
unto them, I am to be gathered
unto my a people: b bury me with
my fathers in the cave that is in the
field of Ephron the Hittite,
30 In the cave that is in the field of
a 
Machpelah, which is before Mamre,
in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of b Ephron the Hittite for a possession of
a buryingplace.
31 There they a buried Abraham
and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and
there I buried Leah.

of the cave that is therein was from

Jacob’s body is embalmed—Joseph
buries him in Canaan—Joseph comforts his brothers—The children of
Israel multiply—Joseph promises that
God will bring Israel out of Egypt into
Canaan—Joseph dies in Egypt and is
embalmed.
And a Joseph fell upon his father’s

kissed him.
2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to a embalm
his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
3 And forty days were fulfilled for
him; for so are fulfilled the days of
those which are embalmed: and the
Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.
4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto
the house of Pharaoh, saying, If
now I have found grace in your
eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears
of Pharaoh, saying,
5 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my a grave which I
have digged for me in the land of
Canaan, there shalt thou bury me.
Now therefore let me go up, I pray
thee, and bury my father, and I will
come again.
6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and
bury thy father, according as he
made thee swear.

7 ¶ And Joseph went up to bury
his father: and with him went up
all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders
of the land of Egypt,
8 And all the house of Joseph,
and his brethren, and his father’s
house: only their little ones, and
their flocks, and their herds, they
left in the land of a Goshen.
9 And there went up with him
both chariots and horsemen: and
it was a very great company.
10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond
Jordan, and there they a mourned
with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a b mourning
for his father seven days.
11 And when the inhabitants of
the land, the Canaanites, saw the
mourning in the floor of Atad, they
said, This is a grievous mourning to
the Egyptians: wherefore the name
of it was called a Abel-mizraim,
which is beyond Jordan.
12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:
13 For his sons a carried him into the
land of Canaan, and buried him in
the cave of the field of Machpelah,
which Abraham bought with the field
for a possession of a b buryingplace of
c 
Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
14 ¶ And Joseph returned into
Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all
that went up with him to bury his
father, after he had buried his father.
15 ¶ And when Joseph’s brethren
saw that their father was dead, they
said, a Joseph will peradventure hate
us, and will certainly requite us all
the evil which we did unto him.
16 And they sent a messenger unto

or  If Joseph bears a

will certainly repay
us . . .

Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,
17 So shall ye say unto Joseph, a Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass
of thy brethren, and their sin; for
they did unto thee evil: and now,
we pray thee, forgive the trespass
of the servants of the God of thy
father. And Joseph b wept when they
spake unto him.
18 And his brethren also went and
fell down before his face; and they
said, Behold, we be thy a servants.
19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear
not: for am I in the place of God?
20 But as for you, ye thought a evil
against me; but God b meant it unto
c 
good, to bring to pass, as it is this
day, to save much people alive.
21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will
a 
nourish you, and your little ones.
And he comforted them, and spake
kindly unto them.
22 ¶ And a Joseph dwelt in Egypt,
he, and his father’s house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.
23 And Joseph saw Ephraim’s
a 
children of the third generation: the
children also of Machir the son of
b 
Manasseh were brought up upon
Joseph’s knees.
24 a And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit
you, and b bring you out of this land
unto the c land which he sware to
d 
Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
25 And Joseph took an a oath of the
children of Israel, saying, God will
surely visit you, and ye shall carry
up my b bones from hence.
26 So a Joseph b died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they
c 
embalmed him, and he was put in
a coffin in Egypt.

The Second Book of Moses
Called

Exodus
Chapter 1
The children of Israel multiply—They
are placed in bondage by the Egyp­
tians—Pharaoh seeks to destroy the
sons born to Hebrew women.
ow these are the a names of
the b children of Israel, which
came c into d Egypt; every man
and his household came with Jacob.
2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
4 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and
Asher.
5 And all the souls that came out
of the loins of a Jacob were seventy
souls: for Joseph was in Egypt al­
ready.
6 And a Joseph died, and all his
brethren, and all that generation.
7 ¶ And the children of Israel
were a fruitful, and b increased abundantly, and multiplied, and c waxed
exceeding mighty; and the land was
filled with them.
8 Now there arose up a new a king
over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.
9 And he said unto his people,
Behold, the people of the children
of Israel are a more and b mightier
than we:

10 Come on, let us deal a wisely
with them; lest they multiply, and it
come to pass, that, when there b falleth out any war, they join also unto
our enemies, and fight against us,
and so get them up out of the land.
11 Therefore they did set over
them a taskmasters to afflict them
with their b burdens. And they built
for Pharaoh c treasure cities, Pithom
and d Raamses.
12 But the more they afflicted
them, the more they a multiplied
and grew. And they were b grieved
because of the children of Israel.
13 And the Egyptians made the
children of Israel to serve with
rigour:
14 And they made their lives bitter with hard a bondage, in mortar,
and in brick, and in all manner of
service in the field: all their service,
wherein they made them serve, was
with rigour.
15 ¶ And the king of Egypt spake
to the Hebrew midwives, of which
the name of the one was Shiphrah,
and the name of the other Puah:
16 And he said, When ye a do the

kill him: but if it be a daughter, then
she shall live.
17 But the midwives a feared God,
and did not as the king of Egypt
b 
commanded them, but saved the
men children alive.
18 And the king of Egypt called for
the midwives, and said unto them,
Why have ye done this thing, and
have saved the men children alive?
19 And the midwives said unto
Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew
women are not as the Egyptian
women; for they are lively, and are
a 
delivered ere the midwives come
in unto them.
20 Therefore God dealt a well with
the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.
21 And it came to pass, because
the midwives a feared God, that he
made them b houses.
22 And Pharaoh charged all his
people, saying, Every son that is
a 
born ye shall cast into the river, and
every daughter ye shall save alive.

Chapter 2
Moses is born to Levite parents, is raised
by Pharaoh’s daughter, slays an Egyptian in defense of an Israelite, flees to
Midian, and marries Zipporah—Israel

And there went a man of the house
of a Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.
2 And the woman conceived, and
bare a a son: and when she saw him
that he was a goodly child, she hid
him b three months.

hide him, she took for him an ark

flags by the river’s brink.
4 And his a sister stood afar off,
b 
to wit what would be done to him.
5 ¶ And the daughter of Pharaoh
came down to wash herself at the
river; and her maidens walked along
by the river’s side; and when she
saw the ark among the flags, she
sent her maid to fetch it.
6 And when she had opened it,
she saw the child: and, behold, the
babe wept. And she had compassion
on him, and said, This is one of the
Hebrews’ children.
7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s
daughter, Shall I go and call to thee
a nurse of the Hebrew women, that
she may nurse the child for thee?
8 And Pharaoh’s daughter said to
her, Go. And the maid went and
called the child’s mother.
9 And Pharaoh’s daughter said
unto her, Take this child away, and
nurse it for me, and I will give thee
thy wages. And the woman took the
child, and nursed it.
10 And the child grew, and she
brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her a son. And
she called his name b Moses: and she
said, Because I drew him out of
the water.
11 ¶ And it came to pass in those
days, when Moses was grown, that
he went out unto his a brethren,
and looked on their b burdens: and
he spied an Egyptian smiting an
Hebrew, one of his brethren.
12 And he looked this way and
that way, and when he saw that there
was no man, he a slew the Egyptian,
and hid him in the sand.
13 And when he went out the

said to him that did the wrong,
Wherefore a smitest thou thy fellow?
14 And he said, Who made thee a
a 
prince and a judge over us? intend­
est thou to kill me, as thou killedst
the Egyptian? And Moses feared,
and said, Surely this thing is known.
15 Now when Pharaoh heard this
thing, he sought to a slay Moses.
But Moses b fled from c the face of
Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of
Midian: and he sat down by a well.
16 Now the priest of a Midian had
seven daughters: and they came and
drew b water, and filled the troughs
to water their father’s flock.
17 And the shepherds came and
drove them away: but Moses stood
up and helped them, and watered
their flock.
18 And when they came to a Reuel
their father, he said, How is it that
ye are come so soon to day ?
19 And they said, An Egyptian
delivered us out of the hand of
the shepherds, and also drew water
enough for us, and watered the flock.
20 And he said unto his daughters,
And where is he? why is it that ye
have left the man? call him, that
he may eat bread.
21 And Moses was content to dwell
with the man: and he gave Moses

Zipporah his daughter.

The Lord appears to Moses at the burning bush—Moses is called to deliver
Israel from bondage—The Lord identifies Himself as the God of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, and as the Great
I Am—He promises to smite Egypt
and bring His people out with great
wealth.
Now Moses kept the flock of a Jethro
his father in law, the b priest of
Midian: and he led the flock to the
backside of the desert, and came
to the c mountain of God, even to
d 
Horeb.
2 And the a angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of b fire
out of the midst of a c bush: and
he looked, and, behold, the bush
burned with fire, and the bush was
not consumed.
3 And Moses said, I will now turn
aside, and see this great sight, why
the bush is not burnt.
4 And when the Lord saw that he
turned aside to see, God a called unto
him out of the midst of the bush,

Here am I.
5 And he said, Draw not nigh
hither: put off thy a shoes from off
thy feet, for the place whereon thou
standest is b holy ground.
6 Moreover he said, a I am the b God
of thy father, the God of Abraham,

he was c afraid to d look upon God.
7 ¶ And the Lord said, I have
surely seen the a affliction of my
people which are in b Egypt, and
have heard their c cry by reason of
their taskmasters; for I know their
sorrows;
8 And I am come a down to b deliver
them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of
that land unto a good land and a
large, unto a land c flowing with
milk and honey; unto the place of
the d Canaanites, and the Hittites,
and the Amorites, and the Perizzites,
and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.

of the children of Israel is come
unto me: and I have also seen the

up out of the a affliction of b Egypt
unto the land of the c Canaanites, and

the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and
the d Jebusites, unto a e land flowing

18 And they shall a hearken to thy
voice: and thou shalt come, thou and
the elders of Israel, unto the king of
Egypt, and ye shall say unto him,
The Lord b God of the Hebrews hath
met with us: and now c let us go, we
beseech thee, three days’ journey
into the wilderness, that we may
d 
sacrifice to the Lord our God.
19 ¶ And a I am sure that the king
of Egypt will not let you go, b no,
not by a c mighty hand.
20 And I will stretch out my hand,
and smite Egypt with all my a wonders which I will do in the midst
thereof: and after that he will let
you b go.
21 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians:
and it shall come to pass, that, when
ye go, ye shall not go a empty:
22 But every woman shall a borrow
of her neighbour, and of her that
sojourneth in her house, jewels of
silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon
your sons, and upon your daughters;
and ye shall b spoil the Egyptians.

And Moses answered and said, But,
behold, they will not a believe me,
nor b hearken unto my voice: for
they will say, The Lord hath not
appeared unto thee.
2 And the Lord said unto him,
What is that in thine hand? And
he said, A rod.
3 And he said, Cast it on the
ground. And he cast it on the
ground, and it became a serpent;
and Moses fled from before it.
4 And the Lord said unto Moses,
Put forth thine hand, and take it by
the tail. And he put forth his hand,
and caught it, and it became a rod
in his hand:
5 That they may believe that the
Lord God of their fathers, the God
of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and

plucked it out of his bosom, and,

O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither
heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow
of a speech, and of a b slow tongue.

in Midian, Go, return into Egypt:

sought thy b life.
20 And Moses took his wife and

Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in
the a mount of God, and kissed him.
28 And Moses told Aaron all the
words of the Lord who had sent
him, and all the signs which he had

29 ¶ And Moses and Aaron went
and gathered together all the a elders of the children of Israel:
30 And Aaron a spake all the words
which the Lord had spoken unto
Moses, and did the signs in the sight
of the people.
31 And the people a believed: and
when they heard that the Lord
had b visited the children of Israel,
and that he had looked upon their

Moses and Aaron ask Pharaoh to free

And afterward Moses and Aaron
went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus

my people b go, that they may hold
a c feast unto me in the wilderness.
2 And Pharaoh said, Who is the
Lord, that I should a obey his voice to
let Israel go? I b know not the Lord,
neither will I let Israel go.

4 And the king of Egypt said unto
them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and
Aaron, a let the people from their
works? get you unto your b burdens.
5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the
people of the land now are a many,
and ye make them rest from their
burdens.
6 And Pharaoh commanded the
same day the taskmasters of the
people, and their officers, saying,
7 Ye shall no more give the people
straw to make brick, as heretofore:
let them go and gather straw for
themselves.
8 And the a tale of the bricks, which
they did make heretofore, ye shall
lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle;
therefore they cry, saying, Let us
go and sacrifice to our God.
9 Let there more work be laid
upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.
10 ¶ And the taskmasters of the
people went out, and their officers,
and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not
give you straw.
11 Go ye, get you straw where ye
can find it: yet a not ought of your
work shall be diminished.
12 So the people were scattered
abroad throughout all the land of
Egypt to gather stubble instead of
straw.
13 And the taskmasters a hasted
them, saying, Fulfil your works, your
daily tasks, as when there was straw.

of Israel, which Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were

have ye not fulfilled your task in
making brick both yesterday and
to day, as heretofore?
15 ¶ Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto
Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest
thou thus with thy servants?
16 There is no straw given unto
thy servants, and they say to us,
Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in
thine own people.
17 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are
idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and
do sacrifice to the Lord.
18 Go therefore now, and work;
for there shall no straw be given
you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of
bricks.
19 And the officers of the children
of Israel did see that they a were in
evil case, after it was said, Ye shall
not minish ought from your bricks
of your daily task.
20 ¶ And they met Moses and
Aaron, who stood in the way, as
they came forth from Pharaoh:
21 And they said unto them, The
Lord look upon you, and judge;
because ye have made a our savour
to be b abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants,
to put a sword in their hand to
slay us.
22 And Moses a returned unto the
Lord, and said, Lord, wherefore
hast thou so b evil entreated this
people? why is it that thou hast sent
me?

speak in thy name, he hath done
evil to this people; neither hast thou
delivered thy people at all.

9 ¶ And Moses spake so unto the

of spirit, and for a cruel bondage.
10 And the Lord spake unto
Moses, saying,
11 Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king
of Egypt, that he let the children
of Israel go out of his land.
12 And Moses spake before the
Lord, saying, Behold, the children
of Israel have not hearkened unto
me; how then shall Pharaoh hear
me, who am a of uncircumcised lips?
13 And the Lord spake unto Moses

and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to
bring the children of Israel out of

Chapter 7
Moses is appointed to give the word of the
Lord to Pharaoh—The Lord will multiply
signs and wonders in Egypt—Aaron’s rod
becomes a serpent—The river is turned
into blood—The magicians imitate the
miracles of Moses and Aaron.
And the Lord said unto Moses, See,
I have made thee a a b god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall
be thy c prophet.
2 Thou shalt speak all that I a command thee: and Aaron thy brother
shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he
send the children of Israel out of
his land.
3 a And I will harden Pharaoh’s
heart, and multiply my signs and
my b wonders in the land of Egypt.
4 a But Pharaoh shall not hearken
unto you, that I may lay my hand
upon Egypt, and bring forth mine
b 
armies, and my people the children
of Israel, out of the land of Egypt
by great judgments.
5 And the Egyptians shall a know
that b I am the c Lord, when I stretch
forth mine hand upon Egypt, and
bring out the children of Israel from
among them.
6 And Moses and Aaron did as the
Lord commanded them, so did they.
7 And Moses was a fourscore years
old, and b Aaron fourscore and three
years old, when they spake unto
Pharaoh.
8 ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

Aaron cast down his rod before
Pharaoh, and before his servants,
and it became a serpent.
11 Then Pharaoh also called the
wise men and the a sorcerers: now
the b magicians of Egypt, they also
did in like manner with their enchantments.
12 For they cast down every man
his rod, and they became serpents:
but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their
rods.
13 a And he hardened Pharaoh’s
heart, that he hearkened not unto
them; as the Lord had said.
14 ¶ And the Lord said unto
Moses, Pharaoh’s heart is hardened,
he refuseth to let the people go.
15 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the
morning; lo, he goeth out unto
the water; and thou shalt stand by
the river’s brink a against he come;

a serpent shalt thou take in thine

18 And the fish that is in the river
shall die, and the river shall stink;
and the Egyptians shall lothe to
drink of the water of the river.
19 ¶ And the Lord spake unto
Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy
rod, and stretch out thine hand
upon the waters of Egypt, upon
their streams, upon their rivers,
and upon their ponds, and upon all
their pools of water, that they may
become a blood; and that there may
be blood throughout all the land of
Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and
in vessels of stone.
20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as
the Lord commanded; and he lifted
up the a rod, and smote the waters
that were in the river, in the sight of
Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were
in the river were turned to b blood.
21 And the fish that was in the river
died; and the river stank, and the
Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood
throughout all the land of Egypt.
22 And the magicians of Egypt
did so with their enchantments:
and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened,
neither did he hearken unto them;
as the Lord had said.
23 And Pharaoh turned and went
into his house, a neither did he set
his heart to this also.
24 And all the Egyptians digged
round about the river for water to
drink; for they could not drink of
the water of the river.
25 And seven days were fulfilled,
after that the Lord had smitten
the river.

go, that they may a serve me.
2 And if thou refuse to let them go,
behold, I will smite a all thy borders
with b frogs:
3 And the river shall bring forth
frogs abundantly, which shall go up
and come into thine house, and into
thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed,
and into the house of thy servants,

4 And the frogs shall come up both

up upon the land of Egypt.
6 And Aaron stretched out his
hand over the waters of Egypt; and

up frogs upon the land of Egypt.
8 ¶ Then Pharaoh called for Moses
and Aaron, and said, Entreat the
Lord, that he may take away the
frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that
they may do sacrifice unto the Lord.
9 And Moses said unto Pharaoh,

Glory over me: when shall I entreat
for thee, and for thy servants, and
for thy people, to destroy the frogs
from thee and thy houses, that they
may remain in the river only ?

he said, Be it according to thy word:

12 And Moses and Aaron went out
from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto
the Lord because of the frogs which
he had brought against Pharaoh.
13 And the Lord did according to
the word of Moses; and the frogs
died out of the houses, out of the
villages, and out of the fields.
14 And they gathered them together
upon heaps: and the land stank.
15 But when Pharaoh saw that
there was respite, he a hardened
his heart, and hearkened not unto
them; as the Lord had said.
16 ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy
rod, and smite the dust of the land,
that it may become a lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
17 And they did so; for Aaron
stretched out his hand with his rod,
and smote the dust of the earth, and
it became lice in man, and in beast;
all the dust of the land became a lice
throughout all the land of Egypt.
18 And the magicians did so with
their enchantments to a bring forth
lice, but they could not: so there
were lice upon man, and upon beast.
19 Then the magicians said unto
Pharaoh, This is the a finger of God:
and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened,
and he hearkened not unto them;
as the Lord had said.
20 ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning,
and stand before Pharaoh; a lo, he
cometh forth to the water; and say
unto him, Thus saith the Lord,
Let my people go, that they may
serve me.
21 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms
of a flies upon thee, and upon thy
servants, and upon thy people, and
into thy houses: and the houses
of the Egyptians shall be full of

flies shall be there; to the end thou
mayest know that I am the Lord in
the midst of the earth.
23 And I will put a division between my people and thy people:
to morrow shall this sign be.
24 And the Lord did so; and there
came a grievous swarm of flies into
the house of Pharaoh, and into his
servants’ houses, and into all the land
of Egypt: the land was a corrupted
by reason of the swarm of flies.
25 ¶ And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,
sacrifice to your God in the land.
26 And Moses said, It a is not meet
so to do; for we shall sacrifice b the
abomination of the Egyptians to the
Lord our God: lo, shall we sacrifice
the abomination of the Egyptians
before their eyes, and will they not
stone us?
27 We will go three days’ journey
into the wilderness, and sacrifice
to the Lord our God, as he shall
command us.
28 And Pharaoh said, I will let
you go, that ye may sacrifice to the
Lord your God in the wilderness;
only ye shall not go very far away:
entreat for me.
29 And Moses said, Behold, I go
out from thee, and I will entreat
the Lord that the swarms of flies
may depart from Pharaoh, from
his servants, and from his people,
to morrow: but let not Pharaoh
deal deceitfully any more in not
letting the people go to sacrifice
to the Lord.

Chapter 9
The Lord destroys the cattle of the
Egyptians, but not of the Israelites—
Boils and blains are sent upon the
Egyptians—The Lord sends hail and
fire upon the people of Pharaoh, but not
upon the people of Israel.
Then the Lord said unto Moses,
Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him,
Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they
may serve me.
2 For if thou refuse to let them go,
and wilt hold them still,
3 Behold, the hand of the Lord is
upon thy cattle which is in the field,
upon the horses, upon the asses,
upon the camels, upon the oxen,
and upon the sheep: there shall be a
very a grievous b murrain.
4 And the Lord shall a sever between the cattle of Israel and the
cattle of Egypt: and there shall
nothing die of all that is the children’s of Israel.
5 And the Lord appointed a set
time, saying, To morrow the Lord
shall do this thing in the land.
6 And the Lord did that thing
on the morrow, and all the cattle
of Egypt died: but of the cattle of
the children of Israel died not one.
7 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold,
there was not one of the cattle of
the Israelites dead. And the heart
of Pharaoh was hardened, and he
did not let the people go.

and Moses sprinkled it up toward
heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and
upon beast.
11 And the magicians could not
stand before Moses because of the
boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.
12 a And the Lord hardened the
heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened
not unto them; as the Lord had
spoken unto Moses.
13 ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning,
and stand before Pharaoh, and say
unto him, Thus saith the Lord God
of the Hebrews, Let my people go,
that they may serve me.
14 For I will at this time send
all my a plagues upon thine heart,

19 Send therefore now, and gather
thy cattle, and all that thou hast
in the field; for upon every man
and beast which shall be found in
the field, and shall not be brought
home, the hail shall come down
upon them, and they shall die.
20 He that feared the word of the
Lord among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:
21 And he that regarded not the
word of the Lord left his servants
and his cattle in the field.
22 ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward
heaven, that there may be hail in
all the land of Egypt, upon man,
and upon beast, and upon every
herb of the field, throughout the
land of Egypt.
23 And Moses stretched forth his
rod toward heaven: and the Lord
sent thunder and a hail, and the
fire ran along upon the ground;
and the Lord rained hail upon the
land of Egypt.
24 So there was hail, and a fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,
such as there was none like it in all
the land of Egypt since it became
a nation.
25 And the a hail smote throughout
all the land of Egypt all that was in
the field, both man and beast; and
the hail smote every herb of the field,
and brake every tree of the field.
26 Only in the land of Goshen,
where the children of Israel were,
was there no hail.
27 ¶ And Pharaoh sent, and called
for Moses and Aaron, and said unto
them, I have sinned this time: the
Lord is righteous, and I and my
people are wicked.

that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you
go, and ye shall stay no longer.
29 And Moses said unto him, As
soon as I am gone out of the city, I
will a spread abroad my hands unto
the Lord; and the thunder shall
cease, neither shall there be any
more hail; that thou mayest know
how that the b earth is the c Lord’s.
30 But as for thee and thy servants,
I know that ye will not yet fear the
Lord God.

was smitten: for the barley was in

32 But the a wheat and the b rie

33 And Moses went out of the city
from Pharaoh, and spread abroad
his hands unto the Lord: and the
thunders and hail ceased, and the
rain was not poured upon the earth.
34 And when Pharaoh saw that the
rain and the hail and the thunders
were ceased, he sinned yet more,
and hardened his heart, he and his
servants.
35 And the heart of Pharaoh was
hardened, neither would he let the
children of Israel go; as the Lord
had spoken by Moses.

Egypt, and my signs which I have
done among them; that ye may know
how that I am the Lord.
3 And Moses and Aaron came in
unto Pharaoh, and said unto him,
Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to
a 
humble thyself before me? let my
people go, that they may serve me.
4 Else, if thou refuse to let my
people go, behold, to morrow will
I bring the a locusts into thy coast:
5 And they shall cover the face of
the earth, that one cannot be able
to see the earth: and they shall eat
the a residue of that which is escaped,
which remaineth unto you from the
hail, and shall eat every tree which
groweth for you out of the field:
6 And they shall fill thy houses,
and the houses of all thy servants,
and the houses of all the Egyptians;
which neither thy fathers, nor thy
fathers’ fathers have seen, since the
day that they were upon the earth
unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.
7 And Pharaoh’s servants said unto
him, How long shall this man be a
a 
snare unto us? let the men go, that
they may serve the Lord their God:
knowest thou not yet that Egypt is
b 
destroyed?
8 And Moses and Aaron were brought
again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto
them, Go, serve the Lord your God:
but who are they that shall go?
9 And Moses said, We will go with
our young and with our a old, with
our sons and with our daughters,
with our flocks and with our herds
will we go; for we must hold a b feast
unto the Lord.
10 And he said unto them, Let the
Lord be so with you, a as I will let
you go, and your little ones: look
to it; for b evil is before you.

and serve the Lord; for that ye did
desire. And they were driven out
from Pharaoh’s presence.
12 ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the
land of Egypt for the locusts, that
they may come up upon the land
of Egypt, and eat every herb of the
land, even all that the hail hath left.
13 And Moses stretched forth his
rod over the land of Egypt, and the
Lord brought an east wind upon
the land all that day, and all that
night; and when it was morning,
the east wind brought the locusts.
14 And the a locusts went up over
all the land of Egypt, and rested b in
all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous
were they; before them there were
no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.
15 For they covered the face of the
whole earth, so that the land was
darkened; and they did eat every
herb of the land, and all the fruit of
the trees which the hail had left: and
there remained not any green thing
in the trees, or in the herbs of the
field, through all the land of Egypt.
16 ¶ Then Pharaoh called for Moses
and Aaron in haste; and he said, I
have sinned against the Lord your
God, and against you.
17 Now therefore forgive, I pray
thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the Lord your God, that he may
take away from me this death only.
18 And he went out from Pharaoh,
and entreated the Lord.
19 And the Lord turned a mighty
strong west wind, which took away
the locusts, and cast them into the
a 
Red sea; there remained not one
locust in all the coasts of Egypt.
20 a But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that he would not
let the children of Israel go.

22 And Moses stretched forth his
hand toward heaven; and there was
a thick a darkness in all the land of
Egypt three days:
23 They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for
three days: but all the children of
Israel had light in their dwellings.
24 ¶ And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the Lord;
only let your flocks and your herds
a 
be stayed: let your little ones also
go with you.
25 And Moses said, Thou must
a 
give us also sacrifices and burnt
offerings, that we may sacrifice
unto the Lord our God.
26 Our cattle also shall go with
us; there shall not an hoof be left
behind; for thereof must we take
to serve the Lord our God; and we
know not with what we must serve
the Lord, until we come thither.
27 ¶ a But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let
them go.

thou seest my face thou shalt die.

no more.

Moreover the man Moses was very
great in the land of Egypt, in the
sight of Pharaoh’s servants, and in
the sight of the people.
4 And Moses said, Thus saith the
Lord, About midnight will I go out
into the midst of Egypt:
5 And all the a firstborn in the land
of Egypt shall die, from the b firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon
his throne, even unto the firstborn of
the maidservant that is behind the
mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.
6 And there shall be a great cry
throughout all the land of Egypt,
such as there was none like it, nor
shall be like it any more.

of Israel shall not a dog move his

doth put a a difference between the

And he went out from Pharaoh in

so that he would not let the children
of Israel go out of his land.
Chapter 12
The Lord institutes the Passover and
the Feast of Unleavened Bread—Lambs
without blemish are slain—Israel is
saved by their blood—The firstborn of
all Egyptians are slain—Israel is thrust
out of Egypt after 430 years—No bones
of the paschal lambs are to be broken.
And the Lord spake unto Moses and
Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,
2 This a month shall be unto you
the b beginning of months: it shall be
the first month of the year to you.
3 ¶ Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth
day of this month they shall take to
them every man a lamb, according
to the house of their fathers, a lamb
for an house:
4 And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his
neighbour next unto his house take
it according to the number of the
souls; every man according to his
a 
eating shall make your count for
the lamb.
5 Your a lamb shall be without
blemish, a male b of the first year:
ye shall take it out from the sheep,
or from the goats:
6 And ye shall keep it up until
the a fourteenth day of the same
month: and the whole assembly of
the congregation of Israel shall kill
it in the evening.
7 And they shall take of the blood,
and strike it on the two side posts
and on the upper door post of the
houses, wherein they shall eat it.

10 And ye shall let nothing of it

morning ye shall burn with fire.
11 ¶ And thus shall ye eat it; with
your loins a girded, your shoes on
your feet, and your staff in your
hand; and ye shall eat it in b haste:
it is the Lord’s passover.
12 For I will pass through the
land of Egypt this night, and will
smite all the a firstborn in the land
of Egypt, both man and beast; and

17 And ye shall observe the a feast

selfsame day have I brought your
c 
armies out of the land of Egypt:
therefore shall ye observe this day

shall eat unleavened bread, until

whosoever eateth that which is

25 And it shall come to pass, when
ye be come to the land which the

hath promised, that ye shall keep

26 And it shall come to pass, when
your a children shall say unto you,
What mean ye by this service?
27 That ye shall say, It is the a sacrifice of the Lord’s b passover, who
passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he
smote the Egyptians, and c delivered
our houses. And the people bowed
the head and worshipped.
28 And the children of Israel went
away, and did as the Lord had
a 
commanded Moses and Aaron, so
did they.
29 ¶ And it came to pass, that at
midnight the Lord a smote all the
b 
firstborn in the land of Egypt, from
the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on
his throne unto the firstborn of the
captive that was in the dungeon;
and all the firstborn of cattle.
30 And Pharaoh rose up in the
night, he, and all his servants, and
all the Egyptians; and there was
a great cry in Egypt; for there was
not a house where there was not one
a 
dead.
31 ¶ And he called for Moses and
Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,
and get you a forth from among my
people, both ye and the children
of Israel; and go, serve the Lord,

33 And the Egyptians were a urgent
upon the people, that they might
send them out of the land in haste;
for they said, We be all dead men.
34 And the people took their dough
before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their
clothes upon their shoulders.
35 And the children of Israel did
according to the word of Moses;
and they a borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of b silver, and jewels
of gold, and c raiment:
36 And the Lord gave the people
a 
favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they b lent unto them
such things as they required. And they
c 
spoiled the Egyptians.
37 ¶ And the children of Israel
a 
journeyed from b Rameses to Succoth, about c six hundred thousand on
foot that were men, beside children.
38 And a a mixed multitude went
up also with them; and flocks, and
herds, even very much cattle.
39 And they baked a unleavened
cakes of the dough which they
brought forth out of Egypt, for it
was not leavened; because they were
b 
thrust out of Egypt, and could not
tarry, neither had they prepared for
themselves any c victual.
40 ¶ Now the a sojourning of the
children of Israel, who dwelt in
Egypt, was four hundred and thirty
years.

42 It is a night a to be much b observed unto the Lord for bringing
them out from the land of Egypt:
this is that night of the Lord to be
observed of all the children of c Israel in their generations.
43 ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance
of the a passover: There shall no
b 
stranger eat thereof:
44 But every man’s servant that
is a bought for money, when thou
hast circumcised him, then shall he
eat thereof.
45 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.
46 In one house shall it be eaten;
thou shalt not carry forth a ought of
the flesh b abroad out of the house; neither shall ye c break a d bone thereof.
47 All the congregation of Israel
shall keep it.
48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the
passover to the Lord, let all his
males be a circumcised, and then let
him come near and keep it; and he
shall be as one that is b born in the
land: for no uncircumcised person
shall eat thereof.
49 One law shall be to him that is
homeborn, and unto the stranger
that sojourneth among you.
50 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the a Lord commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

day, that the Lord did a bring the
children of Israel out of the land
of Egypt by their armies.

The firstborn of man and of beasts are to

of Unleavened Bread is to be kept in the
land of Canaan—Moses takes Joseph’s
bones out of Egypt—The Lord attends
Israel in a pillar of cloud by day and
a pillar of fire by night.
And the Lord spake unto Moses,
saying,
2 a Sanctify unto me all the b firstborn, whatsoever c  openeth the

both of man and of beast: it is mine.
3 ¶ And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which
ye came out from a Egypt, out of the
house of bondage; for by strength
of hand the Lord brought you out
from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.
4 This day a came ye out in b the

that the Lord’s law may be in thy
mouth: for with a strong hand hath
the Lord brought thee out of Egypt.
10 Thou shalt therefore keep this

11 ¶ And it shall be when the Lord

thou shalt redeem with a lamb;

16 And it shall be for a token upon
thine hand, and for a frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength
of hand the Lord brought us forth
out of Egypt.
17 ¶ And it came to pass, when
Pharaoh had let the people go, that
God led them not through the way
of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said,
Lest a peradventure the people b repent when they see war, and they
c 
return to Egypt:
18 But God a led the people about,
through the way of the wilderness
of the Red sea: and the children of
b 
Israel went up c harnessed out of
the land of Egypt.
19 And Moses took the bones of
a 
Joseph with him: for he had straitly
sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and
ye shall carry up my b bones away
hence with you.
20 ¶ And they took their journey
from a Succoth, and encamped in
Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.
21 And the a Lord went before
them by day in a pillar of a b cloud,
to c lead them the way; and by night
in a d pillar of fire, to give them light;
to go by day and night:
22 He took not away the pillar of
the cloud by day, nor the pillar of
fire by night, from before the people.

that they a turn and encamp before
Pi-hahiroth, between b Migdol and

before it shall ye encamp by the sea.
3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled
in the land, the wilderness hath
shut them in.
4 a And I will harden Pharaoh’s
heart, that he shall follow after
them; and I will be honoured b upon
Pharaoh, and upon all his c host; that
the Egyptians may d know that I am
the Lord. And they did so.
5 ¶ And it was told the king of
Egypt that the people fled: and the
heart of Pharaoh and of his servants
was turned against the people, and
they said, Why have we done this,
that we have let Israel go from
serving us?
6 And he made ready his chariot,
and took his people with him:
7 And he took six hundred chosen a chariots, and b all the chariots
of Egypt, and captains over every
one of them.
8  a And the Lord hardened the
heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt,
and he pursued after the children
of Israel: and the children of Israel
went out b with an c high hand.
9 But the Egyptians a pursued after
them, all the horses and chariots of

the children of Israel lifted up their
eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians
marched after them; and they were
sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord.
11 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt,
hast thou taken us away to a die in
the wilderness? wherefore hast
thou b dealt thus with us, to carry
us forth out of Egypt?
12 Is not this the a word that we
did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us
alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us
to b serve the Egyptians, than that
we should die in the wilderness.
13 ¶ And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see
the salvation of the Lord, which
he will a shew to you to day: for
the Egyptians whom ye have seen
to day, ye shall see them again no
more for ever.
14 The Lord shall a fight for you,
and ye shall hold your b peace.
15 ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?
speak unto the children of Israel,
that they go forward:
16 But lift thou up thy a rod, and
stretch out thine hand over the sea,
and b divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on c dry ground through
the midst of the sea.
17 a And I, behold, I will b harden
the hearts of the Egyptians, and
they shall follow them: and c I will
get me honour upon Pharaoh, and
upon all his host, upon his chariots,
and upon his horsemen.

Exodus 14:26–15:9

Let us flee from the face of Israel;
for the Lord fighteth for them
against the Egyptians.
26 ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine a hand over the
sea, that the waters may come again
upon the Egyptians, upon their
chariots, and upon their horsemen.
27 And Moses stretched forth his
hand over the sea, and the sea returned to a his strength when the
morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled b against it; and the Lord
overthrew the c Egyptians in the
midst of the sea.
28 And the a waters returned, and
b 
covered the chariots, and the horse­
men, and all the host of Pharaoh
that came into the c sea after them;
there remained not so much as d one
of them.
29 But the children of Israel walked
upon a dry land in the midst of the
sea; and the waters were a wall unto
them on their right hand, and on
their left.
30 Thus the Lord a saved Israel that
day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians
dead upon the sea shore.
31 And Israel saw that great work
which the Lord did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the
Lord, and a believed the Lord, and
his servant Moses.

Then a sang Moses and the children
of Israel this song unto the Lord,
and spake, saying, I will b sing unto
the Lord, for he hath triumphed
gloriously: the horse and his rider
hath he thrown into the sea.
2 The a Lord is my b strength and

6 Thy a right b hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power: thy right
hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces
the enemy.
7 And in the greatness of thine
excellency thou hast overthrown
them that rose up against thee: thou
sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as a stubble.
8 And with the blast of thy nostrils
the a waters were gathered together,
the floods stood upright as an b heap,
and the depths were congealed in
the heart of the sea.
9 The enemy said, I will a pursue,
I will overtake, I will divide the

upon them; I will draw my sword,
my hand shall destroy them.

Exodus 16:1–15
Chapter 16

Israel murmurs for want of bread and
lusts for the fleshpots of Egypt—The
Lord rains bread from heaven and
sends quail for meat—Israel is given
manna each day, except the Sabbath,
for forty years.
And they took their journey from
Elim, and all the congregation of
the children of Israel came unto the
wilderness of Sin, which is between
Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day
of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.
2 And the whole congregation of
the children of Israel a murmured
against Moses and Aaron in the
wilderness:
3 And the children of Israel said
unto them, Would to God we had died
by the hand of the Lord in the land
of Egypt, when we sat by the a flesh
pots, and when we did eat bread
to the full; for ye have brought us
forth into this wilderness, to kill
this whole assembly with b hunger.
4 ¶ Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain a bread from
heaven for you; and the people
shall go out and gather a certain
b 
rate every day, that I may c prove
them, whether they will d walk in
my law, or no.
5 And it shall come to pass, that on
the sixth day they shall prepare that
which they bring in; and it shall be
twice as much as they gather daily.
6 And Moses and Aaron said unto
all the children of Israel, At even,
then ye shall know that the Lord
hath brought you out from the land
of Egypt:

shall see the a glory of the Lord; for
that he heareth your murmurings
against the Lord: and what are we,
that ye murmur against us?
8 And Moses said, This shall be,
when the Lord shall give you in
the evening flesh to eat, and in the
morning bread to the full; for that
the Lord heareth your murmurings
which ye murmur against him: and
what are we? your a murmurings
are not against us, but b against the
Lord.
9 ¶ And Moses a spake unto Aaron,
Say unto all the congregation of
the children of Israel, Come near
before the Lord: for he hath heard
your murmurings.
10 And it came to pass, as Aaron
spake unto the whole congregation
of the children of Israel, that they
looked toward the wilderness, and,
behold, the a glory of the Lord appeared in the b cloud.
11 ¶ And the Lord spake unto
Moses, saying,
12 I have heard the a murmurings
of the children of Israel: speak unto
them, saying, At even ye shall eat
flesh, and in the morning ye shall be
filled with bread; and ye shall know
that I am the Lord your God.
13 And it came to pass, that at
even the a quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning
the dew lay round about the b host.
14 And when the dew that lay
was gone up, behold, upon the face
of the wilderness there lay a small

frost on the ground.

saw it, they said one to another, a It

was. And Moses said unto them,
This is the c bread which the Lord
hath given you to eat.
16 ¶ This is the thing which the
Lord hath commanded, Gather of
it every man a according to b his eating, an c omer for every man, according to the number of your persons;
take ye every man for them which
are in his tents.
17 And the children of Israel did
so, and gathered, some more, some
less.
18 And when they did mete it with
an omer, he that a gathered much had
nothing over, and he that gathered
little had no lack; they gathered
every man according to his eating.
19 And Moses said, Let no man
leave of it till the morning.
20 Notwithstanding they a heark­
ened not unto Moses; but some of
them left of it until the morning,
and it bred worms, and stank: and
Moses was wroth with them.
21 And they gathered it every
morning, every man according to
his eating: and when the sun a waxed
hot, it melted.
22 ¶ And it came to pass, that on
the sixth day they gathered twice
as much bread, two omers for one
man: and all the rulers of the a congregation came and told Moses.
23 And he said unto them, This
is that which the Lord hath said,
To morrow is the rest of the holy
a 
sabbath unto the Lord: b  bake
that which ye will bake to day, and
c 
seethe that ye will seethe; and that
which remaineth over lay up for
you to be kept until the morning.
24 And they laid it up till the
morning, as Moses bade: and it did
not stink, neither was there any
worm therein.
25 And Moses said, Eat that to day;
for to day is a sabbath unto the

Lord: to day ye shall not find it in
the field.
26 Six days ye shall gather it; but
on the seventh day, which is the
sabbath, in it there shall be none.
27 ¶ And it came to pass, that there
went out some of the people on the
seventh day for to gather, and they
found none.
28 And the Lord said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to a keep
my commandments and my laws?
29 See, for that the Lord hath given
you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread
of two days; abide ye every man in
his place, let no man go out of his
place on the seventh day.
30 So the people rested on the
seventh day.
31 And the house of Israel called
the name thereof Manna: and it
was like a coriander seed, white; and
the taste of it was like wafers made
with honey.
32 ¶ And Moses said, This is the
thing which the Lord commandeth,
Fill an omer of it to be kept for your
a 
generations; that they may see the
bread wherewith I have fed you in
the wilderness, when I brought you
forth from the land of Egypt.
33 And Moses said unto Aaron,
Take a a pot, and put an omer full
of manna therein, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your
generations.
34 As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the
a 
Testimony, to be kept.
35 And the children of Israel did
eat a manna forty years, until they
came to a land inhabited; they did
eat manna, until they came unto
the borders of the land of Canaan.

Chapter 17

Israel murmurs for want of water—Moses smites a rock in Horeb, and water
gushes forth—Aaron and Hur uphold
Moses’ hands so that Joshua prevails
against Amalek.
And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the
wilderness of a Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the Lord, and b pitched in
Rephidim: and there was no water
for the people to drink.
2 Wherefore the people a did chide
with Moses, and said, Give us water
that we may drink. And Moses said
unto them, Why chide ye with me?
wherefore do ye b tempt the Lord?
3 And the people thirsted there for
water; and the people a murmured
against Moses, and said, Wherefore
is this that thou hast brought us
up out of Egypt, to kill us and our
children and our cattle with thirst?
4 And Moses cried unto the Lord,
saying, What shall I do unto this
people? they be almost ready to
stone me.
5 And the Lord said unto Moses,
Go on before the people, and take
with thee of the elders of Israel; and
thy a rod, b wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand,
and go.
6 Behold, I will stand before thee
there upon the rock in Horeb; and
thou shalt a smite the b rock, and there
shall come c water out of it, that the
people may drink. And Moses did so
in the sight of the elders of Israel.

place a Massah, and b Meribah, because of the c chiding of the children
of Israel, and because they tempted
the Lord, saying, Is the Lord among
us, or not?
8 ¶ Then came a Amalek, and fought
with Israel in Rephidim.
9 And Moses said unto a Joshua,
Choose us out men, and go out, fight
with Amalek: to morrow I will stand
on the top of the hill with the b rod
of God in mine hand.
10 So Joshua did as Moses had said
to him, and fought with Amalek:
and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went
up to the top of the hill.
11 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel
prevailed: and when he let down
his hand, Amalek prevailed.
12 But Moses’ hands a were heavy;
and they took a stone, and put it
under him, and he sat thereon;
and Aaron and Hur b stayed up his
hands, the one on the one side, and
the other on the other side; and his
hands were steady until the going
down of the sun.
13 And Joshua a discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of
the sword.
14 And the Lord said unto Moses,
Write this for a memorial in a a book,
and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua:
for I will utterly put out the remembrance of b Amalek from under
heaven.

Chapter 18
Jethro comes to Moses bringing Moses’
wife and sons and offers sacrifices to
the Lord—Moses sits in the judgment
seat and hears all cases—Jethro counsels
Moses to teach the law, to appoint lesser
judges, and to delegate power to them.
When a Jethro, the b priest of c Midian, Moses’ father in law, heard of
all that d God had done for Moses,
and for Israel his people, and that
the Lord had brought Israel out
of Egypt;
2 Then Jethro, Moses’ father in law,
took a Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after
he had sent her back,
3 And her two a sons; of which the
name of the one was b Gershom; for
he said, c I have been an alien in a
strange land:
4 And the name of the other was
a 
Eliezer; for the God of my father,
said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:
5 And Jethro, Moses’ father in law,
came with his sons and his wife unto
Moses into the wilderness, where
he encamped at the a mount of God:
6 And he a said unto Moses, I thy
father in law Jethro am come unto
thee, and thy wife, and her two
sons with her.
7 ¶ And Moses went out to meet
his father in law, and did obeisance,
and kissed him; and they asked each
other of their welfare; and they came
into the tent.
8 And Moses told his father in law

all that the Lord had done unto
Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for
Israel’s sake, and all the travail that
had come upon them by the way,
and how the Lord delivered them.
9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the
goodness which the Lord had done
to Israel, whom he had delivered
out of the hand of the Egyptians.
10 And Jethro said, Blessed be the
Lord, who hath delivered you out of
the hand of the Egyptians, and out
of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath
delivered the people from under
the hand of the Egyptians.
11 Now I know that the Lord is
greater than all gods: for in the
thing wherein they dealt a proudly
he was above them.
12 And Jethro, Moses’ father in law,
took a burnt offering and sacrifices
for God: and Aaron came, and all the
elders of Israel, to eat a bread with
Moses’ father in law before God.
13 ¶ And it came to pass on the
morrow, that Moses sat to a judge
the people: and the people stood
by Moses from the morning unto
the evening.
14 And when Moses’ father in law
saw all that he did to the people,
he said, What is this thing that
thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the
people stand by thee from morning
unto even?
15 And Moses said unto his father
in law, Because the people come
unto me to a inquire of God:
16 When they have a a matter, they
come unto me; and I judge between
one and another, and I do make
them know the statutes of God, and

Exodus 18:17–19:5

17 And Moses’ father in law said
unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.
18 Thou wilt surely wear away,
both thou, and this people that
is with thee: for this thing is a too
heavy for thee; thou art not able to
perform it thyself alone.
19 Hearken now unto my voice,
I will give thee counsel, and God
shall be with thee: a Be thou for
the people to b God-ward, that thou
mayest bring the causes unto God:
20 And thou shalt a teach them
b 
ordinances and c laws, and shalt
shew them the d way wherein they
must e walk, and the work that they
must do.
21 Moreover thou shalt provide out
of all the people a able men, such
as b fear God, c men of truth, hating
d 
covetousness; and place such over
them, to be e rulers of thousands,
and rulers of f hundreds, rulers of
fifties, and rulers of tens:
22 And let them a judge the people
at all seasons: and it shall be, that
every great matter they shall bring
unto thee, but every small matter
they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear
the b burden with thee.
23 If thou shalt do this thing, and
God command thee so, then thou
shalt be able to endure, and all this
people shall also go to their place
in peace.
24 So Moses hearkened to the voice
of his father in law, and did all that
he had said.
25 And Moses chose able men out
of all Israel, and made them a heads

26 And they judged the people at
all seasons: the hard causes they
brought unto Moses, but every small
matter they judged themselves.
27 ¶ And Moses let his father in
law depart; and he went his way
into his own land.
Chapter 19
The Lord covenants to make Israel a
peculiar treasure, a kingdom of priests,
and a holy nation—The people sanctify
themselves—The Lord appears on Sinai amid fire, smoke, and earthquakes.
In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out
of the land of Egypt, the same day
came they into the a wilderness of
Sinai.
2 For they were departed from
Rephidim, and were come to the
desert of Sinai, and had a pitched
in the wilderness; and there Israel
camped before the mount.
3 And Moses went up unto God,
and the Lord a called unto him out
of the b mountain, saying, Thus shalt

on a eagles’ wings, and brought you
unto myself.
5 Now therefore, if ye will a obey

6 And ye shall be unto me a a kingdom of  b priests, and an c holy d nation.
These are the words which thou shalt
speak unto the children of Israel.
7 ¶ And Moses came and called for
the elders of the people, and laid
before their faces all these words
which the Lord a commanded him.
8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the Lord
hath spoken we will a do. And Moses
returned the words of the people
unto the Lord.
9 And the Lord said unto Moses,

day: for the third day the Lord will

14 ¶ And Moses went down from
the mount unto the people, and
sanctified the people; and they
washed their clothes.
15 And he said unto the people, Be
ready against the third day: a come
not at your wives.
16 ¶ And it came to pass on the
third day in the morning, that there
were thunders and lightnings, and
a thick cloud upon the mount, and
the voice of the trumpet exceeding
loud; so that all the people that was
in the camp trembled.
17 And Moses brought forth the
people out of the camp to a meet
with God; and they stood at the
b 
nether part of the mount.
18 And mount a Sinai was b altogether on a c smoke, because the
Lord d descended upon it in e fire:
and the smoke thereof ascended
as the smoke of a furnace, and the
whole f mount quaked greatly.
19 And when the voice of the

louder and louder, Moses spake,
and God answered him by a b voice.
20 And the Lord came down upon

Moses went up.

23 And Moses said unto the Lord,
The people cannot come up to
mount Sinai: for thou chargedst
us, saying, Set bounds about the
mount, and sanctify it.
24 And the Lord said unto him,
Away, get thee down, and thou shalt
come up, thou, and Aaron with
thee: but let not the priests and the
people break through to come up

fathers upon the f children unto the
third and fourth generation of them
that g hate me;
6 And shewing a mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and

7 Thou shalt not take the a name

that is within thy gates:

4 If his master have given him a

or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he

5 And if the servant shall plainly

The Lord reveals His laws pertaining to
stealing, destructions by fire, care of the
property of others, borrowing, lascivious
acts, sacrifices to false gods, afflicting
widows, usury, reviling God, and the
firstborn of men and of animals—The
men of Israel are commanded to be holy.
If a man shall a steal an ox, or a
sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall
b 
restore five oxen for an ox, and
c 
four sheep for a sheep.
2 ¶ If a thief be found a breaking
b 
up, and be smitten that he die,
there shall no blood be shed for him.
3 If the sun be risen upon him,
there shall be blood shed for him; for
he should make full restitution; if
he have nothing, then he shall be
sold for his theft.
4 If the theft be certainly found in
his hand alive, whether it be ox, or
ass, or sheep; he shall a restore double.
5 ¶ If a man shall cause a field or
vineyard to be eaten, and shall a put
in his beast, and shall feed in another man’s field; of the best of his
own field, and of the best of his own
vineyard, shall he make restitution.
6 ¶ If fire break out, and catch in
thorns, so that the stacks of a corn,
or the standing corn, or the field,
be consumed therewith; he that
b 
kindled the fire shall surely make
restitution.
7 ¶ If a man shall deliver unto his
neighbour money or stuff to keep,
and it be stolen out of the man’s
house; if the thief be found, let him
pay double.
8 If the thief be not found, then
the master of the house shall be
brought unto the a judges, to see
whether he have put his hand unto
his neighbour’s goods.

to be his, the cause of both parties
shall come before the judges; and
whom the judges shall condemn, he
shall pay double unto his neighbour.
10 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep,
or any beast, to keep; and it die, or
be hurt, or driven away, no man
seeing it:
11 Then shall an a oath of the Lord
be between them both, that he hath
not put his hand unto his neighbour’s goods; and the owner of it
shall accept thereof, and he shall
not b make it good.
12 And if it be stolen from him,
he shall make restitution unto the
owner thereof.
13 If it be a torn in pieces, then let
him bring it for witness, and he shall
not make good that which was torn.
14 ¶ And if a man a borrow b ought
of his neighbour, and it be hurt,
or die, the owner thereof being not
with it, he shall surely make it good.
15 But if the owner thereof be with
it, he shall not make it good: if it be
an hired thing, it came for his hire.
16 ¶ And if a man entice a maid
that is not betrothed, and lie with
her, he shall surely endow her to
be his a wife.

give her unto him, he shall pay
money according to the dowry of

The Lord reveals His laws pertaining to
integrity and godly conduct—The land
is to rest during a sabbatical year—
The children of Israel are to keep three
annual feasts—An angel, bearing the
Lord’s name, will guide them—Sickness will be removed—The nations of
Canaan will be driven out gradually.
Thou shalt not raise a a false report:
put not thine hand with the wicked
to be an unrighteous witness.
2 ¶ a Thou shalt not b follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou
speak in a cause to decline after
many to wrest c judgment:
3 ¶ Neither shalt thou a countenance a b poor man in his cause.

or his ass going astray, thou shalt
surely b bring it back to him again.
5 If thou see the ass of him that
hateth thee lying under his burden,
and wouldest forbear to help him,
thou shalt surely a help with him.
6 Thou shalt not a wrest the b judgment of thy poor in his c cause.
7 Keep thee far from a false a matter; and the innocent and righteous
slay thou not: for I will not b justify

let it rest and lie still; that the b poor
of thy people may eat: and what
they leave the beasts of the field
shall eat. In like manner thou shalt
deal with thy vineyard, and with

17 Three times in the year all

Lord God.
18 Thou shalt not offer the a blood
of my sacrifice with b  leavened
bread; neither shall the fat of my
sacrifice remain until the morning.
19 The first of the a firstfruits of
thy land thou shalt bring into the
house of the Lord thy God. Thou
shalt not b seethe a kid in his mother’s milk.
20 ¶ Behold, I send an a Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way,
and to bring thee into the place
which I have prepared.
21 Beware of him, and obey his
voice, a provoke him not; for he will
not b pardon your c transgressions:
for my name is in him.
22 But if thou shalt indeed obey
his voice, and do all that I speak;
then I will be an enemy unto thine
a 
enemies, and an adversary unto
thine adversaries.
23 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto
the Amorites, and the Hittites, and
the Perizzites, and the Canaanites,
the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and
I will cut them off.
24 Thou shalt not a bow down to
their gods, nor serve them, nor do
after their works: but thou shalt
utterly b overthrow them, and quite
break down their images.
25 And ye shall serve the Lord your
God, and he shall bless thy a bread,
and thy water; and I will take b sickness away from the midst of thee.

And he said unto Moses, Come up

a 
Nadab, and Abihu, and b seventy
of the elders of Israel; and worship
ye afar off.
2 And Moses alone shall come near
the Lord: but they shall not come
nigh; neither shall the people go
up with him.
3 ¶ And Moses came and told the
people all the words of the Lord,
and all the a judgments: and all the
people answered with one b voice,
and said, All the words which the
Lord hath said will we do.
4 And Moses a wrote all the words
of the Lord, and rose up early in
the morning, and builded an b altar
c 
under the hill, and twelve d pillars,
according to the twelve tribes of
Israel.
5 And he sent young men of the
children of Israel, which offered
burnt offerings, and sacrificed
a 
peace offerings of oxen unto the
Lord.
6 And Moses took half of the a blood,
and put it in basins; and half of the
blood he sprinkled on the altar.
7 And he took the book of the a covenant, and b read in the audience of
the people: and they said, All that
the Lord hath said will we do, and
be c obedient.
8 And Moses took the a blood, and
b 
sprinkled it on the people, and said,
Behold the c blood of the d covenant,
which the Lord hath made with you
concerning all these words.

my offering.

The tabernacle is to be built with ten

holy place—The ark of testimony (with
the mercy seat) is to be put in the most

Moreover thou shalt make the
tabernacle with ten b curtains of fine
twined linen, and blue, and purple,

shalt thou make in the edge of the
curtain that is in the coupling of
the second; that the loops may take

13 And a cubit on the one side,
and a cubit on the other side of that
which remaineth in the length of
the curtains of the tent, it shall hang
over the sides of the tabernacle on
this side and on that side, to cover it.

dyed red, and a covering above of
badgers’ skins.

shall be the breadth of one board.
17 Two tenons shall there be in one

thou shalt take his blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar.
17 And thou shalt cut the ram in

flesh in the holy place.
32 And Aaron and his sons shall
eat the flesh of the ram, and the
bread that is in the basket, by the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
33 And they shall a eat those things
wherewith the atonement was made,
to consecrate and to sanctify them:
but a b stranger shall not eat thereof,
because they are holy.
34 And if ought of the flesh of the
consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou
shalt burn the remainder with
fire: it shall not be eaten, because
it is holy.
35 And thus shalt thou do unto
Aaron, and to his sons, according to
all things which I have commanded
thee: a seven days shalt thou b consecrate them.
36 And thou shalt offer every
day a bullock for a sin offering for
atonement: and thou shalt cleanse
the altar, when thou hast made an
atonement for it, and thou shalt
anoint it, to sanctify it.
37 Seven days thou shalt make an
atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most

shall be holy.

Moses, saying,
12 When thou takest the a sum of
the children of Israel after their
number, then shall they give every
man a b ransom for his soul unto the
Lord, when thou numberest them;
that there be no plague among them,
when thou numberest them.
13 This they shall a give, every one
that passeth among them that are
numbered, half a b shekel after the
c 
shekel of the sanctuary: (a d shekel
is twenty gerahs:) an half e shekel
shall be the offering of the Lord.
14 Every one that passeth among
them that are numbered, from
twenty years old and above, shall
give an offering unto the Lord.
15 The rich shall not give more,
and the poor shall not give less than
half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the Lord, to make an
a 
atonement for your souls.
16 And thou shalt take the atonement a money of the children of
Israel, and shalt appoint it for the
service of the b tabernacle of the
congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel
before the Lord, to make an atonement for your souls.
17 ¶ And the Lord spake unto
Moses, saying,
18 Thou shalt also make a laver of
brass, and his foot also of brass, a to

between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou
shalt put water therein.

Moses, saying,

half so much, even two hundred and
fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus
two hundred and fifty shekels,
24 And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary,
and of a oil olive an hin:
25 And thou shalt make it an a oil
of holy b ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the c apothecary: it shall be an holy d anointing

26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,
27 And the table and all a his vessels, and the candlestick and his
vessels, and the altar of incense,

with all his vessels, and the laver

that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.

34 ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet a spices,
stacte, and onycha, and galbanum;
these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a
like weight:
35 And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of
the apothecary, tempered together,
pure and holy:
36 And thou shalt beat some of
it very small, and put of it before
the testimony in the tabernacle
of the congregation, where I will
a 
meet with thee: it shall be unto
you most holy.
37 And as for the perfume which
thou shalt make, ye shall not make

thee holy for the Lord.

that, to smell thereto, shall even be

2 And Aaron said unto them, Break
off the a golden earrings, which are
in the ears of your wives, of your
sons, and of your daughters, and
bring them unto me.
3 And all the people brake off the
golden earrings which were in their
ears, and brought them unto Aaron.
4 And he received them at their
hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a a molten calf: and they said, b These be
thy c gods, O Israel, which brought
thee up out of the land of Egypt.
5 And when Aaron saw it, he built
an altar before it; and Aaron made
proclamation, and said, To morrow
is a feast to the Lord.
6 And they rose up early on the
morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought a peace offerings;
and the b people sat down to eat and
to drink, and rose up to play.
7 ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of
the land of Egypt, have a corrupted
themselves:
8 They have a turned aside b quickly
out of the way which I commanded
them: they have made them a c molten calf, and have worshipped it,

10 Now therefore let me alone,
that my a wrath may wax hot against

11 And Moses a besought the Lord
his God, and said, Lord, why doth
thy wrath wax hot against thy
people, which thou hast brought
forth out of the land of Egypt with
great power, and with a mighty
hand?
12 Wherefore should the a Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief
did he bring them out, to slay them
in the mountains, and to consume
them from the face of the earth?
Turn from thy fierce b wrath, and c repent of this evil against thy people.

17 And when a Joshua heard the
noise of the people as they b shouted,
he said unto Moses, There is a noise
of war in the camp.
18 And he said, It is not the voice
of them that a shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry
for being overcome: but the noise
of them that sing do I hear.
19 ¶ And it came to pass, as soon
as he came nigh unto the camp, that
he a saw the calf, and the dancing:
and Moses’ b anger waxed hot, and
he cast the tables out of his hands,
and c brake them beneath the mount.
20 And he took the a calf which
they had made, and burnt it in the
fire, and ground it to powder, and
b 
strawed it upon the c water, and
made the children of Israel drink of it.
21 And Moses said unto Aaron,
What did this people unto thee,
that thou hast brought so great a
sin upon them?
22 And Aaron said, Let not the
a 
anger of my lord wax hot: thou
knowest the people, that they are
b 
set on c mischief.
23 For they said unto me, a Make
us b gods, which shall go before us:
for as for this Moses, the man that
brought us up out of the land of
Egypt, we wot not what is become

24 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break
it off. So they gave it me: then I cast
it into the fire, and there came out
this calf.

26 Then Moses stood in the gate of
the camp, and said, Who is on the
Lord’s side? let him come unto me.
And all the sons of Levi gathered
themselves together unto him.
27 And he said unto them, Thus
saith the Lord God of Israel, Put
every man his sword by his side,
and go in and out from gate to gate
throughout the camp, and a slay every man his brother, and every man
his companion, and every man his
neighbour.
28 And the children of Levi did
according to the word of Moses: and
there fell of the people that day

upon you a c blessing this day.

people, Ye have a sinned a great
sin: and now I will go up unto the
Lord; b peradventure I shall make
an c atonement for your sin.
31 And Moses returned unto the
Lord, and said, Oh, this people have
sinned a great sin, and have made
them a gods of gold.
32 Yet now, if thou wilt a forgive
their sin—; and if not, b blot me, I
pray thee, out of thy c book which

34 Therefore now go, a lead the people unto the place of which I have
spoken unto thee: behold, mine
b 
Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will
visit their sin upon them.
35 And the Lord plagued the people, because they made the calf,
which Aaron made.
Chapter 33
The Lord promises to be with Israel
and drive out the people of the land—
The tabernacle of the congregation is
moved away from the camp—The Lord
speaks to Moses face to face in the tabernacle—Later, Moses sees the glory of
God but not His face.
And the Lord said unto Moses, a Depart, and go up hence, thou and the
people which thou hast brought up
out of the land of Egypt, unto the
land which I sware unto Abraham,
to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto
thy b seed will I give it:
2 And I will send an a angel before
thee; and I will drive out the b Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite,
and the Jebusite:
3 Unto a land a flowing with milk
and honey: for I will not go up in
the midst of thee; for thou art a
stiffnecked people: lest I consume
thee in the way.
4 ¶ And when the people heard
these evil tidings, they a mourned:
and no man did put on him his
b 
ornaments.
5 For the Lord had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel,
Ye are a a stiffnecked people: b I will

6 And the children of Israel strip­
ped themselves of their ornaments
by the mount Horeb.
7 And Moses took the tabernacle,
and pitched it without the camp,
afar off from the camp, and called
it the a Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that
every one which sought the Lord
went out unto the b tabernacle of
the congregation, which was without the camp.
8 And it came to pass, when Moses
went out unto the tabernacle, that
all the people rose up, and stood
every man at his a tent door, and
looked after Moses, until he was
gone into the tabernacle.
9 And it came to pass, as Moses
entered into the tabernacle, the
a 
cloudy pillar descended, and stood
at the door of the tabernacle, and
the Lord talked with Moses.
10 And all the people saw the
cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose
up and worshipped, every man in
his tent door.
11 And the Lord a spake unto Moses
b 
face to face, as a man c speaketh unto
his d friend. And he turned again into
the camp: but his servant e Joshua,
the son of f Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.

b

rose up early in the morning, and
went up unto mount Sinai, as the
Lord had commanded him, and took
in his hand the two tables of stone.
5 And the Lord descended in the
cloud, and stood with him there, and
a 
proclaimed the name of the Lord.
6 And the Lord passed by before
him, and proclaimed, The Lord,
The Lord God, a merciful and b gracious, c longsuffering, and abundant
in d goodness and truth,
7 Keeping mercy for thousands,
a 
forgiving iniquity and transgression and b sin, c and that will by no

iniquity of the fathers upon the
children, and upon the children’s
children, unto the third and to the

a 
bowed his head toward the earth,
and worshipped.
9 And he said, If now I have found
a 
grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my
Lord, I pray thee, go among us;
for it is a b stiffnecked people; and
c 
pardon our iniquity and our sin,
and take us for d thine e inheritance.

Moses’ face shone: and Moses put

he went in to speak with him.

Chapter 35
Israel is admonished to observe the
Sabbath—Free gifts are offered for the
tabernacle—The calls and inspiration
of certain artisans are confirmed.
And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These
are the words which the Lord hath
commanded, that ye should do them.
2 a Six days shall b work be done,
but on the seventh day there shall
be to you an holy day, a c sabbath of
rest to the Lord: whosoever doeth
work therein shall be put to d death.
3 Ye shall a kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.
4 ¶ And Moses spake unto all the
congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which
the Lord a commanded, saying,
5 Take ye from among you an off­
ering unto the Lord: whosoever is
of a a willing heart, let him bring it,
an offering of the Lord; gold, and

Israel had brought for the work of
the service of the sanctuary, to make
it withal. And they brought yet unto
him b free offerings every morning.
4 And all the a  wise men, that
wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his
work which they made;
5 ¶ And they spake unto Moses,
saying, The people a bring much
more than enough for the service
of the work, which the Lord commanded to make.
6 And Moses gave commandment,
and they caused it to be proclaimed
throughout the camp, saying, Let
neither man nor woman make any
more work for the offering of the
sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.
7 For the a stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it,
and too much.
8 ¶ And every wise hearted man
among them that wrought the work
of the tabernacle a made ten b curtains
of fine twined linen, and blue, and
purple, and scarlet: with cherubims
of cunning work made he them.
9 The length of a one curtain was
twenty and eight cubits, and the
breadth of one curtain four cubits:
the curtains were all of one size.
10 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the
other five curtains he coupled one
unto another.
11 And he made loops of blue on
the edge of one curtain a from the
selvedge in the coupling: likewise
he made in the uttermost side of
another curtain, in the coupling of
the second.
12 Fifty loops made he in one
curtain, and fifty loops made he in
the edge of the curtain which was
in the coupling of the second: the
loops held one curtain to another.

unto another with the taches: so it
became one tabernacle.
14 ¶ And he made curtains of
goats’ hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made
them.
15 The length of one curtain was
thirty cubits, and four cubits was the
breadth of one curtain: the eleven
curtains were of one size.
16 And he coupled five curtains
by themselves, and six curtains by
themselves.
17 And he made fifty loops upon
the uttermost edge of  a the curtain
in the coupling, and fifty loops
made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.
18 And he made fifty taches of
brass to couple the tent together,
that it might be one.
19 And he made a covering for the
tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and
a covering of badgers’ skins above
that.
20 ¶ And he made a boards for
the tabernacle of b shittim wood,
standing up.
21 The length of a board was ten
cubits, and the breadth of a board
one cubit and a half.
22 One board had two tenons,
a 
equally distant one from another:
thus did he make for all the boards
of the tabernacle.
23 And he made boards for the
tabernacle; twenty boards for the
south side southward:
24 And forty a sockets of silver he
made under the twenty boards; two
sockets under one board for his
two tenons, and two sockets under
another board for his two tenons.
25 And for the other side of the
tabernacle, which is toward the
north corner, he made twenty
boards,

27 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.
28 And two boards made he for
the corners of the tabernacle in
the a two sides.
29 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the
head thereof, to one ring: thus he
did to both of them in both the
corners.
30 And there were eight boards;
and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two
sockets.
31 ¶ And he made bars of shittim
wood; five for the boards of the one
side of the tabernacle,
32 And five bars for the boards
of the other side of the tabernacle,
and five bars for the boards of the
tabernacle for the sides westward.
33 And he made the middle bar
to a shoot through the boards from
the one end to the other.
34 And he overlaid the boards
with gold, and made their rings of
gold to be places for the bars, and
overlaid the bars with gold.
35 ¶ And he made a a veil of blue,
and purple, and scarlet, and fine
twined linen: with cherubims made
he it of cunning work.
36 And he made thereunto four
pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid
them with gold: their hooks were
of gold; and he cast for them four
sockets of silver.
37 ¶ And he made a an hanging
for the tabernacle door of blue, and
purple, and scarlet, and fine twined
linen, of needlework;

Bezaleel makes the ark, the mercy seat,
and the cherubims—He makes the table,

altar, the holy anointing oil, and the
sweet incense.
And Bezaleel a made the b ark of
shittim wood: two cubits and a half
was the length of it, and a cubit and
a half the breadth of it, and a cubit
and a half the height of it:
2 And he overlaid it with pure
gold within and without, and made
a a crown of gold to it round about.
3 And he cast for it four rings of
gold, to be set by the four corners
of it; even two rings upon the one
side of it, and two rings upon the
other side of it.
4 And he made staves of shittim
wood, and overlaid them with
gold.
5 And he put the staves into the
rings by the sides of the ark, to
bear the ark.
6 ¶ And he made the a  mercy
seat of pure gold: two cubits and
a half was the length thereof, and
one cubit and a half the breadth
thereof.
7 And he made two a cherubims of
gold, beaten out of one piece made
he them, on the two ends of the
mercy seat;
8 One cherub on the end on this
side, and another cherub on the
other end on that side: a out of the
mercy seat made he the cherubims
on the two ends thereof.
9 And the a cherubims spread out
their wings on high, and covered
with their wings over the mercy
seat, with their faces one to another;
even to the mercy seatward were the
faces of the cherubims.

11 And he overlaid it with pure
gold, and made thereunto a crown
of gold round about.
12 Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about;
and made a crown of gold for the
border thereof round about.
13 And he cast for it four rings of
gold, and put the rings upon the
four corners that were in the four
feet thereof.
14 a Over against the border were
the rings, the places for the staves
to bear the table.
15 And he made the staves of
shittim wood, and overlaid them
with gold, to bear the table.
16 And he made the a vessels which
were upon the table, his dishes,
and his spoons, and his bowls, and
b 
his covers to cover withal, of pure
gold.
17 ¶ And he made the a candlestick
of pure gold: of beaten work made
he the candlestick; his shaft, and
b 
his branch, his bowls, c his knops,
and his flowers, were of the same:
18 And six branches going out of
the sides thereof; three branches
of the candlestick out of the one
side thereof, and three branches
of the candlestick out of the other
side thereof:
19 Three bowls made after the
fashion of almonds in one branch,

so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick.

24 Of a talent of pure gold made
he it, and all the vessels thereof.

a 
altar of shittim wood: the length
of it was a cubit, and the breadth
of it a cubit; it was foursquare; and
two cubits was the height of it; the
horns thereof were of the same.
26 And he overlaid it with pure
gold, both the top of it, and the sides
thereof round about, and the horns
of it: also he made unto it a crown
of gold round about.
27 And he made two rings of gold
for it under the crown thereof, by
the two corners of it, upon the two
sides thereof, to be places for the
staves a to bear it withal.
28 And he made the staves of
shittim wood, and overlaid them
with gold.

4 And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under a the

5 And he cast four rings for the
four ends of the grate of brass, to

to work it in the blue, and in the

inclosed in a ouches of gold, graven,
as signets are graven, with the names

19 And they made two rings of
gold, and put them on the two ends
of the breastplate, upon the border
of it, which was on the side of the
ephod inward.
20 And they made two other golden
rings, and put them on the two sides
of the ephod underneath, toward
the forepart of it, over against the
other coupling thereof, above the
curious girdle of the ephod.
21 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings
of the ephod with a lace of blue,
that it might be above the curious
girdle of the ephod, and that the
breastplate might not be loosed
from the ephod; as the Lord commanded Moses.
22 ¶ And he made the robe of the
ephod of woven work, all of blue.
23 And there was an hole in the
midst of the robe, as the hole of an

24 And they made upon the hems

and purple, and scarlet, and twined

25 And they made bells of pure
gold, and put the bells between
the pomegranates upon the hem
of the robe, round about between
the pomegranates;
26 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell
and a pomegranate, round about the
hem of the robe to minister in; as
the Lord commanded Moses.
27 ¶ And they made coats of fine
a 
linen of woven work for Aaron,
and for his sons,
28 And a a mitre of fine linen, and
b 
goodly c bonnets of fine linen, and
linen d breeches of fine twined linen,

the holy crown of pure gold, and
wrote upon it a writing, like to the
engravings of a signet, a Holiness
to the Lord.
31 And they tied unto it a lace of
blue, to fasten it on high upon the
mitre; as the Lord commanded

32 ¶ Thus was all the work of the
tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all
that the Lord a commanded Moses,
so did they.

16 Thus did Moses: according to
all that the Lord commanded him,
so did he.
17 ¶ And it came to pass in the
first month in the second year, on
the first day of the month, that the
tabernacle was a reared up.
18 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened a his sockets,
and set up the boards thereof, and
put in the bars thereof, and reared
up his pillars.
19 And he spread abroad the tent
over the tabernacle, and put the
covering of the tent above upon
it; as the Lord commanded Moses.
20 ¶ And he took and put the
a 
testimony into the ark, and set
the b staves on the ark, and put the
mercy seat above upon the ark:
21 And he brought the ark into the
tabernacle, and set up the a veil of
the covering, and covered the ark
of the testimony; as the Lord commanded Moses.
22 ¶ And he put the table in the
tent of the congregation, upon the
side of the tabernacle northward,
without the veil.
23 And he set the bread in a order
upon it before the Lord; as the Lord
had commanded Moses.
24 ¶ And he put the candlestick in
the tent of the congregation, a over
against the table, on the side of the
tabernacle southward.
25 And he lighted the a lamps before the Lord; as the Lord commanded Moses.
26 ¶ And he put the golden altar

offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt
offering and the a meat offering; as
the Lord commanded Moses.
30 ¶ And he set the laver between
the tent of the congregation and
the altar, and put water there, a to
wash withal.
31 And Moses and Aaron and his
sons washed their hands and their
feet thereat:
32 When they went into the tent
of the congregation, and when
they came near unto the altar, they
washed; as the Lord commanded
Moses.
33 And he reared up the court round
about the tabernacle and the altar,
and set up the hanging of the court
gate. So Moses finished the work.
34 ¶ Then a a cloud covered the tent
of the congregation, and the b glory
of the Lord c filled the d tabernacle.
35 And Moses was not able to enter
into the tent of the congregation,
because the cloud abode thereon,
and the glory of the Lord filled the
tabernacle.
36 And when the a cloud was taken
up from over the tabernacle, the
children of Israel went onward in
all their journeys:
37 But if the cloud were not taken
up, then they a journeyed not till the
day that it was taken up.

was on it by night, in the sight of

all their journeys.

2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man
of you bring an offering unto the
Lord, ye shall bring your offering
of the cattle, even of the herd, and
of the flock.
3 If his offering be a a burnt b sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a
male c without d blemish: he shall
offer it of his own e voluntary will
at the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation before the Lord.
4 And he shall put his a hand upon
the head of the burnt offering; and
it shall be b accepted for him to make
c 
atonement for him.
5 And he shall kill the a bullock
before the Lord: and the priests,
Aaron’s sons, shall bring the blood,
and b  sprinkle the blood round
about upon the altar that is by the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

priest shall burn all on the altar,
to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering
made by fire, of a b sweet savour
unto the Lord.
10 ¶ And if his offering be of the
flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the
goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall
bring it a male a without blemish.
11 And he shall kill it on the side
of the altar northward before the
Lord: and the priests, Aaron’s sons,

the blood thereof shall be wrung
out at the side of the altar:

How offerings of flour with oil and incense are made.
And when any will offer a a meat
offering unto the Lord, his offering
shall be of fine flour; and he shall
pour oil upon it, and put b frankincense thereon:
2 And he shall bring it to Aaron’s
sons the priests: and he shall take
thereout his handful of the flour
thereof, and of the oil thereof, with
all the frankincense thereof; and
the priest shall burn the memorial
of it upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour
unto the Lord:
3 And the remnant of the a meat
offering shall be b Aaron’s and his
sons’: it is a thing most holy of the
offerings of the Lord made by fire.
4 ¶ And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering a baken in
the oven, it shall be b unleavened
cakes of fine flour mingled with
oil, or unleavened wafers anointed
with oil.
5 ¶ And if thy oblation be a meat

blemish before the Lord.

sin, which he hath sinned, a b young

Lord for a c sin d offering.

The people must first make restitution
for sin, then offer a trespass offering,
and thereby gain forgiveness through
atonement made by the priests.
And the Lord spake unto Moses,
saying,
2 If a soul sin, and commit a trespass
against the Lord, and a lie unto his
neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship,
or in a thing taken away by violence,
or hath deceived his neighbour;

sworn falsely; he shall even restore
it in the principal, and shall add the
fifth part more thereto, and give it
unto him to whom it appertaineth,
in the day of his trespass offering.
6 And he shall bring his trespass
offering unto the Lord, a ram without blemish out of the flock, with
thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest:
7 And the priest shall make an
atonement for him before the Lord:
and it shall be forgiven him for any
thing of all that he hath done in

all night unto the morning, and the

the fire hath consumed with the

he shall put them beside the altar.

and carry forth the ashes without

12 And the fire upon the altar

Moses, saying,
20 This is the offering of Aaron
and of his sons, which they shall
offer unto the Lord in the day when
he is anointed; the tenth part of
an ephah of fine flour for a a meat
offering perpetual, half of it in the
morning, and half thereof at night.
21 In a pan it shall be made with

is anointed in his stead shall offer
it: it is a statute for ever unto the
Lord; it shall be wholly burnt.
23 For every meat offering for the
priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall
not be eaten.

Moses, saying,

sons, saying, This is the law of
the sin offering: In the place where
the burnt offering is killed shall the
a 
sin offering be killed before the
Lord: it is most holy.

shall it be eaten, in the court of

Chapter 7
Laws governing various sacrifices are
listed—The children of Israel are forbidden to eat fat or blood—They worship
by sacrifice—Through sacrifice they
gain forgiveness, make vows, consecrate
their property, render thanks, and are
reconciled to God.
Likewise this is the a law of the trespass offering: it is most holy.
2 In the place where they kill the
burnt offering shall they kill the
trespass offering: and the blood
thereof shall he sprinkle round
about upon the altar.
3 And he shall offer of it all the
fat thereof; the rump, and the fat
that covereth the inwards,
4 And the two kidneys, and the
fat that is on them, which is by the
flanks, and the caul that is above
the liver, with the kidneys, it shall
he take away:

upon the altar for an offering made
by fire unto the Lord: it is a trespass offering.
6 Every male among the priests
shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten

for them: the priest that maketh
atonement therewith shall have it.

man’s burnt offering, even the priest
shall have to himself the skin of the
burnt offering which he hath offered.

is dressed in the fryingpan, and in

11 And this is the law of the a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he
shall offer unto the Lord.
12 If he offer it for a a thanksgiving,
then he shall offer with the sacrifice
of b thanksgiving unleavened cakes
mingled with oil, and unleavened

mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.

for his offering leavened bread with

of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be a eaten the same day
that it is offered; he shall not leave

that he offereth his sacrifice: and
on the morrow also the remainder
of it shall be eaten:

of the sacrifice on the third day
shall be burnt with fire.

14 And he brought the bullock for
the a sin offering: and Aaron and his
sons laid their hands upon the head
of the bullock for the sin offering.
15 And he slew it; and Moses took
the blood, and put it upon the a horns
of the altar round about with his
finger, and purified the b altar, and
c 
poured the blood at the bottom of
the altar, and sanctified it, d to make
reconciliation upon it.
16 And he took all the fat that
was upon the inwards, and the caul
above the liver, and the two kidneys,
and their fat, and Moses burned it
upon the altar.
17 But the bullock, and his hide,
his flesh, and his dung, he burnt
with fire without the camp; as the
Lord commanded Moses.
18 ¶ And he brought the ram for
the burnt offering: and Aaron and
his sons laid their hands upon the
head of the ram.
19 And he killed it; and Moses
sprinkled the blood upon the altar
round about.
20 And he cut the ram into pieces;
and Moses burnt the head, and the
pieces, and the fat.
21 And he washed the inwards
and the legs in water; and Moses
burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a
sweet savour, and an offering made
by fire unto the Lord; as the Lord
commanded Moses.
22 ¶ And he brought the other

ram, the ram of consecration: and
Aaron and his sons laid their hands
upon the head of the ram.
23 And he slew it; and Moses took
of the blood of it, and put it upon
the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and upon
the thumb of his right hand, and
upon the great toe of his right foot.
24 And he brought Aaron’s sons,
and Moses put of the blood upon
the tip of their right ear, and upon
the thumbs of their right hands,
and upon the great toes of their
right feet: and Moses a sprinkled the
blood upon the altar round about.
25 And he took the fat, and the
rump, and all the fat that was upon
the inwards, and the caul above the
liver, and the two kidneys, and their
fat, and the right shoulder:
26 And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the
Lord, he took one unleavened cake,
and a cake of oiled bread, and one
wafer, and put them on the fat, and
upon the right shoulder:
27 And he put all upon Aaron’s
hands, and upon his sons’ hands,
and waved them for a wave offering before the Lord.
28 And Moses took them from
off their hands, and burnt them on
the altar upon the burnt offering:
they were consecrations for a sweet
savour: it is an offering made by
fire unto the Lord.
29 And Moses took the breast, and
waved it for a wave offering before
the Lord: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses’ part; as the
Lord commanded Moses.
30 And Moses took of the anointing
oil, and of the blood which was upon
the altar, and a sprinkled it upon
Aaron, and upon his garments, and

garments with him; and b sanctified

sons, and his sons’ garments with
him.
31 ¶ And Moses said unto Aaron
and to his sons, a Boil the flesh at
the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation: and there eat it with
the bread that is in the basket of
consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
32 And that which remaineth of
the flesh and of the bread shall ye
burn with fire.
33 And ye shall not go out of the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven a days, until the
days of your consecration be at an
end: for b seven days shall he consecrate you.
34 As he hath done this day, so the
Lord hath commanded to do, to
make an atonement for you.
35 Therefore a shall ye abide at
the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation day and night seven
days, and keep the b charge of the
Lord, that ye die not: for so I am
commanded.
36 So Aaron and his sons did all
things which the Lord commanded
by the hand of Moses.
Chapter 9
Aaron makes an atonement by sacrifice
for himself and all Israel—He and his
sons offer sacrifices—The glory of the
Lord appears to all—Fire from the Lord
consumes the offerings on the altar.
And it came to pass on the a eighth
day, that Moses called Aaron and
his sons, and the b elders of Israel;
2 And he said unto Aaron, Take
thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering,
without blemish, and offer them
before the Lord.
3 And unto the children of Israel
thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a
kid of the a goats for a sin offering;

and a calf and a lamb, both of the
first year, without blemish, for a
burnt offering;
4 Also a bullock and a ram for
peace offerings, to sacrifice before
the Lord; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the Lord
will a appear unto you.
5 ¶ And they brought that which
Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all
the congregation drew a near and
stood before the Lord.
6 And Moses said, This is the thing
which the Lord commanded that
ye should do: and the a glory of the
Lord shall appear unto you.
7 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go
unto the altar, and offer thy sin
offering, and thy burnt offering,
and make an atonement for thyself,
and for the people: and offer the
offering of the people, and make
an atonement for them; as the Lord
commanded.
8 ¶ Aaron therefore went unto
the altar, and slew the calf of the
sin offering, which was for himself.
9 And the sons of Aaron brought
the blood unto him: and he dipped
his finger in the blood, and put it
upon the a horns of the altar, and
poured out the blood at the bottom
of the altar:
10 But the fat, and the kidneys,
and the caul above the liver of the
sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the Lord commanded Moses.
11 And the flesh and the hide he
burnt with fire without the camp.
12 And he slew the burnt offering;
and Aaron’s sons presented unto
him the blood, which he sprinkled
round about upon the altar.
13 And they presented the burnt
offering unto him, with the pieces
thereof, and the head: and he burnt
them upon the altar.

15 ¶ And he brought the people’s
offering, and took the goat, which
was the sin a offering for the people,
and slew it, and offered it for sin,
as the first.
16 And he brought the burnt off­
ering, and offered it according to
the a manner.
17 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,
and burnt it upon the altar, beside
the burnt sacrifice of the morning.
18 He slew also the bullock and
the ram for a sacrifice of peace off­
erings, which was for the people:
and Aaron’s sons presented unto
him the blood, which he sprinkled
upon the altar round about,
19 And the fat of the bullock and of
the ram, the rump, and that which
covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:
20 And they put the fat upon the
breasts, and he burnt the fat upon
the altar:
21 And the breasts and the right
shoulder Aaron waved for a wave
offering before the Lord; as Moses
commanded.
22 And Aaron lifted up his hand
toward the people, and blessed
them, and came down from offering
of the sin offering, and the burnt
offering, and peace offerings.
23 And Moses and Aaron went
into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed
the people: and the a glory of the
Lord appeared unto all the people.
24 And there came a a fire out from
before the Lord, and consumed
upon the altar the burnt offering

Chapter 10
Nadab and Abihu perform unauthorized
sacrifices and are slain by a fire from
the Lord—Aaron and his other sons are
forbidden to mourn for them—Aaron
and his sons are to abstain from wine
and strong drink—They are to teach
all that the Lord revealed to Moses.
And Nadab and Abihu, the a sons
of Aaron, took either of them his
censer, and put fire therein, and
put incense thereon, and offered
b 
strange fire before the Lord, which
he commanded them not.
2 And there went out a fire from
the Lord, and b devoured them, and
they c died before the Lord.
3 Then Moses said unto Aaron,
This is it that the Lord spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them
that come nigh me, and before all
the people I will be glorified. And
Aaron a held his peace.
4 And Moses called Mishael and
Elzaphan, the sons of a Uzziel the
uncle of Aaron, and said unto them,
Come near, carry your brethren from
before the sanctuary out of the camp.
5 So they went near, and carried
them in their coats out of the camp;
as Moses had said.
6 And Moses said unto Aaron, and
unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,
his sons, Uncover not your a heads,
neither b rend your clothes; lest ye
die, and lest wrath come upon all
the people: but let your brethren,
the whole house of Israel, bewail
the burning which the Lord hath
kindled.
7 And ye shall not go out from
the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation, lest ye die: for the
a 
anointing oil of the Lord is upon
you. And they did according to the
word of Moses.

8 ¶ And the Lord spake unto
Aaron, saying,
9 Do not drink a wine nor b strong
c 
drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee,
when ye go into the tabernacle of
the congregation, lest ye die: it shall
be a statute for ever throughout your
generations:
10 And a that ye may put difference between b holy and unholy,
and between c unclean and d clean;
11 And that ye may a teach the
children of Israel all the statutes
which the Lord hath spoken unto
them by the hand of Moses.
12 ¶ And Moses spake unto Aaron,
and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take
the meat a offering that remaineth
of the offerings of the Lord made
by fire, and b eat it without leaven
beside the altar: for it is most holy:
13 And ye shall a eat it in the holy
place, because it is thy due, and
thy sons’ due, of the sacrifices of
the Lord made by fire: for so I am
commanded.
14 And the a wave breast and heave
shoulder shall ye b eat in a clean
place; thou, and thy sons, and thy
daughters with thee: for they be thy
due, and thy sons’ due, which are
given out of the sacrifices of peace
offerings of the children of Israel.
15 a The heave shoulder and the
wave breast shall they bring with
the offerings made by fire of the fat,
to wave it for a wave offering before
the Lord; and it shall be thine, and
thy sons’ with thee, b by a statute for
ever; as the Lord hath commanded.

behold, it was burnt: and he was
angry with Eleazar and Ithamar,

alive, saying,
17 Wherefore have ye not eaten the
sin offering in the holy place, seeing
it is most holy, and God hath given
it you to a bear the iniquity of the
congregation, to make atonement
for them before the Lord?
18 Behold, the blood of it was not
brought in within the holy place: ye
should indeed have eaten it in the
holy place, as I commanded.
19 And Aaron said unto Moses,
Behold, this day have they offered
their sin offering and their burnt
offering before the Lord; and such
things have a befallen me: and if I
had eaten the sin offering to day,
should it have been b accepted in
the sight of the Lord?

was content.

6 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the

7 And the swine, though he divide

he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.
8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat,
and their carcase shall ye not touch;
they are unclean to you.
9 ¶ These shall ye eat of all that are
in the waters: whatsoever hath fins
and scales in the waters, in the seas,
and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.
10 And all that have not fins and
scales in the seas, and in the rivers,
of all that move in the waters, and
of any living thing which is in the
waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:
11 They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of
their flesh, but ye shall have their
carcases in abomination.
12 Whatsoever hath no fins nor

13 ¶ And these are they which ye
shall have in abomination among

they are an abomination: the eagle,

after his kind;

18 And the swan, and the pelican,
and the gier eagle,

kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.
20 All fowls that creep, going upon
all four, shall be an abomination
unto you.

21 Yet these may ye eat of every
flying creeping thing that goeth
upon all four, which have legs above
their feet, to leap withal upon the
earth;
22 Even these of them ye may eat;
the a locust after his kind, and the
bald locust after his kind, and the
beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.
23 But all other flying creeping
things, which have four feet, shall
be an abomination unto you.
24 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be a unclean until
the even.
25 And whosoever beareth ought
of the carcase of them shall wash
his clothes, and be unclean until
the even.
26 The carcases of every beast
which divideth the hoof, and is not
clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud,
are unclean unto you: every one that
toucheth them shall be unclean.
27 And whatsoever goeth upon his
paws, among all manner of beasts
that go on all four, those are unclean
unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.
28 And he that beareth the carcase
of them shall wash his clothes, and
be unclean until the even: they are
unclean unto you.
29 ¶ These also shall be a unclean
unto you among the creeping things
that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise
after his kind,
30 And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail,
and the mole.
31 These are unclean to you among
all that creep: whosoever doth touch
them, when they be dead, shall be
unclean until the even.
32 And upon whatsoever any of
them, when they are dead, doth
fall, it shall be unclean; whether it
be any vessel of wood, or raiment,

it be, wherein any work is done, it
must be put into water, and it shall

whereinto any of them falleth,
whatsoever is in it shall be unclean;
and ye shall a break it.
34 Of all meat which may be eaten,
that on which such water cometh
shall be unclean: and all drink that
may be drunk in every such vessel
shall be unclean.
35 And every thing whereupon any
part of their carcase falleth shall
be unclean; whether it be a oven, or
ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: for they are unclean, and
shall be unclean unto you.
36 Nevertheless a a fountain or pit,
wherein there is plenty of water, shall
be clean: but that which toucheth
their carcase shall be unclean.
37 And if any part of their carcase
fall upon any sowing seed which is
to be sown, it shall be clean.
38 But if any water be put upon
the seed, and any part of their carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean
unto you.
39 And if any beast, of which ye
may eat, die; he that toucheth the
carcase thereof shall be unclean
until the even.
40 And he that eateth of the a carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and
be unclean until the even: he also
that beareth the carcase of it shall
wash his clothes, and be unclean
until the even.
41 And every creeping thing that
creepeth upon the earth shall be an
abomination; it shall not be eaten.
42 Whatsoever goeth upon the
belly, and whatsoever goeth upon
all four, or a whatsoever hath more
feet among all creeping things that
creep upon the earth, them ye shall
not eat; for they are an abomination.

with any manner of creeping thing
that creepeth upon the earth.
45 For I am the Lord that bringeth
you up out of the land of Egypt, to

and of every creature that creepeth
upon the earth:

Laws and tokens are revealed for discerning and controlling leprosy—Leprous garments are to be burnt.
And the Lord spake unto Moses
and Aaron, saying,
2 When a man shall have in the
skin of his flesh a a rising, a scab,
or bright spot, and it be in the skin
of his flesh like the plague of b leprosy; then he shall be brought unto

pronounce him unclean.
4 If the bright spot be white in the
skin of his flesh, and in sight be not
deeper than the skin, and the hair
thereof be not turned white; then

the priest shall pronounce him
clean: it is but a scab: and he shall
wash his clothes, and be clean.
7 But if the scab spread much
abroad in the skin, after that he
hath been seen of the priest for his

cleansing, he shall be seen of the
priest again:
8 And if the priest see that, behold,
the scab spreadeth in the skin, then
the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.
9 ¶ When the plague of leprosy is
in a man, then he shall be brought
unto the priest;

and, behold, if the rising be white
in the skin, and it have turned the
hair white, and there be quick raw

18 ¶ The flesh also, in which, even
in the skin thereof, was a boil, and
is healed,
19 And in the place of the boil
there be a white rising, or a bright
spot, white, and somewhat reddish,
and it be shewed to the priest;
20 And if, when the priest seeth
it, behold, a it be in sight lower than
the skin, and the hair thereof be
turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague
of leprosy broken out of the boil.
21 But if the priest look on it,
and, behold, there be no white hairs
therein, a and if it be not lower than
the skin, but be somewhat dark; then
the priest shall shut him up seven
days:
22 And if it spread much abroad in

23 But if the bright spot stay in

behold, there be no white hair in the

28 And if the bright spot stay in
his place, and spread not in the skin,
but it be somewhat dark; it is a a rising of the burning, and the priest
shall pronounce him clean: for it
is an inflammation of the burning.
29 ¶ If a man or woman have a
plague upon the head or the beard;
30 Then the priest shall see the
plague: and, behold, if it be in sight
deeper than the skin; and there be in
it a yellow thin hair; then the priest
shall pronounce him unclean: it is
a dry scall, even a leprosy upon the
head or beard.
31 And if the priest look on the
plague of the scall, and, behold,
it be not in sight deeper than the
skin, and that there is no black hair
in it; then the priest shall shut up
him that hath the plague of the scall
seven days:
32 And in the seventh day the
priest shall look on the plague: and,
behold, if the scall spread not, and
there be in it no yellow hair, and the
scall be not in sight deeper than
the skin;
33 He shall be shaven, but the scall
shall he not shave; and the priest
shall shut up him that hath the scall

priest shall look on the scall: and,
behold, if the scall be not spread
in the skin, nor be in sight deeper
than the skin; then the priest shall
pronounce him clean: and he shall
wash his clothes, and be clean.
35 But if the scall spread much in
the skin after his cleansing;
36 Then the priest shall look on
him: and, behold, if the scall be
spread in the skin, the priest shall not
seek for yellow hair; he is unclean.

38 ¶ If a man also or a woman have
in the skin of their flesh bright
spots, even white bright spots;
39 Then the priest shall look: and,
behold, if the bright spots in the
skin of their flesh be darkish white;
it is a a freckled spot that groweth
in the skin; he is clean.
40 And the man whose hair is
fallen off his head, he is bald; yet
is he clean.
41 And he that hath his hair fallen
off from the part of his head toward
his face, he is forehead bald: yet is
he clean.
42 And if there be in the bald head,
or bald forehead, a white reddish
sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in
his bald head, or his bald forehead.
43 Then the priest shall look upon
it: and, behold, if the rising of the
sore be white reddish in his bald
head, or in his bald forehead, as
the leprosy appeareth in the skin
of the flesh;
44 He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce
him utterly unclean; his plague is
in his head.
45 And the leper in whom the
plague is, his clothes shall be a rent,
and his head bare, and b he shall put
a covering upon his upper lip, and
shall cry, Unclean, unclean.
46 All the days wherein the plague
shall be in him he shall be defiled;

50 And the priest shall look upon
the plague, and shut up it that
hath the plague seven days:
51 And he shall look on the plague
on the seventh day: if the plague be
spread in the garment, either in the
warp, or in the woof, or in a skin,
or in any work that is made of skin;
the plague is a a fretting leprosy; it
is unclean.
52 He shall therefore burn that
garment, whether warp or woof, in
woollen or in linen, or any thing of
skin, wherein the plague is: for it is
a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt
in the fire.
53 And if the priest shall look, and,
behold, the plague be not spread in
the garment, either in the warp, or
in the woof, or in any thing of skin;
54 Then the priest shall command
that they wash the thing wherein the
plague is, and he shall a shut it up
seven days more:
55 And the priest shall look on the
plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed
his colour, and the plague be not
spread; it is unclean; thou shalt
burn it in the fire; a it is fret inward,
whether it be bare within or without.
56 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark
after the washing of it; then he shall
rend it out of the garment, or out
of the skin, or out of the warp, or
out of the woof:
57 And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the
woof, or in any thing of skin; it is
a spreading plague: thou shalt burn
that wherein the plague is with fire.

or any thing of skins, to pronounce
it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.
Chapter 14
Laws, rites, and sacrifices are revealed
for cleansing lepers, their garments, and
leprous houses.
And the Lord spake unto Moses,
saying,
2 This shall be the law of the a leper
in the day of his cleansing: He shall
be brought unto the b priest:
3 And the priest shall go forth out
of the camp; and the priest shall
look, and, behold, if the plague of
leprosy be a healed in the leper;
4 Then shall the priest command to
take for him that is to be cleansed
two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and a scarlet, and hyssop:
5 And the priest shall command
that one of the birds be killed in an
earthen vessel over running water:
6 As for the living bird, he shall
take it, and the cedar wood, and the
scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall
dip them and the living bird in the
blood of the bird that was killed
over the running water:
7 And he shall sprinkle upon him
that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the
living bird loose into the open field.
8 And he that is to be cleansed
shall wash his clothes, and a shave
off all his hair, and wash himself
in water, that he may be clean: and
after that he shall come into the
camp, and shall tarry abroad out
of his tent seven days.
9 But it shall be on the seventh
day, that he shall shave all his hair
off his head and his beard and his
eyebrows, even all his hair he shall

clothes, also he shall wash his flesh
in water, and he shall be clean.
10 And on the eighth day he shall
take two he lambs without blemish,
and a one ewe lamb of the first year
without blemish, and three tenth
deals of fine flour for a meat offering,
mingled with oil, and one log of oil.
11 And the priest that maketh him
clean shall present the man that is
to be made clean, and those things,
before the Lord, at the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation:
12 And the priest shall take one
he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil,
and wave them for a wave offering
before the Lord:
13 And he shall slay the lamb in
the place where he shall kill the sin

the holy place: for as the sin offering is the priest’s, so is the trespass
offering: it is most holy:
14 And the priest shall take some
of the blood of the trespass offering,
and the priest shall put it upon the
tip of the right ear of him that is to
be cleansed, and upon the thumb of
his right hand, and upon the great
toe of his right foot:

of the log of oil, and pour it into the
palm of his own left hand:
16 And the priest shall dip his right
finger in the oil that is in his left hand,
and shall sprinkle of the oil with his
finger seven times before the Lord:
17 And of the rest of the oil that
is in his hand shall the priest put
upon the tip of the right ear of him
that is to be cleansed, and upon the
thumb of his right hand, and upon
the great toe of his right foot, upon
the blood of the trespass offering:

that is in the priest’s hand he shall

behold, if the plague be spread in

that they take away the stones in
which the plague is, and they shall
cast them into an unclean place
without the city:
41 And he shall cause the house
to be scraped within round about,
and they shall pour out the dust
that they scrape off without the
city into an unclean place:
42 And they shall take other stones,
and put them in the place of those
stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.
43 And if the plague come again,

that he hath a taken away the stones,
and after he hath scraped the house,
and after it is plastered;

house all the while that it is shut
up shall be unclean until the even.

shall wash his clothes; and he that

clothes.
48 And if the priest shall come in,

plague hath not spread in the house,
after the house was plastered: then
the priest shall pronounce the house
clean, because the plague is healed.
49 And he shall take to a cleanse the
house two birds, and cedar wood,

How and when Aaron must enter the
holy place is explained—Sacrifices are
offered to reconcile Israel to God—The
scapegoat carries away the sins of the
people—The sins of all Israel are forgiven on the Day of Atonement.
And the Lord spake unto Moses
after the death of the two a sons of
Aaron, when they offered before
the Lord, and died;
2 And the Lord said unto Moses,
Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that
he come not at all times into the
a 
holy place within the b veil before
the mercy seat, which is upon the
ark; that he die not: for I will c appear in the cloud upon the mercy
seat.
3 Thus shall Aaron come into the
holy place: with a young bullock

for a sin offering, and a ram for a
burnt offering.
4 He shall put on the holy linen
coat, and he shall have the linen
breeches upon his flesh, and shall
be girded with a linen girdle, and
with the linen a mitre shall he be
attired: these are holy garments;
therefore shall he wash his flesh in
water, and so put them on.
5 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two
kids of the goats for a sin offering,
and one ram for a burnt offering.
6 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for
himself, and make an atonement
for himself, and for his house.
7 And he shall take the two goats,
and present them before the Lord
at the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation.
8 And Aaron shall cast lots upon
the two goats; one lot for the Lord,
and the other lot for the scapegoat.
9 And Aaron shall bring the goat
upon which the Lord’s lot fell, and
offer him for a sin a offering.
10 But the goat, on which the lot
fell to be the scapegoat, shall be
presented alive before the Lord, to
make an atonement with him, and
to let him go for a scapegoat into
the wilderness.
11 And Aaron shall bring the
bullock of the sin offering, which
is for himself, and shall make an
atonement for himself, and for his
house, and shall kill the bullock
of the sin offering which is for
himself:
12 And he shall take a a censer full
of burning coals of fire from off
the altar before the Lord, and his
hands full of sweet incense beaten
small, and bring it within the veil:
13 And he shall put the a incense
upon the fire before the Lord, that
the cloud of the incense may cover

the mercy seat that is b upon the
testimony, that he die not:
14 And he shall take of the a blood
of the bullock, and sprinkle it with
his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat
shall he sprinkle of the blood with
his finger seven times.
15 ¶ Then shall he kill the goat of
the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the
veil, and do with that blood as he
did with the blood of the bullock,
and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat,
and before the mercy seat:
16 And he shall make an atonement
for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel,
and because of their a transgressions
in all their sins: and so shall he do
for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them
in the midst of their uncleanness.
17 And there shall be no man in
the tabernacle of the congregation
when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come
out, and have made an atonement
for himself, and for his household,
and for all the congregation of Israel.
18 And he shall go out unto the
altar that is before the Lord, and
make an atonement for it; and shall
take of the blood of the bullock,
and of the blood of the goat, and
put it upon the a horns of the altar
round about.
19 And he shall sprinkle of the
blood upon it with his finger seven
times, and cleanse it, and hallow it
from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.
20 ¶ And when he hath made an
end of reconciling the holy place,
and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring
the live goat:

hands upon the head of the live

iniquities of the children of Israel,
and all their transgressions in all

head of the goat, and shall send him
away by the hand of a c fit man into
the wilderness:
22 And the goat shall a bear upon
him all their b iniquities unto a land
not inhabited: and he shall let go
the goat in the wilderness.
23 And Aaron shall come into
the tabernacle of the congregation,
and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he
went into the holy a place, and shall
leave them there:
24 And he shall wash his flesh with
water a in the holy place, and put
on his garments, and come forth,
and offer his burnt offering, and
the burnt offering of the people,
and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.
25 And the fat of the sin offering
shall he burn upon the altar.
26 And he that let go the goat for
the scapegoat shall wash his clothes,
and bathe his flesh in water, and
afterward come into the camp.
27 And the bullock for the sin off­
ering, and the goat for the sin off­
ering, whose blood was brought
in to make atonement in the holy
place, shall one carry forth without
the camp; and they shall burn in
the fire their skins, and their flesh,
and their dung.
28 And he that burneth them
shall wash his clothes, and bathe
his flesh in water, and afterward
he shall come into the camp.

for ever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the
month, ye shall a afflict your souls,

30 For on that day shall the priest
make an atonement for you, to
cleanse you, that ye may be clean
from all your sins before the Lord.
31 It shall be a a sabbath of rest unto
you, and ye shall afflict your souls,
by a statute for ever.
32 And the a priest, whom he shall
b 
anoint, and whom he shall c consecrate to minister in the priest’s office in his father’s stead, shall make
the atonement, and shall put on the
linen clothes, even the holy garments:
33 And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and
he shall make an atonement for the

for the altar, and he shall make an
atonement for the priests, and for

34 And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an
atonement for the children of Israel
for all their sins once a year. And
he did as the Lord commanded
Moses.
Chapter 17
Sacrifices are to be offered only to the
Lord at the tabernacle of the congregation—Israel is forbidden to sacrifice
to devils—All eating of blood is forbidden—Shedding of blood is required for
an atonement for sins.
And the Lord spake unto Moses,
saying,
2 Speak unto Aaron, and unto
his sons, and unto all the children
of Israel, and say unto them; This
is the thing which the Lord hath
commanded, saying,

house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or
lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that
killeth it out of the camp,

of the Lord; blood shall be imputed
unto that man; he hath shed blood;
and that man shall be cut off from
among his people:
5 To the end that the children of
Israel may bring their sacrifices,
which they offer in the open field,
even that they may bring them unto
the Lord, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto
the priest, and offer them for peace
a 
offerings unto the Lord.
6 And the priest shall sprinkle the
blood upon the altar of the Lord
at the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation, and burn the fat for
a sweet savour unto the Lord.
7 And they shall no more offer
their sacrifices unto devils, after
whom they have gone a a whoring.
This shall be a statute for ever unto
them throughout their generations.
8 ¶ And thou shalt say unto them,
Whatsoever man there be of the house
of Israel, or of the strangers which
sojourn among you, that a offereth
a burnt offering or sacrifice,
9 And bringeth it not unto the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the Lord;
even that man shall be cut off from

be of the house of Israel, or of the
strangers that sojourn among you,
that eateth any manner of blood; I
will even set my a face against that
soul that eateth b blood, and will
cut him off from among his people.

Israel shall not live as the Egyptians

forbidden—Homosexual behavior and
other sexual perversions are an abomination—The land expels those nations
that practice sexual abominations.

saying,

2 Again, thou shalt say to the

strangers that sojourn in Israel, that

he shall surely be put to death: the

3 And I will set my face against

4 And if the people of the land do
any ways hide their eyes from the
man, when he giveth of his seed
unto Molech, and a kill him not:
5 Then I will set my a face against

The priests are to be holy—The high

of Aaron with physical blemishes may
not offer the bread of God upon the altar.
And the Lord said unto Moses,
Speak unto the priests the sons of
Aaron, and say unto them, There
shall none be defiled for the a dead
b 
among his people:
2 But for his kin, that is near unto
him, that is, for his mother, and for

upon their head, neither shall they

deals: they shall be of fine flour;
they shall be baken with b leaven;
they are the firstfruits unto the Lord.
18 And ye shall offer with the
bread seven a lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young
bullock, and two rams: they shall be
for a burnt offering unto the Lord,
with their meat offering, and their
drink offerings, even an offering
made by fire, of sweet savour unto
the Lord.
19 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid
of the goats for a sin offering, and
two lambs of the first year for a
sacrifice of peace offerings.
20 And the priest shall wave them
with the bread of the firstfruits for
a wave offering before the Lord,
with the two lambs: they shall be
holy to the Lord for the priest.

Moses, saying,
34 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of
this a seventh month shall be the
b 
feast of c tabernacles for seven days
unto the Lord.
35 On the first day shall be an holy

ye shall keep a feast unto the Lord

shall be a sabbath.
40 And ye shall take you on the

A perpetual fire is to burn outside the

9 And it shall be Aaron’s and his

him of the offerings of the Lord
made by fire by a perpetual statute.
10 ¶ And the son of an Israelitish
woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children
of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel
strove together in the camp;
11 And the Israelitish woman’s
son a blasphemed the name of the
Lord, and cursed. And they brought
him unto Moses: (and his mother’s
name was Shelomith, the daughter
of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)
12 And they put him a in ward,
that the b mind of the Lord might
be shewed them.
13 And the Lord spake unto Moses,
saying,
14 Bring forth him that hath
cursed without the camp; and let
all that heard him lay their hands
upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
15 And thou shalt speak unto the
children of Israel, saying, Whosoever
a 
curseth his God shall bear his sin.
16 And he that a blasphemeth the
name of the Lord, he shall surely be
put to death, and all the congregation
shall certainly stone him: as well
the stranger, as he that is born in the
land, when he blasphemeth the name
of the Lord, shall be put to death.

shall surely be put to b death.

21 And he that killeth a beast, he

22 Ye shall have one manner of

23 ¶ And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring
forth him that had cursed out of the
camp, and stone him with stones.
And the children of Israel did as
the Lord commanded Moses.
Chapter 25
Each seventh year is to be kept as a
sabbath year—Each fiftieth year is to
be one of jubilee, in which liberty is proclaimed throughout the land—Laws are
revealed for the sale and redemption of
lands, houses, and servants—The land
is the Lord’s, as are the servants—Usury
is forbidden.
And the Lord spake unto Moses in
mount Sinai, saying,
2 Speak unto the children of Israel,
and say unto them, When ye come
into the land which I give you, then
shall the land keep a a sabbath unto
the Lord.
3 Six years thou shalt sow thy field,
and six years thou shalt prune thy

thereof;

6 And the sabbath of the land shall

thy servant, and for thy maid, and
for thy hired servant, and for thy
stranger that sojourneth with thee,
7 And for thy cattle, and for the
beast that are in thy land, shall all
the increase thereof be a meat.
8 ¶ And thou shalt number seven
sabbaths of years unto thee, seven
times seven years; and the space of
the seven sabbaths of years shall
be unto thee forty and nine years.
9 Then shalt thou a cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the
tenth day of the seventh month, in
the day of atonement shall ye make
the trumpet sound throughout all
your land.
10 And ye shall a hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim b liberty
throughout all the land unto all
the inhabitants thereof: it shall be
a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession,
and ye shall return every man unto
his c family.
11 A a jubilee shall that fiftieth
year be unto you: ye shall not sow,
neither reap that which groweth of
itself in it, nor gather the grapes in

16 According to the a multitude of

number of the years of the fruits

17 Ye shall not therefore a oppress

God: for I am the Lord your God.
18 ¶ Wherefore ye shall a do my
statutes, and keep my b judgments,
and do them; and ye shall dwell in
the land in safety.
19 And the land shall yield her
fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and
dwell therein in safety.

we eat the a seventh year? behold,
we shall not sow, nor gather in our
increase:

it shall bring forth fruit for three
years.

year, and eat yet of old fruit until

sold it; that he may return unto his
possession.
28 But if he be not able to restore it
to him, then that which is sold shall
remain in the hand of him that hath
bought it until the year of jubilee:
and in the jubilee it shall a go out, and
he shall b return unto his possession.
29 And if a man sell a dwelling
house in a walled city, then he may
redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may
he redeem it.
30 And if it be not redeemed within
the space of a full year, then the
house that is in the walled city shall
be established for ever to him that
bought it throughout his generations:
it shall not go out in the jubilee.
31 But the houses of the villages
which have no wall round about
them shall be counted as the fields of
the country: they may be redeemed,
and they shall go out in the jubilee.
32 Notwithstanding the cities of
the Levites, and the houses of the
cities of their possession, may the
Levites redeem at any time.
33 And if a man purchase of the
Levites, then the house that was
sold, and the city of his possession,
shall go out in the year of jubilee:
for the houses of the cities of the
Levites are their possession among
the children of Israel.
34 But the a field of the b suburbs
of their cities may not be sold; for
it is their perpetual possession.
35 ¶ And if thy brother be waxen

thee; then thou shalt relieve him:
yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.

sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a b bondservant:
40 But as an hired servant, and as
a sojourner, he shall be with thee,
and shall serve thee unto the year
of jubilee:
41 And then shall he depart from
thee, both he and his children with
him, and shall return unto his own
family, and unto the possession of
his fathers shall he return.
42 For they are my servants, which
I brought forth out of the land of
Egypt: they shall not be sold as

43 Thou shalt not rule over him
with rigour; but shalt a fear thy God.
44 Both thy bondmen, and thy

shall be of the a heathen that are

the children of Israel, ye shall not

may redeem him; or if he be able,
he may redeem himself.
50 And he shall reckon with him
that bought him from the year that
he was sold to him unto the year
of jubilee: and the price of his sale
shall be according unto the number
of years, according to the time of an

51 If there be yet many years behind,
according unto them he shall give

unto desolation, and b I will not smell

32 And I will bring the a land into
desolation: and your enemies which
dwell therein shall be astonished
at it.
33 And I will a scatter you among
the heathen, and will draw out a
sword after you: and your land shall
be b desolate, and your cities waste.
34 Then shall the land enjoy her

sabbaths, as long as it lieth deso­

land; even then shall the land rest,

35 As long as it lieth desolate it
shall rest; because it did not rest
in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt
upon it.
36 And upon them that are left
alive of you I will send a faintness
into their hearts in the lands of
their enemies; and the sound of a
shaken leaf shall chase them; and
they shall flee, as fleeing from a

none pursueth.
37 And they shall fall one upon

punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised
my judgments, and because their
soul abhorred my statutes.
44 And yet for all that, when they
be in the land of their a enemies, I
will not cast them away, neither will
I abhor them, to b destroy them utterly, and to break my c covenant with
them: for I am the Lord their God.
45 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out
of the land of Egypt in the a sight of

46 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the Lord
made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by

persons shall be for the Lord by thy
estimation.
3 And thy estimation shall be of
the male from twenty years old even
unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
4 And if it be a female, then thy
estimation shall be thirty shekels.
5 And if it be from five years old
even unto twenty years old, then
thy estimation shall be of the male
twenty shekels, and for the female
ten shekels.
6 And if it be from a month old
even unto five years old, then thy
estimation shall be of the male five
shekels of silver, and for the female
thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.
7 And if it be from sixty years old
and above; if it be a male, then thy
estimation shall be fifteen shekels,
and for the female ten shekels.
8 But if he be poorer than thy
estimation, then he shall present
himself before the priest, and the
priest shall value him; according
to his ability that vowed shall the
priest value him.
9 And if it be a beast, whereof men
bring an offering unto the Lord, all
that any man giveth of such unto
the Lord shall be holy.
10 He shall not alter it, nor change
it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a
good: and if he shall at all change
beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.
11 And if it be any unclean beast,
of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the Lord, then he shall
present the beast before the priest:
12 And the priest shall value it,
whether it be good or bad: as thou
valuest it, who art the priest, so
shall it be.
13 But if he will at all redeem it,
then he shall add a fifth part thereof
unto thy estimation.
14 ¶ And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the
Lord, then the priest shall estimate

it, whether it be good or bad: as the
priest shall estimate it, so shall it
stand.
15 And if he that sanctified it will
redeem his house, then he shall add
the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.
16 And if a man shall sanctify unto
the Lord some part of a field of his
possession, then thy estimation shall
be according to the seed thereof: an
a 
homer of barley seed shall be valued
at fifty shekels of silver.
17 If he sanctify his field from the
year of jubilee, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
18 But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall
reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even
unto the year of the jubilee, and it
shall be abated from thy estimation.
19 And if he that sanctified the
field will in any wise redeem it,
then he shall add the fifth part of
the money of thy estimation unto
it, and it shall be assured to him.
20 And if he will not redeem the
field, or if he have sold the field
to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.
21 But the field, when it goeth out
in the jubilee, shall be holy unto the
Lord, as a field a devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest’s.
22 And if a man sanctify unto the
Lord a field which he hath bought,
which is not of the fields of his
possession;
23 Then the priest shall reckon
unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the jubilee: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing
unto the Lord.
24 In the year of the jubilee the
field shall a return unto him of whom
it was bought, even to him to whom
the possession of the land did belong.
25 And all thy estimations shall
be according to the a shekel of the
sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be
the shekel.

Leviticus 27:26–Numbers 1:3
26 ¶ Only the a firstling of the
beasts, which should be the Lord’s
firstling, no man shall sanctify it;
whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the
Lord’s.
27 And if it be of an unclean beast,
then he shall redeem it according
to thine estimation, and shall add
a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be
not redeemed, then it shall be sold
according to thy estimation.
28 Notwithstanding no devoted
thing, that a man shall devote unto
the Lord of all that he hath, both
of man and beast, and of the field
of his possession, shall be a sold or
redeemed: every devoted thing is
most holy unto the Lord.
29 None devoted, which shall be
devoted of men, shall be redeemed;
but shall surely be put to death.

190
30 And all the a tithe of the land,
whether of the seed of the land, or of
the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s:
it is holy unto the Lord.
31 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall
add thereto the fifth part thereof.
32 And concerning the tithe of the
herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the a rod, the
tenth shall be holy unto the Lord.
33 He shall not search whether
it be good or bad, neither shall he
change it: and if he change it at
all, then both it and the change
thereof shall be holy; it shall not
be redeemed.
34 These are the commandments,
which the Lord commanded Moses
for the children of Israel in mount
Sinai.

numbered of the children of Israel by
the house of their fathers: all those
that were numbered of the camps
throughout their hosts were six hundred thousand and three thousand
and five hundred and fifty.
33 But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel;
as the Lord commanded Moses.
34 And the children of Israel did
according to all that the Lord commanded Moses: so they a pitched
by their b standards, and so they
set forward, every one after their
families, according to the house of
their fathers.
Chapter 3
Aaron and his sons minister in the
priest’s office—The Levites are chosen
to do the service of the tabernacle—They
are the Lord’s, replacing the firstborn
of all families of Israel—Their number,
charge, and service are given.
These also are the generations of
Aaron and Moses in the day that the
Lord spake with Moses in mount
Sinai.
2 And these are the names of the
sons of a Aaron; Nadab the firstborn,
and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

of Aaron, the a priests which were

no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest’s office
in the sight of Aaron their father.
5 ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
6 Bring the tribe of a Levi near,
and present them before Aaron
the priest, that they may minister
unto him.
7 And they shall keep his a charge,
and the charge of the whole b congregation before the tabernacle of
the congregation, to do the service
of the tabernacle.
8 And they shall keep all the a instruments of the tabernacle of the
congregation, and the charge of
the children of Israel, to do the

service of the c tabernacle.
9 And thou shalt give the a Levites
unto b Aaron and to his sons: they
are wholly given unto him out of
the children of Israel.
10 And thou shalt appoint a Aaron
and his b sons, and they shall wait
on their priest’s office: and c the

11 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

Levites from among the children of
Israel instead of all the a firstborn
that openeth the matrix among the
children of Israel: therefore the
Levites shall be mine;
13 Because all the firstborn are
mine; for on the day that I smote all
the firstborn in the land of Egypt I
a 
hallowed unto me all the firstborn
in Israel, both man and beast: mine
shall they be: I am the Lord.

money of them that were over and

the Levites:

of Israel took he the money; a thousand three hundred and threescore

When the camps of Israel move, Aaron
and his sons cover the holy things in the
tabernacle—The Levites of the families
of Kohath, Gershon, and Merari carry
the burden of the tabernacle.
And the Lord spake unto Moses
and unto Aaron, saying,
2 Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi,
after their families, by the house
of their fathers,
3 From a thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all
that enter into the host, to do the

spread over it a cloth wholly of blue,
and shall put in the staves thereof.

15 And when Aaron and his sons
have made an end of covering the

the sanctuary, as the camp is to set
forward; after that, the sons of a Kohath shall come to b bear it: but they
shall not c touch d any e holy thing,
lest they die. These things are the

the son of Aaron the priest pertaineth
the oil for the light, and the sweet
incense, and the a daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the
oversight of all the tabernacle, and
of all that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof.
17 ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
18 Cut ye not off the tribe of the
families of the Kohathites from
among the Levites:
19 But thus do unto them, that
they may live, and not die, when
they approach unto the most holy
things: Aaron and his sons shall go
in, and appoint them every one to
his service and to his burden:
20 But they shall not go in to see
when the holy things are covered,
lest they die.
21 ¶ And the Lord spake unto
Moses, saying,
22 Take also the sum of the sons
of Gershon, throughout the houses
of their fathers, by their families;
23 From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt
thou number them; all that enter
in to perform the service, to do the

30 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt
thou number them, every one that

4 And the children of Israel did
so, and put them out without the
camp: as the Lord spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.
5 ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
6 Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall
commit any a sin that men commit,
to do a trespass against the Lord,
and that person be guilty;
7 Then they shall a confess their
sin which they have done: and he
shall b recompense his trespass with
the principal thereof, and add unto
it the fifth part thereof, and give
it unto him against whom he hath
trespassed.
8 But if the man have no a kinsman
to recompense the trespass unto, let
the trespass be recompensed unto the
Lord, even to the priest; beside the
ram of the atonement, whereby an
atonement shall be made for him.
9 And every offering of all the
holy things of the children of Israel,
which they bring unto the priest,
shall be his.
10 And every man’s hallowed
things shall be his: whatsoever any
man giveth the priest, it shall be his.
11 ¶ And the Lord spake unto
Moses, saying,
12 Speak unto the children of
Israel, and say unto them, If any
man’s wife go aside, and commit a
trespass against him,
13 And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes
of her husband, and a be kept close,
and she be defiled, and there be no
witness against her, neither she be
b 
taken with the manner;
14 And the spirit of jealousy come

wife, and she be defiled: or if the

15 Then shall the man bring his
wife unto the priest, and he shall
bring her offering for her, the tenth
part of an ephah of barley meal; he
shall pour no oil upon it, nor put
frankincense thereon; for it is an
offering of jealousy, an offering of
memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
16 And the priest shall bring her
near, and set her before the Lord:

water in an earthen vessel; and of
the dust that is in the floor of the
tabernacle the priest shall take, and
put it into the water:
18 And the priest shall set the
woman before the Lord, and uncover the woman’s head, and put the
offering of memorial in her hands,
which is the jealousy offering: and
the priest shall have in his hand
the bitter water that causeth the
curse:
19 And the priest shall charge her
by an oath, and say unto the woman,
If no man have lain with thee, and
if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of
thy husband, be thou free from this
bitter water that causeth the curse:
20 But if thou hast gone aside to
another instead of thy husband, and
if thou be defiled, and some man
have lain with thee beside thine
husband:
21 Then the priest shall charge the
woman with an oath of cursing, and
the priest shall say unto the woman,
The Lord make thee a curse and an
oath among thy people, when the
Lord doth make thy thigh to a rot,
and thy belly to swell;
22 And this water that causeth
the curse shall go into thy bowels,
to make thy belly to swell, and thy

to drink the bitter water that

that causeth the curse shall enter

27 And when he hath made her to
drink the water, then it shall come
to pass, that, if she be defiled, and
have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth
the curse shall enter into her, and
become bitter, and her belly shall
swell, and her thigh shall rot: and
the woman shall be a curse among
her people.
28 And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall
be free, and shall conceive seed.
29 This is the law of jealousies,
when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband, and is defiled;
30 Or when the spirit of jealousy
cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shall set the
woman before the Lord, and the
priest shall execute upon her all
this law.
31 Then shall the man be guiltless
from iniquity, and this woman shall
bear her iniquity.
Chapter 6
The law of the Nazarite is explained,
whereby the children of Israel may
consecrate themselves to the Lord by a

And the Lord spake unto Moses,
saying,
2 Speak unto the children of Israel,
and say unto them, When either
man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a a vow of a b Nazarite,
to separate themselves unto the Lord:
3 He shall separate himself from
a 
wine and b strong c drink, and shall
drink no vinegar of wine, or vin­
egar of strong drink, neither shall
he drink any d liquor of grapes, nor
eat moist grapes, or dried.
4 All the days of his separation
shall he eat nothing that is made
of the a vine tree, from the kernels
even to the husk.
5 All the days of the vow of his
separation there shall no a razor
come upon his head: until the days
be fulfilled, in the which he separateth himself unto the Lord, he shall
be holy, and shall let the locks of
the hair of his head grow.
6 All the days that he separateth
himself unto the Lord he shall come
at no dead body.
7 He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother,
for his brother, or for his sister, when
they die: because the consecration
of his God is upon his head.
8 All the days of his separation he
is holy unto the Lord.
9 And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled
the head of his consecration; then
he shall shave his head in the day
of his cleansing, on the a seventh
day shall he shave it.
10 And on the eighth day he shall
bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of
the a tabernacle of the congregation:

one for a sin a offering, and the other

sinned by b the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.
12 And he shall consecrate unto
the Lord the days of his separation,
and shall bring a lamb of the first
year for a trespass offering: but the
days that were before shall be lost,
because his separation was defiled.
13 ¶ And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation
are a fulfilled: he shall be brought
unto the door of the tabernacle of
the congregation:
14 And he shall offer his offering
unto the Lord, one he lamb of the
first year without blemish for a
burnt offering, and one ewe lamb
of the first year without blemish for

vowed, so he must do after the law
of his separation.

unto them,

The Levites are washed, consecrated, and
set apart by the laying on of hands—They
are the Lord’s in place of the firstborn of
every family—They are a gift to Aaron and
his sons to do the service of the tabernacle.
And the Lord spake unto Moses,
saying,
2 Speak unto Aaron, and say unto
him, When thou lightest the a lamps,
the seven lamps shall give light over
against the candlestick.
3 And Aaron did so; he lighted the
lamps thereof over against the candlestick, as the Lord commanded Moses.
4 And this work of the candlestick
was of beaten gold, unto the shaft
thereof, unto the flowers thereof,
was beaten work: according unto the
a 
pattern which the Lord had shewed
Moses, so he made the candlestick.
5 ¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

children of Israel, and a cleanse them.

may execute the service of the

hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one
for a sin offering, and the other for
a burnt offering, unto the Lord, to
make an atonement for the Levites.
13 And thou shalt set the Levites
before Aaron, and before his sons,
and offer them for an offering unto

14 Thus shalt thou a separate the

go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: and
thou shalt cleanse them, and offer

of all the children of Israel, have I

I b sanctified them for myself.
18 And I have taken the a Levites

19 And I have given the Levites as

the service of the children of Israel
in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for
the children of Israel: that there be
no plague among the children of
Israel, when the children of Israel
come nigh unto the sanctuary.
20 And Moses, and Aaron, and all
the congregation of the children of
Israel, did to the Levites according
unto all that the Lord commanded
Moses concerning the Levites, so did
the children of Israel unto them.
21 And the Levites were a purified,
and they washed their clothes; and
Aaron offered them as an offering
before the Lord; and Aaron made
an atonement for them to cleanse
them.
22 And after that went the Levites
in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before
Aaron, and before his sons: as the
Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto
them.

Moses, saying,

Levites: from twenty and five years
old and upward they shall go in to
wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation:
25 And from the age of fifty years
they shall cease waiting upon the
service thereof, and shall serve no
more:

Israel is again commanded to keep the
Passover—A cloud rests upon the tabernacle by day and by night, plus a fire
by night—When the cloud rests, Israel
camps; when it lifts, they journey.
And the Lord spake unto Moses in
the wilderness of Sinai, in the first
month of the a second year after
they were come out of the land of
Egypt, saying,
2 Let the children of Israel also
keep the passover at his appointed
season.
3 In the a fourteenth day of this
month, at even, ye shall keep it in
his appointed season: according
to all the rites of it, and according to
all the ceremonies thereof, shall
ye keep it.
4 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep
the passover.
5 And they kept the passover on the
fourteenth day of the first month
at even in the wilderness of Sinai:
according to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so did the children
of Israel.
6 ¶ And there were certain men,
who were a defiled by the dead body
of a man, that they could not keep the
passover on that day: and they came
before Moses and before Aaron on
that day:
7 And those men said unto him,
We are defiled by a the dead body of
a man: wherefore are we kept back,
that we may not offer an offering
of the Lord in his appointed season among the children of Israel?
8 And Moses said unto them, Stand
still, and I will a hear what the Lord
will command concerning you.

and bitter herbs.
12 They shall leave none of it unto
the morning, nor a break any bone
of it: according to all the ordinances
of the passover they shall keep it.
13 But the man that is clean, and
is not in a journey, and forbeareth
to keep the passover, even the same
soul shall be cut off from among his
people: because he brought not the
offering of the Lord in his appointed
season, that man shall bear his sin.
14 And if a stranger shall sojourn
among you, and will keep the a passover unto the Lord; according to
the ordinance of the passover, and
according to the manner thereof, so
shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the b stranger, and
for him that was born in the land.
15 ¶ And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the a cloud
covered the tabernacle, namely, the
tent of the testimony: and at even
there was upon the tabernacle as it
were the appearance of fire, until
the morning.
16 So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance
of fire by night.
17 And when the cloud was taken
up from the tabernacle, then after
that the children of Israel journeyed:
and in the place where the cloud
abode, there the children of Israel
pitched their tents.
18 At the commandment of the
Lord the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment
of the Lord they pitched: as long

as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.
19 And when the cloud tarried
long upon the tabernacle many
days, then the children of Israel
kept the charge of the Lord, and
a 
journeyed not.
20 And so it was, when the cloud
was a few days upon the tabernacle;
according to the commandment of
the Lord they abode in their tents,
and according to the commandment
of the Lord they journeyed.
21 And so it was, when the cloud
abode from even unto the morning,
and that the cloud was taken up in
the morning, then they journeyed:
whether it was by day or by night
that the cloud was taken up, they
journeyed.
22 Or whether it were two days, or
a month, or a a year, that the cloud
tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel
abode in their tents, and journeyed
not: but when it was taken up, they
journeyed.
23 At the commandment of the
Lord they rested in the tents, and
at the commandment of the Lord
they journeyed: they kept the charge
of the Lord, at the commandment
of the Lord by the hand of Moses.
Chapter 10
Silver trumpets are used to call assemblies and to blow alarms—The cloud is
taken from the tabernacle, and the children of Israel march forth in their prescribed order—The ark of the covenant
goes before them in their journeyings.
And the Lord spake unto Moses,
saying,
2 Make thee two trumpets of silver;
of a a whole piece shalt thou make
them: that thou mayest use them for
the calling of the assembly, and
for the journeying of the camps.

4 And if they blow but with one
trumpet, then the princes, which are
heads of the thousands of Israel,
shall gather themselves unto thee.
5 When ye blow an alarm, then
the camps that lie on the east parts
shall go forward.
6 When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie
on the south side shall take their

7 But when the congregation is
to be gathered together, ye shall

in the second year, that the a cloud
was taken up from off the b tabernacle of the testimony.

14 ¶ In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of

son of Amminadab.

was Elizur the son of Shedeur.

over his host was Elishama the son
of Ammihud.
23 And over the host of the tribe

the children of Asher was Pagiel

27 And over the host of the tribe of

28 Thus were the journeyings of
the children of Israel according
to their armies, when they set
forward.
29 ¶ And Moses said unto Hobab,
the son of a Raguel the Midianite,
Moses’ father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the
Lord said, I will give it you: come
thou with us, and we will do thee
good: for the Lord hath spoken
good concerning Israel.
30 And he said unto him, I will not
go; but I will depart to mine own
land, and to my kindred.
31 And he said, Leave us not, I pray
thee; forasmuch as thou knowest
how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us
a 
instead of eyes.
32 And it shall be, if thou go with
us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the Lord shall do unto us, the
same will we do unto thee.
33 ¶ And they departed from the
mount of the Lord three days’ journey: and the a ark of the covenant
of the Lord went before them in
the three days’ journey, to search
out a resting place for them.
34 And the a cloud of the Lord was
upon them by day, when they went
out of the camp.
35 And it came to pass, when the
ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise
up, Lord, and let thine enemies be
a 
scattered; and let them that b hate
thee flee before thee.
36 And when it rested, he said,

Chapter 11
Fire from the Lord consumes the rebels
in Israel—Israel murmurs and lusts for
meat instead of manna—Moses complains that he cannot bear the burden
alone—He is commanded to choose
seventy elders to assist him —The
Lord promises meat until it becomes
loathsome to the Israelites—The seventy elders are chosen, they prophesy,
the Lord comes down, and Eldad and
Medad prophesy in the camp—Israel is
provided with quail—The people lust,
a great plague follows, and many die.
And when the people a complained,
it displeased the Lord: and the
Lord heard it; and his anger was
kindled; and the b fire of the Lord
burnt among them, and consumed
them that were in the uttermost parts
of the camp.
2 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto
the Lord, the fire was quenched.
3 And he called the name of the
place Taberah: because the fire of
the Lord burnt among them.
4 ¶ And the mixed multitude that
was among them fell a a lusting: and
the children of Israel also wept
again, and said, Who shall give us
flesh to eat?
5 We remember the fish, which we
did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks,
and the onions, and the garlick:
6 But now our soul is dried away:
there is nothing at all, beside this
manna, before our eyes.
7 And the a manna was as b coriander seed, and the colour thereof as
the colour of bdellium.
8 And the people went about, and
gathered it, and ground it in mills,
or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in
pans, and made cakes of it: and the
taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.

9 And when the dew fell upon
the camp in the night, the manna
fell a upon it.
10 ¶ Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his
tent: and the anger of the Lord
was kindled greatly; Moses also was
displeased.
11 And Moses said unto the Lord,
Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy
servant? and wherefore have I not
found favour in thy sight, that thou
layest the burden of all this people
upon me?
12 Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that
thou shouldest say unto me, Carry
them in thy bosom, as a nursing
father beareth the sucking child,
unto the land which thou swarest
unto their fathers?
13 Whence should I have flesh to
give unto all this people? for they
weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh,
that we may eat.
14 I am not able to bear all this
people alone, because it is too a heavy
for me.
15 And if thou deal thus with me,
kill me, I pray thee, a out of hand,
if I have found favour in thy sight;
and let me not see my wretchedness.
16 ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Gather unto me a seventy men
of the elders of Israel, whom thou
knowest to be the elders of the people, and b officers over them; and
bring them unto the c tabernacle
of the congregation, that they may
stand there with thee.
17 And I will come down and talk
with thee there: and I will take of
the spirit which is upon thee, and
will put it upon them; and they
shall a bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not
thyself alone.

18 And say thou unto the people,
Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye
have wept in the ears of the Lord,
saying, Who shall give us flesh to
eat? for it was well with us in Egypt:
therefore the Lord will give you
flesh, and ye shall eat.
19 Ye shall not eat one day, nor
two days, nor five days, neither ten
days, nor twenty days;
20 But even a whole month, until
it come out at your nostrils, and it
be loathsome unto you: because that
ye have despised the Lord which is
among you, and have wept before
him, saying, Why came we forth
out of Egypt?
21 And Moses said, The people,
among whom I am, are six hundred
thousand footmen; and thou hast
said, I will give them flesh, that
they may eat a whole month.
22 Shall the flocks and the herds
be slain for them, to suffice them?

Is the Lord’s hand waxed short?
thou shalt see now whether my word
shall come to pass unto thee or not.

the people the words of the Lord,

them round about the tabernacle.
25 And the Lord came down in
a a cloud, and spake unto him, and

rested upon them; and they were of

not out unto the tabernacle: and
they prophesied in the camp.
27 And there ran a young man,
and told Moses, and said, Eldad and
Medad do prophesy in the camp.
28 And a Joshua the son of b Nun, the
servant of Moses, one of his young
men, answered and said, My lord
Moses, forbid them.
29 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God
that all the Lord’s people were
a 
prophets, and that the Lord would
put his spirit upon them!
30 And Moses gat him into the
camp, he and the elders of Israel.
31 ¶ And there went forth a wind
from the Lord, and brought a quails
from the sea, and let them fall by
the camp, as it were a day’s journey
on this side, and as it were a day’s
journey on the other side, round
about the camp, and as it were two
cubits high upon the face of the
earth.
32 And the people stood up all
that day, and all that night, and all
the next day, and they gathered the
quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread
them all abroad for themselves round
about the camp.
33 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed,
the wrath of the Lord was kindled
against the people, and the Lord
smote the people with a very great
a 
plague.

there they buried the people that

Aaron and Miriam complain against
Moses, the most meek of all men—The
Lord promises to speak to Moses mouth
to mouth and to reveal to him the similitude of the Lord—Miriam becomes
leprous for a week.
And Miriam and Aaron spake
against Moses because of the a Ethio­
pian woman whom he had married:
for he had married an Ethiopian
woman.
2 And they said, Hath the Lord
indeed spoken only by Moses? hath
he not spoken also by us? And the
Lord heard it.
3 (Now the man Moses was very
a 
meek, above all the men which
were upon the face of the earth.)
4 And the Lord spake suddenly
unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and
unto Miriam, Come out ye three
unto the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.
5 And the Lord came down in the
a 
pillar of the cloud, and stood in the
door of the tabernacle, and called
Aaron and Miriam: and they both
came forth.
6 And he said, Hear now my words:
If there be a a prophet among you, I
the Lord will make myself known
unto him in a b vision, and will speak
unto him in a c dream.
7 My servant Moses is not so, who

to mouth, even apparently, and not

wherefore then were ye not afraid
to speak against my servant Moses?

was kindled against them; and he
departed.

Miriam became a leprous, white as

11 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas,
my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin
upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned.
12 Let her not be as one dead, of
whom the flesh is half consumed
when he cometh out of his mother’s womb.
13 And Moses cried unto the Lord,
saying, a Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee.
14 ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses,
If her father had but spit in her face,
should she not be ashamed seven
days? let her be shut out from the
camp seven days, and after that let
her be received in again.
15 And Miriam was shut out from
the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was
brought in again.
16 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched
in the wilderness of Paran.

search the land of Canaan, which
I give unto the children of Israel:
of every tribe of their fathers shall
ye send a man, every one a ruler

were heads of the children of Israel.

out the land of Canaan, and said unto
them, Get you up a this way southward, and go up into the mountain:

the people that dwelleth therein,

(Now Hebron was built seven years

23 And they came unto the a brook
of Eshcol, and cut down from thence
a branch with one cluster of grapes,
and they bare it between two upon
a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
24 The place was called the brook
Eshcol, because of the cluster of
grapes which the children of Israel
cut down from thence.
25 And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.
26 ¶ And they went and came to
Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the
congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran,
to Kadesh; and brought back word
unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit
of the land.

it are men of a great stature.
33 And there we saw the a giants,
the sons of Anak, which come of the
b 
giants: and we were in our own
sight as grasshoppers, and so we
were in their sight.
Chapter 14
Israel murmurs and speaks of returning to Egypt—Joshua and Caleb give
a good report of Canaan—Moses mediates between Israel and the Lord—
The adults of Israel will not enter the
promised land—The Lord slays the false
spies by a plague—Some rebels try to go
alone and are slain by the Amalekites
and Canaanites.
And all the congregation lifted up
their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.
2 And all the children of Israel
a 
murmured against Moses and
against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would
God that we had died in the land of
Egypt! or would God we had died
in this wilderness!
3 And wherefore hath the Lord
brought us unto this land, to fall
by the sword, that our wives and
our children should be a prey ? were
it not better for us to return into
Egypt?
4 And they said one to another,
Let us make a captain, and let us
a 
return into Egypt.
5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on
their faces before all the assembly
of the congregation of the children
of Israel.

and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
which were of them that searched
the land, rent their clothes:
7 And they spake unto all the
company of the children of Israel,
saying, The land, which we passed
through to search it, is an exceeding good land.
8 If the Lord delight in us, then
he will bring us into this land, and
give it us; a land which floweth with
milk and honey.
9 Only a rebel not ye against the
Lord, neither fear ye the people
of the land; for they are bread for
us: their defence is departed from
them, and the Lord is with us: b fear
them not.
10 But all the congregation bade
stone them with stones. And the
a 
glory of the Lord appeared in the
tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.
11 ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses,
How long will this people a provoke
me? and how long will it be ere
they b believe me, for all the signs
which I have shewed among them?
12 I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and
will make of thee a greater a nation
and mightier than they.
13 ¶ And Moses said unto the Lord,
Then the a Egyptians shall hear it,
(for thou broughtest up this people
in thy might from among them;)
14 And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have
heard that thou Lord art a among

people as one man, then the nations
which have heard the fame of thee
will speak, saying,
16 Because the Lord was not able
to bring this people into the land
which he sware unto them, therefore
he hath slain them in the wilderness.
17 And now, I beseech thee, let

of great mercy, b forgiving iniquity

unto the third and fourth generation.

the greatness of thy mercy, and as
thou hast forgiven this people, from

of the Lord.
22 Because all those men which
have seen my glory, and my a mira­

the wilderness by the way of the
Red sea.
26 ¶ And the Lord spake unto
Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
27 How long shall I bear with this
evil congregation, which a murmur
against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel,
which they murmur against me.
28 Say unto them, As truly as I live,
saith the Lord, as ye have spoken
in mine ears, so will I do to you:
29 Your a carcases shall fall in this
b 
wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your
whole number, from twenty years
old and upward, which have murmured against me,
30 Doubtless ye shall not come
into the land, concerning which I
sware to make you dwell therein,
save Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
and Joshua the son of Nun.
31 But your little ones, which ye
said should be a prey, them will I
bring in, and they shall know the
land which ye have despised.
32 But as for you, your carcases,
they shall fall in this wilderness.
33 And your children shall wander
in the wilderness a forty years, and
b 
bear your whoredoms, until your
carcases be wasted in the wilderness.
34 After the number of the days
in which ye searched the land, even
forty days, each day for a year, shall
ye bear your iniquities, even forty
years, and ye shall a know my breach
of promise.
35 I the Lord have said, I will
surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together
against me: in this wilderness they
shall be consumed, and there they
shall a die.
36 And the men, which Moses sent
to search the land, who returned,
and made all the congregation to
murmur against him, by bringing
up a slander upon the land,

37 Even those men that did bring
up the evil report upon the land,
a 
died by the b plague before the
Lord.
38 But Joshua the son of Nun, and
Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which
were of the men that went to search
the land, lived still.
39 And Moses told these sayings
unto all the children of Israel: and
the people a mourned greatly.
40 ¶ And they rose up early in the
morning, and gat them up into the
top of the mountain, saying, Lo,
we be here, and will go up unto the
place which the Lord hath promised: for we have a sinned.
41 And Moses said, Wherefore
now do ye transgress the commandment of the Lord? but it shall not
prosper.
42 Go not up, for the Lord is not
among you; that ye be not smitten
before your enemies.
43 For the a Amalekites and the
Canaanites are there before you,
and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the
Lord, therefore the Lord will not
be with you.
44 But they a presumed to go up
unto the hill top: nevertheless the
ark of the covenant of the Lord, and
Moses, departed not out of the camp.
45 Then the Amalekites came
down, and the Canaanites which
dwelt in that hill, and smote them,
and discomfited them, even unto
Hormah.

And the Lord spake unto Moses,
saying,
2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
be come into the land of your habi­
tations, which I give unto you,
3 And will make an a offering by
fire unto the Lord, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in performing a
vow, or in a freewill offering, or in
your solemn feasts, to make a sweet
savour unto the Lord, of the herd,
or of the flock:
4 Then shall he that offereth his
offering unto the Lord bring a
meat offering of a tenth deal of
flour mingled with the fourth part
of an hin of oil.
5 And the fourth part of an hin of
wine for a drink a offering shalt thou
prepare with the burnt offering or
sacrifice, for one lamb.
6 Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare
for a meat offering two tenth deals
of flour mingled with the third part
of an hin of oil.
7 And for a drink offering thou
shalt offer the third part of an hin
of wine, for a sweet savour unto
the Lord.
8 And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a
sacrifice in performing a vow, or
peace offerings unto the Lord:
9 Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth
deals of flour mingled with half an
hin of oil.
10 And thou shalt bring for a drink
offering half an hin of wine, for an
offering made by fire, of a sweet
savour unto the Lord.
11 Thus shall it be done for one
bullock, or for one ram, or for a
lamb, or a kid.
12 According to the number that
ye shall prepare, so shall ye do
to every one according to their
number.
13 All that are born of the country shall do these things after this
manner, in offering an offering

14 And if a stranger sojourn with
you, or whosoever be among you in
your generations, and will offer an
offering made by fire, of a sweet
savour unto the Lord; as ye do, so
he shall do.

you of the congregation, and also
for the stranger that sojourneth

16 a One law and one manner shall
be for you, and for the stranger that
sojourneth with you.
17 ¶ And the Lord spake unto
Moses, saying,
18 Speak unto the children of
Israel, and say unto them, When
ye come into the land whither I
bring you,
19 Then it shall be, that, when
ye eat of the bread of the land, ye
shall offer up an heave offering
unto the Lord.
20 Ye shall offer up a cake of the

offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall
ye b heave it.

shall give unto the Lord an heave

Moses,

commanded you by the hand of
Moses, from the day that the Lord
commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations;

25 And the priest shall make an

of the children of Israel, and it shall
be b forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto
the Lord, and their sin offering before the Lord, for their ignorance:
26 And it shall be forgiven all the
congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourn­
eth among them; seeing all the
people were in ignorance.
27 ¶ And if any soul sin through
a 
ignorance, then he shall bring a
she goat of the first year for a sin
offering.
28 And the priest shall make an
atonement for the soul that sinneth
ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the Lord, to make

be forgiven him.
29 Ye shall have one law for him

a 
Dathan and Abiram, the sons of
Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth,
sons of Reuben, took men:
2 And they a rose up before Moses,
with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes
of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:
3 And they gathered themselves
together against a Moses and against
Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take
too much upon you, seeing all the
congregation are holy, every one of
them, and the Lord is b among them:
wherefore then lift ye up yourselves
above the congregation of the Lord?
4 And when Moses heard it, he fell
upon his face:
5 And he spake unto Korah and
unto all his company, saying, Even
to morrow the Lord will shew who
are his, and who is a holy; and will
cause him to come near unto him:
even him whom he hath b chosen will
he cause to c come near unto him.

he shall be holy: ye take too much
upon you, ye sons of Levi.
8 And Moses said unto Korah, Hear,
I pray you, ye sons of Levi:
9 Seemeth it but a small thing unto
you, that the God of Israel hath sepa­
rated you from the congregation of
Israel, to bring you near to himself
to do the a service of the tabernacle
of the Lord, and to stand before the

of Levi with thee: and seek ye the

which said, We will not come up:
13 Is it a small thing that thou
hast brought us up out of a land
that floweth with milk and honey,
to kill us in the wilderness, except
thou make thyself altogether a
a 
prince over us?
14 Moreover thou hast not brought
us into a land that floweth with milk
and honey, or given us inheritance
of fields and vineyards: wilt thou
put out the eyes of these men? we
will not come up.
15 And Moses was very wroth,
and said unto the Lord, a Respect
not thou their offering: I have not
taken one ass from them, neither
have I hurt one of them.
16 And Moses said unto Korah,
Be thou and all thy company before the Lord, thou, and they, and
Aaron, to morrow:
17 And take every man his censer,
and put incense in them, and bring
ye before the Lord every man his
censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each of
you his censer.
18 And they took every man his
censer, and put fire in them, and
laid incense thereon, and stood in
the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation with Moses and Aaron.
19 And Korah gathered all the
congregation against them unto the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the Lord
appeared unto all the congregation.

among this congregation, that I
may consume them in a moment.
22 And they fell upon their faces,
and said, O God, the a God of the
b 
spirits of all flesh, shall one man
sin, and wilt thou be wroth with
all the congregation?
23 ¶ And the Lord spake unto
Moses, saying,
24 Speak unto the congregation,
saying, Get you up from about the
a 
tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and
Abiram.
25 And Moses rose up and went
unto Dathan and Abiram; and the
elders of Israel followed him.
26 And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you,
from the tents of these wicked men,
and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye
be consumed in all their sins.
27 So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on
every side: and Dathan and Abiram
came out, and stood in the door of
their a tents, and their wives, and
their sons, and their little children.
28 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall
know that the Lord hath sent me
to do all these works; for I have not
done them of mine own a mind.
29 If these men die the common
death of all men, or if they be visited a after the visitation of all men;
then the Lord hath not sent me.
30 But if the Lord make a new
thing, and the earth open her mouth,
and swallow them up, with all that
appertain unto them, and they go
down quick into the a pit; then ye
shall understand that these men
have provoked the Lord.

and their c houses, and all the men
that appertained unto Korah, and

33 They, and all that appertained to
them, went down alive into the a pit,
and the earth closed upon them:
and they perished from among the
congregation.
34 And all Israel that were round
about them fled at the cry of them:
for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.
35 And there came out a a  fire
from the Lord, and consumed the
two hundred and fifty men that
offered incense.
36 ¶ And the Lord spake unto
Moses, saying,
37 Speak unto Eleazar the son of
Aaron the priest, that he take up
the censers out of the burning, and
scatter thou the fire yonder; for they
are hallowed.
38 The censers of these a sinners
against their own souls, let them
make them broad plates for a cov­
ering of the altar: for they offered
them before the Lord, therefore
they are hallowed: and they shall
be a sign unto the children of Israel.
39 And Eleazar the priest took
the brasen censers, wherewith they
that were burnt had offered; and
they were made broad plates for a
covering of the altar:
40 To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no a stranger,
which is not of the seed of b Aaron,

against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed
the people of the Lord.
42 And it came to pass, when the
congregation was gathered against
Moses and against Aaron, that they
looked toward the tabernacle of
the congregation: and, behold, the
cloud covered it, and the glory of
the Lord appeared.
43 And Moses and Aaron came
before the tabernacle of the congregation.
44 ¶ And the Lord spake unto
Moses, saying,
45 a Get you up from among this
congregation, that I may consume
them as in a moment. And they fell
upon their faces.
46 ¶ And Moses said unto Aaron,
Take a censer, and put fire therein
from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement
for them: for there is wrath gone
out from the Lord; the a plague is
begun.
47 And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst
of the congregation; and, behold,
the plague was begun among the
people: and he put on incense, and
made an atonement for the people.
48 And he stood between the a dead
and the living; and the b plague was
stayed.
49 Now they that died in the plague
were fourteen thousand and seven
hundred, beside them that died
about the matter of Korah.
50 And Aaron returned unto Moses
unto the door of the tabernacle of
the congregation: and the plague
was stayed.

rod according to the house of their
fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers
twelve rods: write thou every man’s
name upon his rod.
3 And thou shalt write Aaron’s
name upon the rod of Levi: for one
rod shall be for the head of the house
of their fathers.
4 And thou shalt lay them up in
the a tabernacle of the congregation
before the testimony, where I will

5 And it shall come to pass, that

shall blossom: and I will make to
cease from me the murmurings of
the children of Israel, whereby they
murmur against you.

a 
princes gave him a rod apiece, for
each prince one, according to their
fathers’ houses, even twelve rods:
and the rod of Aaron was among
their rods.
7 And Moses laid up the rods before the Lord in the a tabernacle
of witness.
8 And it came to pass, that on the
morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the
rod of Aaron for the house of Levi
was budded, and brought forth
buds, and bloomed blossoms, and
yielded almonds.
9 And Moses brought out all the
rods from before the Lord unto
all the children of Israel: and they
looked, and took every man his rod.
10 ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Bring a Aaron’s rod again before
the testimony, to be kept for a token
against the rebels; and thou shalt
quite take away their murmurings
from me, that they die not.

Directions are given for the sacrifice of
a red heifer—The water of separation
is used for purification from sin—Ceremonially unclean persons are sprinkled
with the water of separation.
And the Lord spake unto Moses
and unto Aaron, saying,
2 This is the ordinance of the law
which the Lord hath commanded,
saying, Speak unto the children of
Israel, that they bring thee a red
heifer without a spot, wherein is
no blemish, and upon which never
came yoke:
3 And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring
her forth without the camp, and
one shall slay her before his face:
4 And Eleazar the priest shall take
of her a blood with his finger, and
sprinkle of her blood directly before the b tabernacle of the congregation seven times:
5 And one shall burn the heifer in
his sight; her skin, and her flesh,

place.

and her blood, with her dung, shall
he burn:
6 And the priest shall take cedar
wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and
cast it into the midst of the burning
of the heifer.
7 Then the priest shall a wash his
clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh
in water, and afterward he shall
come into the camp, and the priest
shall be unclean until the even.
8 And he that burneth her shall
wash his clothes in water, and bathe
his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.
9 And a man that is clean shall
gather up the ashes of the heifer,
and lay them up without the camp
in a clean place, and it shall be kept
for the congregation of the children
of Israel for a a water of separation:
it is a purification for sin.
10 And he that gathereth the ashes
of the heifer shall wash his clothes,
and be unclean until the even: and
it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute
for ever.
11 ¶ He that toucheth the dead
body of any man shall be a unclean
seven days.
12 He shall purify himself with it
on the third day, and on the seventh
day he shall be clean: but if he purify
not himself the third day, then the
seventh day he shall not be clean.
13 Whosoever toucheth the dead
body of any man that is dead, and
purifieth not himself, defileth the
tabernacle of the Lord; and that
soul shall be a cut off from Israel:
because the water of separation was
not sprinkled upon him, he shall
be unclean; his uncleanness is yet
upon him.
14 This is the law, when a man
dieth in a tent: all that come into

therefore ye shall not c bring this

from Kadesh unto the king of Edom,
Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou
knowest all the travail that hath
befallen us:
15 How our fathers went down
into Egypt, and we have dwelt in
Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:
16 And when we cried unto the
Lord, he heard our voice, and sent
an a angel, and hath brought us forth
out of Egypt: and, behold, we are
in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost
of thy border:
17 Let us pass, I pray thee, through
thy country: we will not pass
through the fields, or through the
vineyards, neither will we drink of
the water of the wells: we will go
by the king’s high way, we will not
turn to the right hand nor to the left,
until we have passed thy borders.
18 And Edom said unto him, Thou
shalt not pass a by me, lest I come

wherefore Israel turned away from

22 ¶ And the children of Israel,

23 And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the
a 
coast of the land of Edom, saying,

his people: for he shall not enter
into the land which I have given
unto the children of Israel, because

The children of Israel destroy those Canaanites who fight against them—The
Israelites are plagued with fiery serpents—Moses lifts up a serpent of brass
to save those who look thereon—Israel
defeats the Amorites, destroys the people
of Bashan, and occupies their lands.
And when a king b Arad the Canaanite,
which dwelt in the c south, heard tell
that Israel came by the way of d the
spies; then he fought against Israel,
and took some of them prisoners.
2 And Israel vowed a a vow unto
the Lord, and said, If thou wilt
indeed deliver this people into my
hand, then I will utterly destroy
their cities.
3 And the Lord hearkened to the
voice of Israel, and delivered up
the Canaanites; and they utterly
a 
destroyed them and their cities:
and he called the name of the place
b 
Hormah.
4 ¶ And they journeyed from
mount a Hor by the way of the b Red
sea, to c compass the land of Edom:
and the soul of the people was much
discouraged because of the way.
5 And the people a spake against
God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of
Egypt to die in the wilderness? for
there is no bread, neither is there any
water; and our soul loatheth this
light bread.

for we have spoken against the

the Lord, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses b prayed
for the people.
8 And the Lord said unto Moses,
a 
Make thee a fiery serpent, and set
it upon a pole: and it shall come to
pass, that every one that is bitten,
when he looketh upon it, shall b live.
9 And Moses made a a serpent of

came to pass, that if a serpent had
bitten any man, when he beheld
the serpent of brass, he lived.

13 From thence they removed,

17 ¶ Then Israel sang this song,
Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:
18 The princes digged the well,
the nobles of the people digged it,
by the direction of the lawgiver, with
their staves. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:
19 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel:
and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:
20 And from Bamoth in the valley,
that is in the country of Moab, to
the top of Pisgah, which a looketh
toward Jeshimon.
21 ¶ And Israel sent messengers
unto a Sihon king of the b Amorites,
saying,
22 Let me pass through thy land:
we will not turn into the fields,
or into the vineyards; we will not
drink of the waters of the well: but
we will go along by the king’s high
way, until we be past thy borders.
23 And a Sihon would not suffer
Israel to pass through his b border:
but Sihon gathered all his people
together, and went out against Israel
into the wilderness: and he came
to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
24 And Israel a smote him with the
edge of the sword, and possessed
his land from b Arnon unto Jabbok,
even unto the children of Ammon:
for the border of the children of
Ammon was strong.
25 And Israel took all these a cities:
and Israel dwelt in all the cities of
the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in
all the villages thereof.
26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who
had fought against the former king
of Moab, and taken all his land out
of his hand, even unto Arnon.
27 Wherefore they that speak in
proverbs say, Come into Heshbon,
let the city of Sihon be built and
a 
prepared:

Heshbon, a flame from the city
of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of
Moab, and the lords of the high
places of Arnon.
29 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art
undone, O people of a Chemosh: he
hath given his sons that escaped,
and his daughters, into captivity
unto Sihon king of the Amorites.
30 We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon,
and we have laid them waste even
unto Nophah, which reacheth unto
Medeba.
31 ¶ Thus Israel dwelt in the land
of the Amorites.
32 And Moses sent to spy out
a 
Jaazer, and they took the villages
thereof, and drove out the Amorites
that were there.
33 ¶ And they turned and went
up by the way of Bashan: and a Og
the king of Bashan went out against
them, he, and all his people, to the
battle at Edrei.
34 And the Lord said unto Moses,
Fear him not: for I have delivered
him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt
do to him as thou didst unto Sihon
king of the a Amorites, which dwelt
at Heshbon.
35 So they a smote him, and his
sons, and all his people, until there
was none left him alive: and they
possessed his land.

2 ¶ And a Balak the son of Zippor
saw all that Israel had done to the
Amorites.
3 And Moab was sore afraid of the
people, because they were many:
and Moab was distressed because
of the children of Israel.
4 And Moab said unto the elders
of Midian, Now shall this company
lick up all that are round about us,
as the ox licketh up the grass of the
field. And Balak the son of Zippor
was king of the Moabites at that time.
5 He sent messengers therefore
unto a Balaam the son of Beor to
Pethor, which is by the river of the
land of the children of his people, to
call him, saying, Behold, there is a
people come out from Egypt: behold,
they cover the face of the earth, and
they abide over against me:
6 Come now therefore, I pray thee,
curse me this people; for they are
too mighty for me: peradventure
I shall prevail, that we may smite
them, and that I may drive them
out of the land: for I a wot that he
whom thou blessest is blessed, and
he whom thou cursest is cursed.
7 And the elders of Moab and the
elders of Midian departed with the
a 
rewards of b divination in their
hand; and they came unto Balaam,
and spake unto him the words of
Balak.
8 And he said unto them, Lodge
here this night, and I will bring
you word again, as the Lord shall
speak unto me: and the a princes of
Moab abode with Balaam.
9 And God came unto Balaam, and
said, What men are these with thee?
10 And Balaam said unto God,
Balak the son of Zippor, king of
Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,
11 Behold, there is a people come
out of Egypt, which covereth the
face of the earth: come now, curse
me them; peradventure I shall be
able to overcome them, and drive
them out.

12 And God said unto Balaam,
Thou shalt not go with them; thou
shalt not curse the people: for they
are blessed.
13 And Balaam rose up in the
morning, and said unto the princes
of Balak, Get you into your land: for
the Lord refuseth to give me leave
to go with you.
14 And the princes of Moab rose
up, and they went unto Balak,
and said, Balaam refuseth to come
with us.
15 ¶ And Balak sent yet again
princes, more, and more honourable than they.
16 And they came to Balaam, and
said to him, Thus saith Balak the son
of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee,
hinder thee from coming unto me:
17 For I will promote thee unto
very great honour, and I will do
whatsoever thou sayest unto me:
come therefore, I pray thee, curse
me this people.
18 And Balaam answered and said
unto the servants of Balak, If Balak
would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond
the word of the Lord my God, to
do less or more.
19 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry
ye also here this night, that I may
know what the Lord will say unto
me more.
20 And God came unto Balaam
at night, and said unto him, If the
men come to call thee, rise up, and
go with them; but yet the word
which I shall say unto thee, that
shalt thou do.
21 And Balaam rose up in the
morning, and saddled his ass, and
went with the princes of Moab.
22 ¶ And God’s anger was kindled
because he went: and the angel of
the Lord stood in the way for an
adversary against him. Now he was
riding upon his ass, and his two
servants were with him.
23 And the ass a saw the angel of

the Lord standing in the way, and
his sword drawn in his hand: and
the ass turned aside out of the
way, and went into the field: and
Balaam smote the ass, to turn her
into the way.
24 But the angel of the Lord stood
in a path of the vineyards, a wall
being on this side, and a wall on
that side.
25 And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she thrust herself
unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s
foot against the wall: and he smote
her again.
26 And the angel of the Lord went
further, and stood in a narrow place,
where was no way to turn either to
the right hand or to the left.
27 And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger
was kindled, and he smote the ass
with a staff.
28 And the Lord opened the mouth
of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee,
that thou hast smitten me these
three times?
29 And Balaam said unto the ass,
Because thou hast mocked me: I
would there were a sword in mine
hand, for now would I a kill thee.
30 And the a ass said unto Balaam,
Am not I thine ass, upon which thou
hast ridden ever since I was thine
unto this day ? was I ever b wont to
do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.
31 Then the Lord opened the eyes
of Balaam, and he saw the angel of
the Lord standing in the way, and
his sword drawn in his hand: and
he bowed down his head, and fell
flat on his face.
32 And the angel of the Lord said
unto him, Wherefore hast thou
smitten thine ass these three times?
behold, I went out to withstand
thee, because thy way is a perverse
before me:
33 And the ass saw me, and turned
from me these three times: unless
she had turned from me, surely

now also I had slain thee, and saved
her alive.
34 And Balaam said unto the angel of the Lord, I have sinned; for
I knew not that thou stoodest in
the way against me: now therefore,
if it displease thee, I will get me
back again.
35 And the angel of the Lord said
unto Balaam, Go with the men: but
only the word that I shall speak
unto thee, that thou shalt speak.
So Balaam went with the princes
of Balak.
36 ¶ And when Balak heard that
Balaam was come, he went out to
meet him unto a city of Moab, which
is in the border of Arnon, which is
in the utmost a coast.
37 And Balak said unto Balaam,
Did I not earnestly send unto thee
to call thee? wherefore camest thou
not unto me? am I not able indeed
to promote thee to honour?
38 And Balaam said unto Balak,
Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now
any power at all to say any thing?
the word that God putteth in my
mouth, that shall I speak.
39 And Balaam went with Balak,
and they came unto Kirjath-huzoth.
40 And Balak offered oxen and
sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to
the princes that were with him.
41 And it came to pass on the
morrow, that Balak took Balaam,
and brought him up into the high
places of Baal, that thence he might
see the utmost part of the people.
Chapter 23
The Lord commands Balaam to bless
Israel—He does so, saying, Who can
count the dust of Jacob? and, What
hath God wrought!
And Balaam said unto Balak, Build
me here seven altars, and prepare
me here a seven oxen and seven rams.

on every altar a bullock and a ram.

Stand by thy burnt offering, and I

he sheweth me I will tell thee. And
he went to a an high place.
4 And God met Balaam: and he said
unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon every
altar a bullock and a ram.
5 And the Lord put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, Return unto
Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.
6 And he returned unto him, and,
lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice,
he, and all the princes of Moab.
7 And he took up his parable,
and said, Balak the king of Moab
hath brought me from Aram, out
of the mountains of the east, saying,
Come, curse me Jacob, and come,
a 
defy Israel.
8 How shall I curse, whom God
hath not cursed? or how shall I defy,
whom the Lord hath not defied?
9 For from the top of the rocks I
see him, and from the hills I behold
him: lo, the people shall dwell alone,
and shall not be reckoned among
the nations.
10 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth
part of Israel? Let me die the a death
of the righteous, and let my last end
be like his!
11 And Balak said unto a Balaam,
What hast thou done unto me? I
took thee to b curse mine enemies,
and, behold, thou hast blessed them
altogether.
12 And he answered and said, Must
I not take heed to speak that which
the Lord hath put in my mouth?
13 And Balak said unto him, Come,
I pray thee, with me unto another
place, from whence thou mayest
see them: thou shalt see but the
utmost part of them, and shalt not
see them all: and curse me them
from thence.

put a word in his mouth, and said,
Go again unto Balak, and say thus.
17 And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering,
and the princes of Moab with him.
And Balak said unto him, What
hath the Lord spoken?
18 And he took up his parable, and
said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:
19 God is not a man, that he should
a 
lie; neither the son of man, that he
should b repent: hath he said, and
shall he not do it? or hath he c spoken, and shall he not make it good?
20 Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath
blessed; and I cannot reverse it.
21 He hath not beheld iniquity in
Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the Lord his God is
with him, and the shout of a king
is among them.

Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee

28 And Balak brought Balaam

29 And Balaam said unto Balak,

Balaam sees in vision and prophesies
of the destiny of Israel—He prophesies
of the Messiah: There will come a Star
out of Jacob, and a Sceptre will rise
out of Israel.
And when Balaam saw that it
a 
pleased the Lord to bless Israel,
he went not, as at other times, to
seek for enchantments, but he set
his face toward the wilderness.
2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes,
and he saw Israel abiding in his tents
according to their a tribes; and the
spirit of God came upon him.
3 And he took up his a parable, and
said, Balaam the son of Beor hath
said, and the man whose eyes are

4 He hath said, which heard the
words of God, which saw the a vision of the Almighty, falling into

unto Balaam, I called thee to curse
mine enemies, and, behold, thou
hast altogether blessed them these
three times.
11 Therefore now flee thou to thy
place: I thought to promote thee
unto great honour; but, lo, the Lord
hath kept thee back from honour.
12 And Balaam said unto Balak,
Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me,
saying,
13 If Balak would give me his house
full of silver and gold, I cannot go
beyond the commandment of the
Lord, to do either good or bad of

saith, that will I b speak?

people: come therefore, and I will a advertise thee what this people shall
do to thy people in the latter days.

and took up his parable, and said,

5 And Moses said unto the judges
of Israel, a Slay ye every one his
men that were joined unto b Baalpeor.
6 ¶ And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought
unto his brethren a Midianitish
woman in the sight of Moses, and
in the sight of all the congregation
of the children of Israel, who were
weeping before the door of the a tabernacle of the congregation.
7 And when a Phinehas, the son of
Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,
saw it, he rose up from among the
congregation, and took a javelin
in his hand;
8 And he went after the man of
Israel into the tent, and thrust both
of them through, the man of Israel,
and the woman through her belly.
So the plague was stayed from the
children of Israel.
9 And those that died in the plague
were twenty and four thousand.
10 ¶ And the Lord spake unto
Moses, saying,

the son of Aaron the priest, hath

14 Now the name of the Israelite
that was slain, even that was slain
with the Midianitish woman, was
Zimri, the son of Salu, a a prince of
a chief house among the Simeonites.
15 And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi,
the daughter of Zur; he was head
over a people, and of a chief house
in Midian.
16 ¶ And the Lord spake unto
Moses, saying,
17 Vex the Midianites, and a smite
them:
18 For they vex you with their
wiles, wherewith they have beguiled
you in the matter of Peor, and in
the matter of Cozbi, the daughter
of a prince of Midian, their sister,
which was slain in the day of the
plague a for Peor’s sake.

The law of inheritances to sons, daughters, and kinsmen is explained—Moses will see but not enter the promised

to lead Israel.
Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of

of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these
are the names of his daughters;
Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and

2 And they stood before Moses,
and before Eleazar the priest, and
before the a princes and all the congregation, by the door of the b tabernacle of the congregation, saying,
3 Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company
of them that gathered themselves
together against the Lord in the
company of Korah; but died in his
own sin, and had no sons.
4 Why should the name of our

Give unto us therefore a possession

thou shalt cause the inheritance of
their father to pass unto them.
8 And thou shalt speak unto the
children of Israel, saying, If a man
die, and have no son, then ye shall
cause his inheritance to pass unto
his daughter.
9 And if he have no daughter, then
ye shall give his inheritance unto
his brethren.

Vows and oaths must be kept—Fathers

which the Lord hath commanded.
2 If a man vow a a vow unto the
Lord, or swear an b oath to bind
his soul with a bond; he shall not

a bond, being in her father’s house

4 And her father hear her vow,
and her a bond wherewith she hath

hold his peace at her: then all her
vows shall stand, and every bond
wherewith she hath bound her soul
shall stand.
5 But if her father disallow her

6 And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered
ought out of her lips, wherewith
she bound her soul;
7 And her husband heard it, and
held his peace at her in the day
that he heard it: then her vows shall
stand, and her bonds wherewith she
bound her soul shall stand.
8 But if her husband disallowed
her on the day that he heard it;
then he shall make her vow which
she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she

the Lord shall forgive her.
9 But every vow of a widow, and
of her that is divorced, wherewith
they have bound their souls, shall

10 And if she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound her soul by

held his peace at her, and disallowed
her not: then all her vows shall

Chapter 31
Moses sends forth 12,000 warriors who
destroy the Midianites—The prey is divided in Israel—None in the armies of
Israel are lost.
And the Lord spake unto Moses,
saying,
2 a Avenge the children of Israel
of the b Midianites: afterward shalt
thou be gathered unto thy people.
3 And Moses spake unto the people,
saying, Arm some of yourselves unto
the war, and let them go against the
Midianites, and avenge the Lord
of Midian.
4 Of ever y tribe a thousand,
throughout all the tribes of Israel,
shall ye send to the war.
5 So there were delivered out of the
thousands of Israel, a thousand of
every tribe, twelve thousand armed
for war.
6 And Moses sent them to the war,
a thousand of every tribe, them and
Phinehas the son of Eleazar the
priest, to the war, with the holy
instruments, and the trumpets to
blow in his hand.
7 And they warred against the
Midianites, as the Lord commanded
Moses; and they slew all the males.
8 And they slew the a kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were
slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and
Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings
of Midian: Balaam also the son of
Beor they slew with the sword.
9 And the children of Israel took
all the women of Midian captives,
and their little ones, and took the
spoil of all their cattle, and all their
flocks, and all their goods.
10 And they burnt all their cities
wherein they dwelt, and all their
a 
goodly castles, with fire.
11 And they took all the spoil,
and all the prey, both of men and
of beasts.
12 And they brought the captives,

Numbers 31:13–36

and the prey, and the spoil, unto
Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and
unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the
plains of Moab, which are by Jordan
near Jericho.
13 ¶ And Moses, and Eleazar the
priest, and all the a princes of the
congregation, went forth to meet
them without the camp.
14 And Moses was wroth with the
officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains
over hundreds, which came from
the battle.
15 And Moses said unto them, Have
ye saved all the women alive?
16 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit a trespass
against the Lord in the matter of
Peor, and there was a plague among
the congregation of the Lord.
17 Now therefore kill every male
among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man
by lying with him.
18 But all the a women children,
that have not known a man by lying
with him, keep alive for yourselves.
19 And do ye abide without the
camp seven days: whosoever hath
killed any person, and whosoever
hath touched any slain, purify both
yourselves and your captives on the
third day, and on the seventh day.
20 And purify all your raiment,
and all that is made of skins, and
all work of goats’ hair, and all things
made of wood.
21 ¶ And Eleazar the priest said
unto the men of war which went
to the battle, This is the ordinance
of the law which the Lord commanded Moses;
22 Only the gold, and the silver, the
brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
23 Every thing that may abide the
fire, ye shall make it go through the
fire, and it shall be clean: never­
theless it shall be purified with the

abideth not the fire ye shall make
go through the water.
24 And ye shall wash your clothes
on the seventh day, and ye shall be
clean, and afterward ye shall come
into the camp.
25 ¶ And the Lord spake unto
Moses, saying,
26 Take the sum of the prey that
was taken, both of man and of beast,
thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the
chief fathers of the congregation:
27 And divide the prey into two
parts; between them that a took the
war upon them, who went out to
battle, and between all the congregation:
28 And levy a tribute unto the
Lord of the men of war which
went out to battle: one soul of five
hundred, both of the persons, and
of the beeves, and of the asses, and
of the sheep:
29 Take it of their half, and give
it unto Eleazar the priest, for an
a 
heave offering of the Lord.
30 And of the children of Israel’s
half, thou shalt take one portion of
fifty, of the persons, of the beeves,
of the asses, and of the flocks, of
all manner of beasts, and give them
unto the Levites, which keep the
charge of the tabernacle of the Lord.
31 And Moses and Eleazar the
priest did as the Lord commanded
Moses.
32 And the booty, being the rest
of the prey which the men of war
had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five
thousand sheep,
33 And threescore and twelve
thousand beeves,
34 And threescore and one thousand asses,
35 And thirty and two thousand
persons in all, of women that had
not known man by lying with him.

was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand
and five hundred sheep:
37 And the Lord’s tribute of the
sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.
38 And the beeves were thirty and
six thousand; of which the Lord’s
tribute was threescore and twelve.
39 And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which
the Lord’s tribute was threescore
and one.
40 And the persons were sixteen
thousand; of which the Lord’s tribute was thirty and two persons.
41 And Moses gave the tribute,
which was the Lord’s heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the
Lord commanded Moses.
42 And of the children of Israel’s
half, which Moses divided from the
men that warred,
43 (Now the half that pertained unto
the congregation was three hundred
thousand and thirty thousand and
seven thousand and five hundred
sheep,
44 And thirty and six thousand
beeves,
45 And thirty thousand asses and
five hundred,
46 And sixteen thousand persons;)
47 Even of the children of Israel’s
half, Moses took one portion of fifty,
both of man and of beast, and gave
them unto the Levites, which kept
the charge of the tabernacle of the
Lord; as the Lord commanded
Moses.
48 ¶ And the officers which were
over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of
hundreds, came near unto Moses:
49 And they said unto Moses, Thy
servants have taken the sum of the
men of war which are under our
charge, and there lacketh not one
man of us.
50 We have therefore brought an
a 
oblation for the Lord, what every
man hath gotten, of b jewels of gold,
chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings,

and tablets, to make an c atonement
for our souls before the Lord.
51 And Moses and Eleazar the
priest took the gold of them, even
all wrought a jewels.
52 And all the gold of the offering
that they offered up to the Lord,
of the captains of thousands, and of
the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and
fifty shekels.
53 (For the men of war had taken
spoil, every man for himself.)
54 And Moses and Eleazar the
priest took the gold of the captains
of thousands and of hundreds, and
brought it into the tabernacle of
the congregation, for a memorial
for the children of Israel before
the Lord.
Chapter 32
Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh receive their inheritances east
of the Jordan—They covenant to join
other tribes in conquering Canaan.
Now the children of Reuben and
the children of Gad had a very great
multitude of cattle: and when they
saw the land of Jazer, and the land
of Gilead, that, behold, the place
was a place for cattle;
2 The children of a Gad and the
children of b  Reuben came and
spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar
the priest, and unto the princes of
the congregation, saying,
3 Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer,
and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and
Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo,
and Beon,
4 Even the country which the Lord
smote before the congregation of
Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy
servants have cattle:
5 Wherefore, said they, if we have
found grace in thy sight, let this
land be given unto thy servants
for a possession, and bring us not
over Jordan.

Numbers 32:7–30

Reuben, Shall your brethren go to
war, and shall ye sit here?
7 And wherefore discourage ye the
heart of the children of Israel from
going over into the land which the
Lord hath given them?
8 Thus did your fathers, when I
sent them from Kadesh-barnea to
see the land.
9 For when they went up unto the
valley of Eshcol, and saw the land,
they discouraged the heart of the
children of Israel, that they should
not go into the land which the Lord
had given them.
10 And the Lord’s anger was kindled the same time, and he sware,
saying,
11 Surely none of the men that
came up out of Egypt, from twenty
years old and upward, shall a see the
land which I sware unto Abraham,
unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because
they have not wholly followed me:
12 Save a Caleb the son of Jephun­
neh the Kenezite, and Joshua the
son of Nun: for they have wholly
followed the Lord.
13 And the Lord’s anger was kindled against Israel, and he made
them wander in the wilderness
forty years, until all the generation,
that had done evil in the sight of
the Lord, was consumed.
14 And, behold, ye are risen up in
your fathers’ stead, an increase of
sinful men, to augment yet the fierce
anger of the Lord toward Israel.
15 For if ye turn away from after
him, he will yet again leave them
in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.
16 ¶ And they came near unto him,
and said, We will build sheepfolds
here for our cattle, and cities for
our little ones:
17 But we ourselves will go ready
armed before the children of Israel,
until we have brought them unto
their place: and our little ones shall
dwell in the fenced cities because
of the inhabitants of the land.
18 We will not return unto our
	11	a	 Num. 14:23.
	12	a	 Josh. 15:17.

houses, until the children of Israel
have inherited every man his a inheritance.
19 For we will not inherit with
them on a yonder side Jordan, or
forward; because our inheritance
is fallen to us on this side Jordan
eastward.
20 ¶ And Moses said unto them,
If ye will a do this thing, if ye will
go armed before the Lord to war,
21 And will go all of you armed
over Jordan before the Lord, until he hath driven out his enemies
from before him,
22 And the land be subdued before
the Lord: then afterward ye shall
return, and be guiltless before the
Lord, and before Israel; and this
land shall be your possession before the Lord.
23 But if ye will not do so, behold,
ye have sinned against the Lord: and
be sure your sin will find you out.
24 Build you cities for your little
ones, and folds for your sheep; and
do that which hath proceeded out
of your mouth.
25 And the children of Gad and
the children of Reuben spake unto
Moses, saying, Thy servants will do
as my lord commandeth.
26 Our little ones, our wives, our
flocks, and all our cattle, shall be
there in the cities of Gilead:
27 But thy servants will pass over,
every man armed for war, before
the Lord to battle, as my lord
saith.
28 So concerning them Moses
commanded Eleazar the priest, and
Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief
fathers of the tribes of the children
of Israel:
29 And Moses said unto them, If
the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you
over Jordan, every man armed to
battle, before the Lord, and the
land shall be subdued before you;
then ye shall give them the land of
Gilead for a possession:
30 But if they will not pass over

with you armed, they shall have
possessions among you in the land
of Canaan.
31 And the children of Gad and
the children of Reuben answered,
saying, As the Lord hath said unto
thy servants, so will we do.
32 We will pass over armed before
the Lord into the land of Canaan,
that the possession of our a inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours.
33 And Moses a gave unto them, even
to the children of Gad, and to the
children of Reuben, and unto half
the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of
the Amorites, and the kingdom of
Og king of Bashan, the land, with
the cities thereof b in the coasts,
even the cities of the country round
about.
34 ¶ And the children of Gad a built
Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
35 And Atroth, Shophan, and
Jaazer, and Jogbehah,
36 And Beth-nimrah, and Bethharan, a fenced cities: and folds for
sheep.
37 And the children of Reuben
built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and
Kirjathaim,
38 And Nebo, and Baal-meon,
(their names being changed,) and
Shibmah: and gave other names
unto the cities which they builded.
39 And the children of a Machir
the son of b Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed
the Amorite which was in it.
40 And Moses gave a Gilead unto
Machir the son of Manasseh; and
he dwelt therein.
41 And Jair the son of Manasseh
went and took the small a towns
thereof, and called them Havoth-jair.

and called it Nobah, after his own

Israel’s journeys from Egypt to Canaan
are reviewed—The people are commanded to drive out the inhabitants of

will vex Israel.
These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went forth
out of the land of Egypt with their
armies under the hand of Moses
and Aaron.
2 And Moses wrote their goings
out according to their journeys by
the commandment of the Lord: and
these are their journeys according
to their goings out.

children of Israel went out b with
an c high hand in the sight of all
the Egyptians.

firstborn, which the Lord had smitten among them: upon their gods
also the Lord executed judgments.
5 And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched
in a Succoth.
6 And they departed from Succoth,
and pitched in Etham, which is in
the edge of the wilderness.
7 And they removed from Etham,
and a turned again unto Pi-hahiroth,
which is before Baal-zephon: and
they pitched before Migdol.
8 And they departed from before
Pi-hahiroth, and passed through the

and went three days’ journey in the
wilderness of Etham, and pitched
in Marah.
9 And they removed from Marah,

were twelve a fountains of water, and
threescore and ten palm trees; and

images, and quite pluck down all

53 And ye shall dispossess the
inhabitants of the land, and dwell
therein: for I have given you the
land to possess it.
54 And ye shall divide the a land
by b lot for an c inheritance among
your families: and to the more ye
shall give the more inheritance, and
to the fewer ye shall give the less
inheritance: every man’s inheritance
shall be in the place where his lot
falleth; according to the tribes of
your fathers ye shall inherit.
55 But if ye will not drive out the
inhabitants of the land from before
you; then it shall come to pass, that
those which ye let remain of them
shall be a pricks in your eyes, and
thorns in your sides, and shall vex
you in the land wherein ye dwell.

that I shall do unto you, as I thought
to do unto them.

16 And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he

him without the borders of the city
of his refuge, and the revenger of

And the chief fathers of the families
of the children of Gilead, the son of
Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the
families of the sons of Joseph, came
near, and spake before Moses, and
before the princes, the chief fathers
of the children of Israel:
2 And they said, The Lord commanded my lord to give the land
for an inheritance by lot to the
children of Israel: and my lord was
commanded by the Lord to give
the a inheritance of Zelophehad our
brother unto his daughters.
3 And if they be married to any
of the sons of the other tribes of the
children of Israel, then shall their
inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall
be a put to the inheritance of the
tribe whereunto they are received:
so shall it be taken from the lot of
our inheritance.
4 And when the a jubilee of the
children of Israel shall be, then
shall their b inheritance be put unto
the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall
their inheritance be taken away
from the inheritance of the tribe
of our fathers.
5 And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word
of the Lord, saying, The tribe of
the sons of Joseph hath said well.
6 This is the thing which the Lord
doth command concerning the
daughters of Zelophehad, saying,
Let them marry to whom they think
best; only to the family of the tribe
of their father shall they marry.
7 So shall not the inheritance of
the children of Israel remove from
tribe to tribe: for every one of the
children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe
of his fathers.

is with him.
17 Ye shall not a respect persons
in b judgment; but ye shall hear the
small as well as the great; ye shall
not be c afraid of the face of man;
for the judgment is God’s: and the
cause that is too hard for you, bring
it unto me, and I will hear it.
18 And I commanded you at that
time all the things which ye should
do.
19 ¶ And when we departed from
Horeb, we went through all that
great and terrible wilderness, which
ye saw by the way of the mountain
of the Amorites, as the Lord our
God commanded us; and we came
to Kadesh-barnea.
20 And I said unto you, Ye are
come unto the mountain of the
Amorites, which the Lord our God
doth give unto us.
21 Behold, the Lord thy God hath
set the land before thee: go up and
possess it, as the Lord God of thy
fathers hath said unto thee; fear
not, neither be discouraged.
22 ¶ And ye came near unto me
every one of you, and said, We will
send men before us, and they shall
search us out the land, and bring us
word again by what way we must
go up, and into what cities we shall
come.
23 And the saying pleased me well:
and I took a twelve men of you, one
of a tribe:
24 And they turned and went up
into the mountain, and came unto
the valley of Eshcol, and searched
it out.
25 And they took of the fruit of the
land in their hands, and brought it
down unto us, and brought us word

again, and said, It is a good land
which the Lord our God doth give
us.
26 Notwithstanding ye would not
go up, but a rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God:
27 And ye a murmured in your
tents, and said, Because the Lord
hated us, he hath brought us forth
out of the land of Egypt, to deliver
us into the hand of the Amorites,
to destroy us.
28 Whither shall we go up? our
brethren have discouraged our
heart, saying, The people is greater
and taller than we; the cities are
great and a walled up to heaven; and
moreover we have seen the sons of
the Anakims there.
29 Then I said unto you, Dread not,
neither be afraid of them.
30 The Lord your God which goeth before you, he shall a fight for
you, according to all that he did
for you in Egypt before your eyes;
31 And in the wilderness, where
thou hast seen how that the Lord
thy God bare thee, as a man doth
bear his son, in all the way that ye
went, until ye came into this place.
32 Yet in this thing ye did not a believe the Lord your God,
33 Who went in the way before
you, to search you out a place to
pitch your tents in, in fire by night,
to shew you by what way ye should
go, and in a a cloud by day.
34 And the Lord heard the voice
of your words, and a was wroth, and
sware, saying,
35 Surely there shall not one of
these men of this a evil generation
b 
see that good land, which I sware
to give unto your fathers,

37 Also the Lord was a angry with
me for your b sakes, saying, Thou
also shalt not go in thither.
38 But a Joshua the son of Nun,
which standeth before thee, he shall
go in thither: encourage him: for
he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
39 Moreover your little ones, which
ye said should be a prey, and your
children, which in that day had no
a 
knowledge between good and evil,
they shall go in thither, and unto
them will I give it, and they shall
possess it.
40 But as for you, turn you, and
take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
41 Then ye answered and said
unto me, We have a sinned against
the Lord, we will go up and fight,
according to all that the Lord our
God commanded us. And when ye
had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up
into the hill.
42 And the Lord said unto me,
Say unto them, Go not up, neither
fight; for I am not among you; lest
ye be smitten before your enemies.
43 So I spake unto you; and ye
would not hear, but rebelled against
the commandment of the Lord,
and a went presumptuously up into
the hill.
44 And the Amorites, which dwelt
in that mountain, came out against
you, and chased you, as a bees do,
and b destroyed you in Seir, even
unto Hormah.

46 So ye abode in Kadesh many
days, according unto the days that
ye abode there.
Chapter 2
The children of Israel press forward to
their promised land—They pass through
the lands of Esau and of Ammon in
peace but destroy the Amorites.
Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way
of the Red sea, as the Lord spake
unto me: and we compassed mount
a 
Seir many days.
2 And the Lord spake unto me,
saying,
3 Ye have a compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.
4 And command thou the people,
saying, Ye are to pass through the
coast of your brethren the children
of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and
they shall be afraid of you: take ye
good heed unto yourselves therefore:
5 Meddle not with them; for I will
not give you of their a land, no, not
so much as a foot b breadth; because
I have given mount c Seir unto Esau
for a possession.
6 Ye a shall buy meat of them for
money, that ye may eat; and ye shall
also buy water of them for money,
that ye may drink.
7 For the Lord thy God hath
blessed thee in all the works of
thy hand: he a knoweth thy walking
through this great wilderness: these
forty years the Lord thy God hath
been with thee; thou hast lacked
nothing.

our brethren the children of Esau,
which dwelt in Seir, through the

from Ezion-gaber, we turned and
passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
9 And the Lord said unto me,
Distress not the a Moabites, neither
contend with them in battle: for I
will not give thee of their land for
a possession; because I have given
b 
Ar unto the children of Lot for a
possession.
10 The a Emims dwelt therein in
times past, a people great, and many,
and tall, as the b Anakims;
11 Which also were accounted
a 
giants, as the b Anakims; but the
Moabites call them Emims.
12 The a Horims also dwelt in Seir
beforetime; but the children of Esau
b 
succeeded them, when they had
destroyed them from before them,
and dwelt in their stead; as Israel
did unto the land of his possession,
which the Lord gave unto them.
13 Now rise up, said I, and get you
over the brook Zered. And we went
over the brook Zered.
14 And the a space in which we
came from Kadesh-barnea, until we
were come over the brook Zered,
was thirty and eight years; until all
the generation of the b men of war
c 
were wasted out from among the
host, as the Lord sware unto them.
15 For indeed the hand of the
Lord was against them, to destroy
them from among the host, until
they were consumed.
16 ¶ So it came to pass, when all
the men of war were consumed and
dead from among the people,
17 That the Lord spake unto me,
saying,
18 Thou art to pass over through
Ar, the a coast of Moab, this day:

distress them not, nor meddle with
them: for I will not give thee of the
b 
land of the children of Ammon any
possession; because I have given it
unto the children of Lot for a possession.
20 (That also was accounted a land
of a giants: giants dwelt therein in
old time; and the Ammonites call
them b Zamzummims;
21 A people great, and many, and
tall, as the Anakims; but the Lord
destroyed them before them; and
they succeeded them, and dwelt in
their stead:
22 As he did to the children of
Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he
destroyed the Horims from before
them; and they succeeded them,
and dwelt in their stead even unto
this day:
23 And the Avims which dwelt
in a Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the
Caphtorims, which came forth out
of b Caphtor, destroyed them, and
dwelt in their stead.)
24 ¶ Rise ye up, take your journey,
and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand
Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess
it, and contend with him in battle.
25 This day will I begin to put the
dread of thee and the a fear of thee
upon the nations that are under the

of thee, and shall tremble, and be

Sihon king of Heshbon with words
of peace, saying,

will neither turn unto the right

my feet;
29 (As the children of Esau which
dwell in Seir, and the Moabites
which dwell in Ar, did unto me;)
until I shall pass over Jordan into
the land which the Lord our God
giveth us.
30 But Sihon king of Heshbon
would not let us pass by him: for the
Lord thy God a hardened his spirit,
and made his heart b obstinate, that
he might deliver him into thy hand,
as appeareth this day.
31 And the Lord said unto me,
Behold, I have begun to give Sihon
and his land before thee: begin to
possess, that thou mayest inherit
his land.
32 Then a Sihon came out against
us, he and all his people, to fight
at Jahaz.
33 And the Lord our God delivered
him before us; and we a smote him,
and his sons, and all his people.
34 And we took all his cities at
that time, and utterly a destroyed
the men, and the women, and the
little ones, of every city, we left
none to remain:
35 Only the cattle we took for a
prey unto ourselves, and the spoil
of the cities which we took.
36 From a Aroer, which is by the
brink of the river of Arnon, and
from the city that is by the river,
even unto Gilead, there was not one
city too strong for us: the Lord our
God b delivered all unto us:

unto any place of the river Jabbok,

nor unto whatsoever the Lord our

Chapter 3

The children of Israel destroy the people
of Bashan—Their lands, on the east of
the Jordan, are given to Reuben and
Gad—Moses sees Canaan from Pisgah but is denied entrance thereto—He
counsels and strengthens Joshua.
Then we turned, and went up the
way to Bashan: and Og the king of
Bashan came out against us, he and
all his people, to battle at Edrei.
2 And the Lord said unto me, Fear
him not: for I will deliver him, and
all his people, and his land, into thy
hand; and thou shalt do unto him
as thou didst unto Sihon king of the
Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.
3 So the Lord our God delivered
into our hands Og also, the king of
Bashan, and all his people: and we
a 
smote him until none was left to
him remaining.
4 And we took all his cities at that
time, there was not a city which
we took not from them, threescore
cities, all the region of Argob, the
kingdom of Og in Bashan.
5 All these cities were fenced with
high a walls, gates, and bars; beside
unwalled towns a great many.
6 And we utterly destroyed them,
as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men,
women, and children, of every city.
7 But all the cattle, and the spoil
of the cities, we took for a prey to
ourselves.
8 And we took at that time out of
the hand of the two kings of the
Amorites the land that was a on this

unto mount Hermon;

11 For only a Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of b giants;
behold, his bedstead was a bedstead
of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the
children of Ammon? nine c cubits
was the length thereof, and four

12 And this land, which we possessed at that time, from a Aroer,
which is by the river Arnon, and

18 ¶ And I commanded you at that
time, saying, The Lord your God
hath given you this land to possess
it: ye shall pass over armed before
your brethren the children of Israel, a all that are meet for the war.
19 But your wives, and your little
ones, and your cattle, (for I know
that ye have much cattle,) shall
abide in your cities which I have
given you;
20 Until the Lord have given a rest
unto your brethren, as well as unto
you, and until they also possess the
land which the Lord your God hath
given them beyond Jordan: and then
shall ye return every man unto his
possession, which I have given you.
21 ¶ And I commanded a Joshua at
that time, saying, Thine eyes have
seen all that the Lord your God hath
done unto these two kings: so shall
the Lord do unto all the kingdoms
whither thou passest.
22 Ye shall not fear them: for the
Lord your God he shall a fight for
you.
23 And I besought the Lord at that
time, saying,
24 O Lord God, thou hast begun
to shew thy servant thy greatness,
and thy mighty a hand: for what God
is there in heaven or in earth, that
can do according to thy works, and
according to thy might?
25 I pray thee, let me go over, and
see the good land that is beyond
Jordan, that goodly mountain, and
a 
Lebanon.
26 But the Lord was a wroth with
me for your b sakes, and would not
hear me: and the Lord said unto
me, Let it suffice thee; speak no
more unto me of this matter.

Moses exhorts the children of Israel to
keep the commandments, to teach them
to their children, and to be exemplary
before all nations—They are forbidden
to make graven images or worship other
gods—They are to witness that they have
heard the voice of God—They will be
scattered among all nations when they
worship other gods—They will be gathered again in the latter days when they
seek the Lord their God—Moses extols
the mercy and goodness of God to Israel.
Now therefore hearken, O Israel,
unto the a statutes and unto the
b 
judgments, which I teach you, for
to do them, that ye may live, and go
in and possess the land which the
Lord God of your fathers giveth you.
2 Ye shall not a add unto the word
which I command you, neither shall
ye diminish ought from it, that ye
may keep the commandments of

for this is your a wisdom and your
b 
understanding in the sight of the
c 
nations, which shall hear all these

7 For what a nation is there so great,

21 Furthermore the Lord was
angry with me for your sakes, and
sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto
that good land, which the Lord thy
God giveth thee for an inheritance:
22 But I must die in this land, I
must not go over Jordan: but ye shall
go over, and possess that good land.
23 Take heed unto yourselves, lest
ye a forget the b covenant of the Lord
your God, which he made with you,
and make you a graven image, or
the likeness of any thing, which the
Lord thy God hath forbidden thee.
24 For the Lord thy God is a consuming a fire, even a b jealous God.
25 ¶ When thou shalt beget children, and children’s children, and
ye shall have remained long in the
land, and shall corrupt yourselves,
and make a graven image, or the
likeness of any thing, and shall do
a 
evil in the sight of the Lord thy
God, to provoke him to b anger:
26 I call a  heaven and earth to
witness against you this day, that
ye shall soon utterly perish from
off the land whereunto ye go over
b 
Jordan to possess it; ye shall not
prolong your days upon it, but shall
c 
utterly be destroyed.
27 And the Lord shall a scatter you
among the nations, and ye shall be
left few in number b among the heathen, whither the Lord shall lead you.
28 And there ye shall serve a gods,
the work of men’s hands, wood and
stone, which neither b see, nor hear,
nor eat, nor smell.

37 And because he a  loved thy
fathers, therefore he chose their seed
after them, and brought thee out
in his sight with his mighty power
out of b Egypt;
38 To a drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than
thou art, to bring thee in, to give
thee their land for an b inheritance,
as it is this day.
39 Know therefore this day, and
consider it in thine heart, that the
Lord he is a God in heaven above,
and upon the earth beneath: there is
none else.
40 Thou shalt a keep therefore his
statutes, and his commandments,
which I command thee this day,
that it may go well with thee, and

that thou mayest b prolong thy c days
upon the d earth, which the Lord
thy God giveth thee, for ever.

24 And the Lord a commanded us
to do all these statutes, to b fear the
Lord our God, for our c good always,
that he might d preserve us alive, as
it is at this day.
25 And it shall be our a righteousness, if we b observe to do all these

our God, as he hath commanded us.
Chapter 7
Israel is to destroy the seven nations
of Canaan—Marriages with them are
forbidden lest apostasy result—Israel
has a mission as a holy and chosen
people—The Lord shows mercy unto
those who love Him and keep His commandments—He promises to remove
sickness from the children of Israel if
they obey.
When the Lord thy God shall bring
thee into the land whither thou
goest to possess it, and hath cast
out many nations before thee, the
Hittites, and the Girgashites, and
the Amorites, and the Canaanites,
and the Perizzites, and the Hivites,
and the Jebusites, seven a nations
greater and mightier than thou;
2 And when the Lord thy God
shall deliver them before thee;
thou shalt smite them, and utterly
a 
destroy them; thou shalt b make
no c covenant with them, nor shew
mercy unto them:

ye shall a destroy their altars, and

unto the Lord thy God: the Lord
thy God hath c chosen thee to be a

your fathers, hath the Lord brought
you out with a mighty hand, and

redeemed you out of the house of

raoh king of Egypt.

thy God, he is God, the faithful
God, which a keepeth covenant and

and keep his commandments to a
thousand generations;
10 And a repayeth them that hate

12 ¶ Wherefore it shall come to
pass, if ye a hearken to these b judgments, and keep, and do them, that
the Lord thy God shall keep unto
thee the c covenant and the mercy
which he sware unto thy fathers:
13 And he will a love thee, and bless
thee, and b multiply thee: he will
also bless the fruit of thy womb,
and the c fruit of thy land, thy d corn,
and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks
of thy sheep, in the land which he
sware unto thy fathers to give thee.
14 Thou shalt be blessed above
all people: there shall not be male
or female a barren among you, or
among your cattle.
15 And the Lord will take away
from thee all a sickness, and will
put none of the evil b diseases of
Egypt, which thou knowest, upon
thee; but will lay them upon all
them that hate thee.
16 And thou shalt consume all the
people which the Lord thy God shall
deliver thee; thine eye shall have no
pity upon them: neither shalt thou
serve their a gods; for that will be a
snare unto thee.
17 If thou shalt say in thine heart,
These nations are more than I; how
can I dispossess them?
18 Thou shalt not be afraid of
them: but shalt well remember what
the Lord thy God did unto Pharaoh,
and unto all Egypt;

21 Thou shalt not be affrighted at

22 And the Lord thy God will a put
out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the b beasts

destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.

there shall no man be able to stand
before thee, until thou have destroyed them.
25 The graven images of their gods
shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt
not desire the silver or gold that is
on them, nor take it unto thee, lest
thou be snared therein: for it is an
abomination to the Lord thy God.

abomination into thine house, lest
thou be a cursed thing like it: but
thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou
shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a
cursed thing.

land which the Lord sware unto
your fathers.
2 And thou shalt remember all
the way which the Lord thy God
led thee these forty years in the
wilderness, to a humble thee, and to
b 
prove thee, to know what was in
thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.
3 And he a humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee
with b manna, which thou knewest
not, neither did thy fathers know;
that he might make thee know that
c 
man doth not live by d bread only,
but by every e word that proceedeth
out of the mouth of the Lord doth

to wrath in the wilderness: from

of the land of Egypt, until ye came
unto this place, ye have been a rebellious against the Lord.
8 Also in Horeb ye provoked the
Lord to wrath, so that the Lord
was angry with you a to have b destroyed you.

which the Lord made with you,
then I abode in the mount a forty

me two tables of stone a written with

12 And the Lord said unto me,
Arise, get thee down quickly from
hence; for thy people which thou
hast brought forth out of Egypt
have a corrupted themselves; they
are quickly turned aside out of the
way which I commanded them;
they have made them a molten
image.
13 Furthermore the Lord spake
unto me, saying, I have seen this
people, and, behold, it is a a stiffnecked people:
14 Let me alone, that I may a destroy them, and b  blot out their
name from under heaven: and I will
make of thee a nation mightier and
greater than they.
15 So I turned and came down
from the mount, and the mount
burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two
hands.
16 And I a looked, and, behold, ye
had b sinned against the Lord your
God, and had made you a molten
calf: ye had turned aside quickly
out of the way which the Lord had
commanded you.
17 And I took the two tables, and
cast them out of my two hands, and
brake them before your eyes.
18 And I a fell down before the
Lord, as at the first, forty days
and forty nights: I did neither eat
bread, nor drink water, because
of all your sins which ye sinned,
in doing b wickedly in the sight of
the Lord, to provoke him to c anger.
19 For I was afraid of the anger
and hot displeasure, wherewith the
Lord was wroth against you to a destroy you. But the Lord b hearkened
unto me at that time also.
20 And the Lord was very a angry with Aaron to have destroyed

him: and I prayed for Aaron also
the same time.
21 And I took your a sin, the calf
which ye had made, and burnt
it with fire, and b stamped it, and
ground it very small, even until it
was as small as dust: and I cast the
dust thereof into the brook that
descended out of the mount.
22 And at Taberah, and at Massah,
and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye a provoked the Lord to wrath.
23 Likewise when the Lord sent
you from Kadesh-barnea, saying,
Go up and possess the land which
I have given you; then ye a rebelled
against the commandment of the
Lord your God, and ye believed
him not, nor hearkened to his
voice.
24 Ye have been a rebellious against
the Lord from the day that I knew
you.
25 Thus I fell down before the Lord
forty days and forty nights, as I fell
down at the first; because the Lord
had said he would destroy you.
26 I a prayed therefore unto the
Lord, and said, O Lord God, destroy
not thy people and thine b inheritance, which thou hast redeemed
through thy greatness, which thou
hast brought forth out of Egypt with
a mighty hand.
27 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto
the a stubbornness of this people,
nor to their wickedness, nor to
their sin:
28 Lest the a land whence thou
broughtest us out say, Because the

them, and because he hated them,
he hath brought them out to slay

All that God requires is that Israel love

2 And I will a write on the tables

in the priest’s office in his stead.
7 From thence they journeyed unto

8 ¶ At that time the Lord a separated the tribe of b Levi, to c bear the

stand before the Lord to minister

that therein is.
15 a Only the Lord had a delight
in thy fathers to b love them, and he
c 
chose their seed after them, even
you above all people, as it is this day.
16 a Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your b heart, and be no more
c 
stiffnecked.
17 For the Lord your a God is b God
of gods, and c Lord of lords, a great
God, a mighty, and a terrible, d which
e 
regardeth not persons, nor taketh
f 
reward:
18 He a doth execute the judgment
of the fatherless and widow, and
b 
loveth the c stranger, in giving him
d 
food and raiment.
19 a Love ye therefore the b stranger:
for ye were strangers in the land
of Egypt.
20 Thou shalt fear the Lord thy
God; him shalt thou serve, and to
him shalt thou a cleave, and b swear
by his name.
21 He is thy praise, and he is thy
God, that hath done for thee these
a 
great and terrible things, which
thine eyes have seen.
22 Thy a fathers went down into
Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the Lord thy God
hath made thee as the b stars of

you this day, that ye may be a strong,
and go in and b possess the land,
whither ye go to possess it;
9 And that ye may a prolong your
days in the land, which the Lord
sware unto your b fathers to give
unto them and to their seed, a land
that floweth with milk and honey.
10 ¶ For the land, whither thou
goest in to possess it, is not as the
land of Egypt, from whence ye came
out, where thou sowedst thy seed,
and wateredst it with thy foot, as
a garden of a herbs:
11 But the a land, whither ye go
to possess it, is a land of hills and
valleys, and drinketh water of the
rain of heaven:
12 A land which the Lord thy God
careth for: the eyes of the Lord thy
God are always upon it, from the
beginning of the year even unto
the end of the year.
13 ¶ And it shall come to pass, if
ye shall hearken diligently unto my
commandments which I command
you this day, to a love the Lord your
God, and to b serve him with all your
heart and with all your soul,
14 That I will give you the a rain
of your land in his due season, the
b 
first rain and the c latter rain, that
thou mayest gather in thy d corn,
and thy wine, and thine oil.
15 And I will send grass in thy
fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.

kindled against you, and he a shut
up the heaven, that there be no
rain, and that the land yield not
her fruit; and lest ye b perish quickly
from off the good land which the
Lord giveth you.
18 ¶ Therefore shall ye a lay up
these my b words in your c heart and
in your soul, and bind them for a
sign upon your d hand, that they may
be as e frontlets between your eyes.
19 And ye shall a teach them your

children, speaking of them when
thou sittest in thine house, and
when thou walkest by the way,
when thou liest down, and when
thou risest up.
20 And thou shalt write them upon
the a door posts of thine house, and

21 That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your a children,
in the land which the Lord sware
unto your fathers to give them, b as

all these commandments which I
command you, to do them, to love
the Lord your God, to a walk in all
his ways, and to cleave unto him;

all these nations from before you,

Chapter 14
The Israelites are children of the Lord
Jehovah—Unclean beasts, fish, and
fowl are not to be eaten—The Israelites are to tithe all the increase of their
seed annually.
Ye are the a children of the Lord your
God: ye shall b not c cut yourselves,
nor make any baldness d between
your eyes for the dead.
2 For thou art an a holy people unto
the Lord thy God, and the Lord
hath chosen thee to be a b peculiar
people unto himself, above all the
nations that are upon the earth.
3 ¶ Thou shalt not a eat any abomi­
nable thing.
4 These are the beasts which ye shall
a 
eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,
5 The hart, and the a roebuck, and
the fallow deer, and the wild goat,
and the pygarg, and the wild ox,
and the chamois.
6 And every beast that parteth the
hoof, and a cleaveth the cleft into
two claws, and cheweth the cud
among the beasts, that ye shall eat.
7 Nevertheless these ye shall not
eat of them that chew the cud, or
of them that divide the cloven hoof;
as the camel, and the hare, and the
coney: for they chew the cud, but
divide not the hoof; therefore they
are unclean unto you.
8 And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the
cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall
not eat of their flesh, nor touch
their dead carcase.
9 ¶ These ye shall eat of all that
are in the waters: all that have fins
and scales shall ye eat:
10 And whatsoever hath not fins
and scales ye may not eat; it is unclean unto you.
11 ¶ Of all clean birds ye shall eat.
12 But these are they of which ye

and the bat.
19 And every a creeping thing that
flieth is unclean unto you: they
shall not be eaten.
20 But of all clean fowls ye may eat.
21 ¶ Ye shall not eat of any thing
that dieth of itself: thou shalt a give
it unto the stranger that is in thy
gates, that he may eat it; or thou
mayest b sell it unto an alien: for thou
art an holy people unto the Lord
thy God. Thou shalt not c seethe a
kid in his mother’s milk.
22 Thou shalt truly a tithe all the
increase of thy seed, that the field
bringeth forth year by year.
23 And thou shalt eat before the
Lord thy God, in the place which
he shall choose to place his name
there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy
wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks;
that thou mayest learn to fear the
Lord thy God always.
24 And if the way be too long for
thee, so that thou art not able to
carry it; or if the place be too far
from thee, which the Lord thy God
shall choose to set his name there,
when the Lord thy God hath blessed
thee:

thou shalt eat there before the Lord
thy God, and thou shalt rejoice,
thou, and thine household,
27 And the Levite that is within
thy gates; thou shalt not forsake
him; for he hath no part nor inheri­

shalt bring forth all the a tithe of
thine increase the same year, and
shalt lay it up within thy gates:
29 And the Levite, (because he hath
no part nor inheritance with thee,)

Every seven years, all debts are to be

to care for the poor—Hebrew servants
are to be released and given gifts during
the seventh year—The firstling males of

At the end of every a seven years
thou shalt make a b release.
2 And this is the manner of the
a 
release: Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall
release it; he shall not exact it of his
neighbour, or of his brother; because
it is called the Lord’s release.

the Lord thy God giveth thee for an
inheritance to possess it:
5 Only if thou carefully hearken
unto the voice of the Lord thy God,
to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this
day.
6 For the Lord thy God blesseth
thee, as he promised thee: and thou
shalt lend unto many nations, but
thou shalt not a borrow; and thou
shalt reign over many nations, but
they shall not reign over thee.
7 ¶ If there be among you a poor
man of one of thy brethren within
any of thy a gates in thy land which
the Lord thy God giveth thee, thou
shalt not b harden thine heart, nor
shut thine hand from thy c poor
d 
brother:
8 But thou shalt open thine a hand
wide unto him, and shalt surely
lend him sufficient for his need,
in that which he b wanteth.
9 Beware that there be not a
thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of
release, is at hand; and thine a eye
be evil against thy poor brother,
and thou givest him nought; and
he b cry unto the Lord against thee,
and it be sin unto thee.
10 Thou shalt surely give him, and
thine heart shall not be grieved
when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the Lord
thy God shall bless thee in all thy
works, and in all that thou puttest
thine hand unto.

man, or an Hebrew woman, be a sold
unto thee, and serve thee six years;
then in the seventh year thou shalt
let him go free from thee.
13 And when thou sendest him
out free from thee, thou shalt not
let him go away empty:
14 Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy
a 
floor, and out of thy winepress: of
that wherewith the Lord thy God
hath blessed thee thou shalt give
unto him.
15 And thou shalt a remember that
thou wast a bondman in the land
of Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command
thee this thing to day.
16 And it shall be, if he say unto
thee, I will not go away from thee;
because he loveth thee and thine
house, because he is well with thee;
17 Then thou shalt take an awl,
and thrust it through his a ear unto
the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy
maidservant thou shalt do likewise.
18 It shall not seem hard unto
thee, when thou sendest him away
free from thee; for he hath been
a 
worth a double hired servant to
thee, in serving thee six years: and
the Lord thy God shall bless thee
in all that thou doest.
19 ¶ All the a firstling males that
come of thy herd and of thy flock
thou shalt b sanctify unto the Lord
thy God: thou shalt do no work
with the firstling of thy c bullock,

Israel is to keep the Passover, the Feast
of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of

All males are to appear annually before
the Lord at these three feasts—Judges
are not to make dishonest judgments
nor take gifts.
Observe the month of a Abib, and
keep the b passover unto the Lord
thy God: for in the month of Abib
the Lord thy God brought thee
forth out of Egypt by night.
2 Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the
a 
passover unto the Lord thy God,
of the flock and the herd, in the
b 
place which the Lord shall choose
to place his name there.
3 Thou shalt eat no a leavened bread
with it; seven days shalt thou eat
b 
unleavened bread therewith, even
the bread of affliction; for thou
camest forth out of the land of
Egypt in c haste: that thou mayest
remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt
all the days of thy life.
4 And there shall be no a leavened
bread seen with thee in all thy b coast
seven days; neither shall there any

like unto Moses.
The priests the Levites, and all the
tribe of Levi, shall have no a part
nor b inheritance with Israel: they
shall c eat the offerings of the Lord
made by fire, and his inheritance.
2 Therefore shall they have no
inheritance among their brethren:
the Lord is their a inheritance, as
he hath said unto them.
3 ¶ And this shall be the priest’s
a

that offer a sacrifice, whether it be

the priest the shoulder, and the two
cheeks, and the b maw.
4 The a firstfruit also of thy b corn,

shalt thou give him.

4 ¶ And this is the case of the
slayer, which shall flee thither,
that he may live: Whoso killeth
his neighbour a ignorantly, whom
he hated not in time past;
5 As when a man goeth into the
wood with his neighbour to hew
wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke
with the axe to cut down the tree,
and the head slippeth from the
helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto
one of those cities, and live:
6 Lest the a avenger of the blood
pursue the slayer, while his heart is
hot, and overtake him, because the
way is long, and slay him; whereas he
was not worthy of death, inasmuch
as he hated him not in time past.
7 Wherefore I command thee,
saying, Thou shalt separate three
cities for thee.
8 And if the Lord thy God enlarge
thy a coast, as he hath sworn unto
thy fathers, and give thee all the
land which he promised to give
unto thy fathers;
9 If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I
command thee this day, to love the
Lord thy God, and to a walk ever
in his ways; then shalt thou add
three cities more for thee, beside
these three:
10 That innocent blood be not
shed in thy land, which the Lord
thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.
11 ¶ But if any man hate his a neighbour, and b lie in wait for him, and
rise up against him, and smite him
mortally that he die, and fleeth into
one of these cities:
12 Then the elders of his city shall
send and fetch him thence, and
deliver him into the hand of the
avenger of blood, that he may die.

10 ¶ When thou comest nigh unto
a city to a fight against it, then proclaim b peace unto it.
11 And it shall be, if it make thee
answer of peace, and open unto
thee, then it shall be, that all the
people that is found therein shall
be a tributaries unto thee, and they

12 And if it will make no peace
with thee, but will make war against
thee, then thou shalt besiege it:

hath delivered it into thine hands,
thou shalt smite every male thereof
with the edge of the sword:
14 But the women, and the little
ones, and the cattle, and all that is
in the city, even all the spoil thereof,
shalt thou take unto thyself; and
thou shalt a eat the spoil of thine
enemies, which the Lord thy God
hath given thee.

Deuteronomy 22:1–20
Chapter 22

Moses sets forth laws pertaining to lost
property, wearing of proper clothes,
caring for interests of others, marrying
virgins, and sexual immorality.
Thou shalt not see thy a brother’s
ox or his sheep go b astray, and
hide thyself from them: thou shalt
in any case bring them again unto
thy brother.
2 And if thy brother a be not nigh
unto thee, or if thou know him not,
then thou shalt bring it unto thine
own house, and it shall be with thee
until thy brother seek after it, and
thou shalt restore it to him again.
3 In like manner shalt thou do
with his ass; and so shalt thou do
with his raiment; and with all a lost
thing of thy brother’s, which he
hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt
thou do likewise: thou mayest not
hide thyself.
4 ¶ Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ass or his ox fall down by the
way, and hide thyself from them:
thou shalt surely a help him to lift
them up again.
5 ¶ The woman shall not a wear
that which pertaineth unto a man,
neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment: for all that do so are
abomination unto the Lord thy
God.
6 ¶ If a bird’s nest chance to be
before thee in the way in any tree,
or on the ground, whether they be
young ones, or eggs, and the a dam
sitting upon the young, or upon the
eggs, thou shalt not take the b dam
with the young:
7 But thou shalt in any wise let the
dam go, and take the young to thee;
that it may be well with thee, and
that thou mayest a prolong thy days.
8 ¶ When thou buildest a new
house, then thou shalt make a a bat22	1	a	 tg  Brotherhood and

man fall from thence.
9 ¶ Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with a divers seeds: lest the
fruit of thy seed which thou hast
sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard,
be defiled.
10 ¶ Thou shalt not plow with an
ox and an ass together.
11 ¶ Thou shalt not wear a garment
of a divers sorts, as of woollen and

12 ¶ Thou shalt make thee a fringes
upon the four quarters of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.
13 ¶ If any man take a wife, and
go in unto her, and a hate her,
14 And a give occasions of speech
against her, and bring up an evil
name upon her, and say, I took this
woman, and when I came to her, I
found her not a b maid:
15 Then shall the father of the
damsel, and her mother, take and
bring forth the tokens of the damsel’s
virginity unto the elders of the city
in the gate:
16 And the damsel’s father shall say
unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he
hateth her;
17 And, lo, he hath given occasions
of speech against her, saying, I found
not thy daughter a maid; and yet
these are the tokens of my daughter’s
virginity. And they shall spread the
cloth before the elders of the city.
18 And the elders of that city shall
take that man and chastise him;
19 And they shall a amerce him in
an hundred shekels of silver, and give
them unto the father of the damsel,
because he hath brought up an evil

3 An a Ammonite or Moabite shall
not enter into the congregation of
the Lord; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the
congregation of the Lord for ever:

when ye came forth out of Egypt;
and because they hired against thee

Deuteronomy 23:9–24:1

9 ¶ When a the host goeth forth
against thine enemies, then keep
thee from every wicked thing.
10 ¶ If there be among you any
man, that is not clean by reason
of uncleanness that chanceth him
by night, then shall he go abroad
out of the camp, he shall not come
within the camp:
11 But it shall be, when evening
cometh on, he shall wash himself with
water: and when the sun is down,
he shall come into the camp again.
12 ¶ Thou shalt have a place also
without the camp, whither thou
shalt go forth abroad:
13 And thou shalt have a paddle
upon thy weapon; and it shall be,
when thou wilt ease thyself abroad,
thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt
turn back and cover a that which
cometh from thee:
14 For the Lord thy God a walketh
in the b midst of thy camp, to deliver
thee, and to give up thine enemies
before thee; therefore shall thy
camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away
from thee.
15 ¶ Thou shalt not deliver unto
his a master the servant which is
escaped from his master unto thee:
16 He shall dwell with thee, even
among you, in that place which he
shall choose in one of thy a gates,
where it liketh him best: thou shalt
not oppress him.
17 ¶ There shall be no a whore of
the daughters of Israel, nor b a sodomite of the sons of Israel.
18 Thou shalt not bring the hire
of a whore, or the price of a dog,
into the house of the Lord thy God
for any vow: for even both these are
abomination unto the Lord thy God.

brother thou shalt not b lend upon
usury: that the Lord thy God may
bless thee in all that thou settest
thine hand to in the land whither
thou goest to possess it.
21 ¶ When thou shalt a vow a b vow
unto the Lord thy God, thou shalt
not slack to pay it: for the Lord thy
God will surely require it of thee;
and it would be sin in thee.
22 But if thou shalt forbear to vow,
it shall be no sin in thee.
23 That which is gone out of thy
lips thou shalt keep and perform;
even a freewill offering, according
as thou hast vowed unto the Lord
thy God, which thou hast promised
with thy mouth.
24 ¶ When thou comest into thy
neighbour’s vineyard, then thou
mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine
own pleasure; but thou shalt not
put any in thy vessel.

then thou mayest pluck the b ears

move a sickle unto thy neighbour’s
standing corn.

3 And if the latter husband hate

sendeth her out of his house; or if
the latter husband die, which took
her to be his wife;
4 Her former husband, which sent
her away, may not take her again
to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before
the Lord: and thou shalt not a cause
the land to sin, which the Lord thy
God giveth thee for an inheritance.
5 ¶ When a man hath taken a new
a 
wife, he shall not go out to war,
neither shall he be charged with

he taketh a man’s life to pledge.
7 ¶ If a man be found a stealing

of Israel, and maketh b merchandise
of him, or selleth him; then that
thief shall die; and thou shalt put

Judges prescribe punishment for the

for a brother’s widow—Just weights
and measures are required—Israel is
commanded to blot out the Amalekites
from under heaven.
If there be a a controversy between
men, and they come unto b judgment,
that the judges may judge them; then
they shall c justify the righteous, and
condemn the wicked.
2 And it shall be, if the wicked man
be worthy to be a beaten, that the judge
shall cause him to lie down, and to
be beaten before his face, according
to his fault, by a certain b number.

6 And it shall be, that the firstborn
which she beareth shall succeed

7 And if the man like not to take his
brother’s wife, then let his brother’s
wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband’s brother
refuseth to raise up unto his brother
a name in Israel, he will not perform
the duty of my husband’s brother.
8 Then the elders of his city shall
call him, and speak unto him: and
if he a stand to it, and say, I like not
to take her;

The children of Israel are to cross the

And Moses with the a elders of Israel commanded the people, saying,

Keep all the commandments which

2 And it shall be on the day when

4 Therefore it shall be when ye be
gone over Jordan, that ye shall set
up these stones, which I command
you this day, in mount Ebal, and
thou shalt plaster them with plaster.
5 And there shalt thou build an

spiritually—If they are disobedient, they
will be cursed, smitten, and destroyed;

nations; fierce nations will enslave them;
and they will eat their own children and

The children of Israel make a covenant
with the Lord under which they will
be blessed if they are obedient, and
cursed if they are disobedient—If they
are disobedient, their land will be as
brimstone and salt.
These are the words of the a covenant, which the Lord commanded
Moses to make with the children of
Israel in the land of Moab, beside
the covenant which he made with
them in Horeb.
2 ¶ And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have
seen all that the Lord did before
your eyes in the land of Egypt unto
Pharaoh, and unto all his servants,
and unto all his land;
3 The great a temptations which
thine eyes have seen, the signs, and
those great b miracles:
4 Yet the Lord hath not given you
an heart to perceive, and eyes to
see, and ears to hear, unto this day.

of Israel,

Deuteronomy 30:12–31:9

12 It is not in heaven, that thou
shouldest say, Who shall go up for
us to heaven, and bring it unto us,
that we may hear it, and do it?
13 Neither is it beyond the sea,
that thou shouldest say, Who shall
go over the sea for us, and bring it
unto us, that we may hear it, and
do it?
14 But the word is very nigh unto
thee, in thy mouth, and in thy a heart,
that thou mayest do it.
15 ¶ See, I have set before thee
this day a life and good, and death
and b evil;
16 In that I command thee this day
to love the Lord thy God, to a walk
in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his
b 
judgments, that thou mayest live
and multiply: and the Lord thy God
shall bless thee in the land whither
thou goest to possess it.
17 But if thine heart turn away, so
that thou wilt not hear, but shalt
be drawn away, and worship other
gods, and serve them;
18 I a denounce unto you this day,
that ye shall surely perish, and that
ye shall not prolong your days upon
the land, whither thou passest over
Jordan to go to possess it.
19 I call heaven and earth to record
this day against you, that I have set
before you life and death, blessing
and a cursing: therefore b choose life,
that both thou and thy seed may
live:
20 That thou mayest love the
Lord thy God, and that thou mayest a obey his voice, and that thou
mayest cleave unto him: for he is
thy b life, and the length of thy days:
that thou mayest dwell in the land
which the Lord sware unto thy
fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and
to Jacob, to give them.

Moses counsels Joshua and all Israel
to be strong and of good courage—The
law is to be read to all Israel every seven
years—The children of Israel will follow false gods and corrupt themselves.
And Moses went and spake these
words unto all Israel.
2 And he said unto them, I am an
a 
hundred and twenty years old this
day; I can no more go out and come
in: also the Lord hath said unto me,
Thou shalt not b go over this Jordan.
3 The Lord thy God, he will go
over before thee, and he will destroy these nations from before
thee, and thou shalt a possess them:
and Joshua, he shall go over before
thee, as the Lord hath said.
4 And the Lord shall do unto them
as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings
of the Amorites, and unto the land
of them, whom he a destroyed.
5 And the Lord shall give them
up before your face, that ye may
do unto them according unto all
the commandments which I have
commanded you.
6 Be strong and of a good a courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them:
for the b Lord thy God, he it is that
doth go with thee; he will not c fail
thee, nor d forsake thee.
7 ¶ And Moses called unto a Joshua,
and said unto him in the sight of
all Israel, Be strong and of a good
courage: for thou must go with this
people unto the land which the
Lord hath sworn unto their fathers
to give them; and thou shalt cause
them to inherit it.
8 And the Lord, he it is that doth
go before thee; he will be a with thee,
he will not fail thee, neither forsake
thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.

and delivered it unto the priests the
sons of Levi, which bare the ark of
the covenant of the Lord, and unto
all the b elders of Israel.
10 And Moses commanded them,
saying, At the end of every seven
years, a in the solemnity of the year of
b 
release, in the feast of tabernacles,
11 When all Israel is a come to appear before the Lord thy God in
the b place which he shall choose,
thou shalt c read this d law before all
Israel in their hearing.
12 Gather the people together,
men, and women, and children,
and thy a stranger that is within
thy gates, that they may hear, and
that they may learn, and fear the
Lord your God, and observe to do
all the words of this law:
13 And that their children, which
have not known any thing, may hear,
and a learn to fear the Lord your God,
as long as ye live in the land whither
ye go over Jordan to possess it.
14 ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, thy a days approach that
thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the b tabernacle of
the congregation, that I may give
him a charge. And Moses and Joshua
went, and presented themselves in
the tabernacle of the congregation.
15 And the Lord appeared in the
tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and
the pillar of the cloud stood over
the door of the tabernacle.
16 ¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with
thy fathers; and this people will
rise up, and go a a whoring after the
b 
gods of the strangers of the land,
whither they go to be among them,
and will forsake me, and c break
my covenant which I have made
with them.

17 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and
I will forsake them, and I will a hide
my face from them, and they shall
be devoured, and many evils and
troubles shall befall them; so that
they will say in that day, Are not
these evils come upon us, because
our God is not among us?
18 And I will surely hide my a face
in that day for all the evils which
they shall have wrought, in that
they are turned unto other gods.
19 Now therefore a write ye this
b 
song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths,
that this song may be a witness for
me against the children of Israel.
20 For when I shall have brought
them into the land which I sware
unto their fathers, that floweth
with milk and honey; and they shall
have eaten and filled themselves,
and waxen fat; then will they turn
unto other gods, and serve them,
and a provoke me, and break my
covenant.
21 And it shall come to pass, when
many evils and troubles are befallen
them, that this a song shall testify
against them as a witness; for it shall
not be forgotten out of the mouths of
their seed: for I know b their imagi­
nation which they go about, even
now, before I have brought them
into the land which I sware.
22 ¶ Moses therefore wrote this
song the same day, and taught it
the children of Israel.
23 And he gave Joshua the son of
Nun a a charge, and said, Be strong
and of a good courage: for thou shalt
bring the children of Israel into the
land which I sware unto them: and
I will be with thee.

Deuteronomy 31:25–32:9

Moses had made an end of writing
the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,
25 That Moses commanded the
Levites, which bare the ark of the
covenant of the Lord, saying,
26 Take this a book of the b law, and
put it in the side of the c ark of the
covenant of the Lord your God,
that it may be there for a d witness
against thee.
27 For I know thy a rebellion, and
thy b stiff neck: behold, while I am
yet alive with you this day, ye have
been rebellious against the Lord;
and how much more after my death?
28 ¶ Gather unto me all the elders
of your tribes, and your officers, that
I may speak these words in their
ears, and call heaven and earth to
record against them.
29 For I know that after my death
ye will utterly a corrupt yourselves,
and turn aside from the way which
I have commanded you; and evil
will befall you in the b latter days;
because ye will do evil in the sight
of the Lord, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.
30 And Moses spake in the ears
of all the congregation of Israel
the words of this song, until they
were ended.
Chapter 32
Israel will sing the song of Moses and
acclaim: God speaks to heaven and

10 He found him in a desert land,

b

11 As an a eagle stirreth up her nest,
fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them,
beareth them on her wings:
12 So the Lord alone did lead
him, and there was no strange god
with him.
13 He made him ride on the a high
places of the earth, that he might
eat the increase of the fields; and he
made him to suck honey out of the
rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;
14 Butter of kine, and milk of

of the breed of Bashan, and goats,
with the fat of kidneys of wheat;

30 How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand
to a flight, except their Rock had

31 For their rock is not as our a Rock,

49 Get thee up into this mountain
Abarim, unto mount a Nebo, which
is in the land of Moab, that is b over
against Jericho; and behold the land
of Canaan, which I give unto the
children of Israel for a possession:
50 And a die in the mount whither
thou goest up, and be gathered unto
thy people; as b Aaron thy brother
died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:
51 Because ye a trespassed against
me among the children of Israel at
the waters of b Meribah-Kadesh, in
the wilderness of Zin; because ye
sanctified me not in the midst of
the children of Israel.
52 Yet thou shalt see the land
before thee; but thou shalt not go
thither unto the land which I give
the children of Israel.
Chapter 33
Moses blesses the tribes of Israel—Levi
is blessed to teach the Lord’s judgments
and His law—Joseph is blessed above
all; the Lord will gather Israel in the
latter days—Israel will triumph.
And this is the blessing, wherewith
a 
Moses the b man of God c blessed the
children of d Israel before his death.
2 And he said, The Lord came
from Sinai, and rose up from Seir
unto them; he a shined forth from
mount b Paran, and he came with
ten thousands of saints: from his
right hand went a fiery law for
them.
3 Yea, he loved the people; all his

saints are in thy hand: and they
sat down at thy b feet; every one shall
receive of thy words.

Meribah;

of the Lord be his b land, for the
c 
precious things of heaven, for the
dew, and for the deep that coucheth
beneath,
14 And for the precious fruits brought
forth by the sun, and for the precious
things put forth by the moon,
15 And for the chief things of the
ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting a hills,
16 And for the precious things of
the earth and fulness thereof, and
for the good will of him that dwelt

separated from his brethren.
17 His a glory is like the firstling of

the horns of b unicorns: with them
he shall c push the people together

are the ten thousands of d Ephraim,
and they are the thousands of Manasseh.

and, b Issachar, in thy tents.
19 They shall call the people unto
the mountain; there they shall offer
sacrifices of righteousness: for they
shall suck of the abundance of the
seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.

be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm

And Moses went up from the plains
of Moab unto the mountain of
Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is
a 
over against Jericho. And the Lord
shewed him all the land of Gilead,
unto Dan,
2 And all Naphtali, and the land of
Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the
land of Judah, unto a the utmost sea,
3 And the a south, and the plain
of the valley of b Jericho, the city
of palm trees, unto Zoar.
4 And the Lord said unto him,
This is the land which I a sware unto
Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy
seed: I have caused thee to see it
with thine eyes, but thou shalt not
go over thither.
5 ¶ So a Moses the servant of the
Lord b died there in the land of
Moab, according to the word of
the Lord.
6 And he a buried him in a valley
in the land of Moab, over against
Beth-peor: but no man knoweth b of
his c sepulchre unto this day.

308
7 ¶ And Moses was an a hundred
and twenty years old when he died:
his eye was not dim, nor his natural
force abated.
8 ¶ And the children of Israel
wept for Moses in the plains of
Moab thirty days: so the days of
weeping and a mourning for Moses
were ended.
9 ¶ And Joshua the son of a Nun
was full of the spirit of wisdom;
for Moses had b laid his hands upon
him: and the children of Israel
c 
hearkened unto him, and did as
the Lord commanded Moses.
10 ¶ And there arose not a a prophet
since in Israel like unto Moses,
whom the Lord knew b face to face,
11 In all the signs and the wonders, which the Lord sent him to
do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh,
and to all his servants, and to all

and in all the great b terror which
Moses shewed in the sight of all
Israel.

foot shall tread upon, that have I
given unto you, as I said unto Moses.
4 From the wilderness and this

will be b with thee: I will not fail
thee, nor c forsake thee.
6 Be strong and of a good a courage:
for unto this people shalt thou b divide for an c inheritance the d land,
which I sware unto their fathers to
give them.
7 Only be thou strong and very
a 
courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law,
which Moses my servant commanded
thee: b turn not from it to the right
hand or to the left, that thou mayest
c 
prosper whithersoever thou goest.
8 This book of the a law shall not
depart out of thy mouth; but thou
shalt b meditate therein day and
night, that thou mayest observe to
do according to all that is written
therein: for then thou shalt make
thy way prosperous, and then thou
shalt have good success.

days ye shall pass over this Jordan,

Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, The Lord your
God hath given you b rest, and hath
given you this land.
14 Your wives, your little ones,
and your cattle, shall remain in the

your brethren rest, as he hath given
you, and they also have possessed
the land which the Lord your God
giveth them: then ye shall return
unto the land of your possession,
and enjoy it, which Moses the
Lord’s servant gave you on this side
Jordan toward the sunrising.

saying, All that thou commandest
us we will do, and whithersoever
thou sendest us, we will go.

hearken unto thee: only the Lord

Chapter 2
Joshua sends spies to Jericho—They
are received and concealed by Rahab—
They promise to preserve Rahab and
her household.
And Joshua the son of Nun sent out
of Shittim two men to spy secretly,
saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into
an harlot’s house, named a Rahab,
and lodged there.
2 And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men
in hither to night of the children
of Israel to search out the country.
3 And the king of Jericho sent unto
Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men
that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be
come to search out all the country.
4 And the woman took the two
men, and hid them, and said thus,
There came men unto me, but I wist
not whence they were:
5 And it came to pass about the
time of shutting of the gate, when
it was dark, that the men went out:
whither the men went I a wot not:
pursue after them quickly; for ye
shall overtake them.
6 But she had brought them up to
the roof of the house, and hid them
with the stalks of flax, which she
had laid in order upon the roof.
7 And the men pursued after them
the way to Jordan unto the fords:
and as soon as they which pursued
after them were gone out, they shut
the gate.

down, she came up unto them upon
the roof;
9 And she said unto the men, I
know that the Lord hath given
you the land, and that your a terror is fallen upon us, and that all
the inhabitants of the land b faint
because of you.
10 For we have a heard how the
Lord dried up the water of the b Red
sea for you, when ye came out of
Egypt; and what ye did unto the two
kings of the c Amorites, that were on
the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og,
whom ye utterly destroyed.
11 And as soon as we had a heard
these things, our b hearts did melt,
neither did there remain any more
courage in any man, because of you:
for the Lord your God, he is c God in
d 
heaven above, and in earth beneath.
12 Now therefore, I pray you,
a 
swear unto me by the Lord, since
I have shewed you b kindness, that
ye will also shew kindness unto
my father’s house, and give me a
true token:
13 And that ye will save alive my
father, and my mother, and my
brethren, and my sisters, and all
that they have, and deliver our lives
from death.
14 And the men answered her,
Our life for yours, if ye utter not
this our business. And it shall be,
when the Lord hath given us the
land, that we will deal kindly and
truly with thee.
15 Then she let them down by a
a 
cord through the window: for her
house was upon the town wall, and
she dwelt upon the wall.
16 And she said unto them, Get
you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves
there three days, until the pursuers
be returned: and afterward may ye
go your way.

17 And the men said unto her, We
will be a blameless of this thine oath
which thou hast made us swear.
18 Behold, when we come into the
land, thou shalt bind this line of
scarlet thread in the window which
thou didst let us down by: and thou
shalt bring thy a father, and thy
mother, and thy brethren, and all
thy father’s household, home unto
thee.
19 And it shall be, that whosoever
shall go out of the doors of thy house
into the street, his blood shall be upon
his head, and we will be guiltless:
and whosoever shall be with thee
in the house, his blood shall be on
our head, if any hand be upon him.
20 And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine
oath which thou hast made us to
swear.
21 And she said, According unto
your words, so be it. And she sent
them away, and they departed: and
she bound the scarlet line in the
window.
22 And they went, and came unto
the mountain, and abode there
three days, until the pursuers were
returned: and the pursuers sought
them throughout all the way, but
found them not.
23 ¶ So the two men returned, and
descended from the mountain, and
passed over, and came to Joshua the
son of Nun, and told him all things
that befell them:
24 And they said unto Joshua,
Truly the Lord hath a delivered into
our hands all the land; for even all
the inhabitants of the country do
faint because of us.

And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim,
and came to Jordan, he and all the
children of Israel, and lodged there
before they passed over.
2 And it came to pass after three
days, that the officers went through
the host;
3 And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the a ark of
the covenant of the Lord your God,
and the priests the Levites bearing
it, then ye shall remove from your
place, and go after it.
4 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not
near unto it, that ye may know the
a 
way by which ye must go: for ye
have not passed this way heretofore.
5 And Joshua said unto the people, a Sanctify yourselves: for to
morrow the Lord will do wonders
among you.
6 And Joshua spake unto the
priests, saying, Take up the ark of
the covenant, and pass over before
the people. And they took up the
ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
7 ¶ And the Lord said unto Joshua,
This day will I begin to a magnify
thee in the sight of all Israel, that
they may know that, as I was with
Moses, so I will be with thee.
8 And thou shalt command the
priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to
the brink of the water of Jordan, ye
shall stand still in Jordan.
9 ¶ And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear
the words of the Lord your God.

the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and

and the Jebusites.
11 Behold, the ark of the covenant
of the Lord of all the earth passeth
over before you into Jordan.
12 Now therefore take you twelve
men out of the tribes of Israel, out
of every tribe a man.
13 And it shall come to pass, as
soon as the soles of the feet of the
priests that bear the ark of the Lord,
the Lord of all the earth, shall rest
in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from
the waters that come down from
above; and they shall stand upon
an a heap.
14 ¶ And it came to pass, when the
people removed from their tents,
to pass over Jordan, and the priests
bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;
15 And as they that bare the ark
were come unto Jordan, and the feet
of the priests that bare the ark
were dipped in the brim of the
water, (for Jordan overfloweth all
his banks all the time of harvest,)
16 That the a waters which came
down from b above c stood and rose
up upon an d heap very far from
the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the
e 
salt sea, failed, and were cut off:
and the people passed over right
against Jericho.
17 And the priests that bare the
ark of the covenant of the Lord
stood firm on a dry ground in the
midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground,
until all the people were passed
clean over Jordan.

Joshua places twelve stones to commemorate the crossing of the Jordan—
Joshua is magnified before the children
of Israel as they cross the Jordan—After
the priests bearing the ark pass over,
the river returns to its course.
And it came to pass, when all the
people were a clean passed over
Jordan, that the Lord spake unto
Joshua, saying,
2 Take you twelve men out of the
people, out of every tribe a man,
3 And command ye them, saying,
Take you hence out of the midst
of Jordan, out of the place where
the priests’ feet stood firm, a twelve
b 
stones, and ye shall carry them
over with you, and leave them in
the lodging place, where ye shall
lodge this night.
4 Then Joshua called the a twelve
men, whom he had prepared of
the children of Israel, out of every
tribe a man:
5 And Joshua said unto them, Pass
over before the ark of the Lord
your God into the midst of Jordan,
and take ye up every man of you
a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes
of the children of Israel:
6 That this may be a sign among
you, that when your a children ask
their fathers in time to come, saying,
What mean ye by these stones?
7 Then ye shall answer them, That
the waters of Jordan were cut off
before the a ark of the covenant of
the Lord; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut
off: and these stones shall be for a
b 
memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.

Jordan, as the Lord spake unto
Joshua, according to the number of
the tribes of the children of Israel,
and carried them over with them
unto the place where they lodged,
and laid them down there.
9 And Joshua set up twelve stones
in the midst of Jordan, in the place
where the feet of the priests which
bare the ark of the covenant stood:
and they are there unto this day.
10 ¶ For the priests which bare the
ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the
Lord commanded Joshua to speak
unto the people, according to all
that Moses commanded Joshua: and
the people hasted and passed over.
11 And it came to pass, when all
the people were clean a passed over,
that the ark of the Lord passed over,
and the priests, in the presence of
the people.
12 And the children of Reuben,
and the children of Gad, and half
the tribe of Manasseh, passed over
armed before the children of Israel,
as Moses spake unto them:
13 About forty thousand prepared
for war passed over before the Lord
unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.
14 ¶ On that day the Lord a magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they
feared Moses, all the days of his life.
15 And the Lord spake unto
Joshua, saying,
16 Command the priests that bear
the ark of the a testimony, that they
come up out of Jordan.
17 Joshua therefore commanded
the priests, saying, Come ye up out
of Jordan.
18 And it came to pass, when the
priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord were come up
out of the midst of Jordan, and the
soles of the priests’ feet were lifted
up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their

place, and flowed over all his banks,
as they did before.
19 ¶ And the people came up out
of Jordan on the tenth day of the
first month, and encamped in a Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.
20 And those twelve stones, which
they took out of Jordan, did Joshua
pitch in Gilgal.
21 And he spake unto the children
of Israel, saying, When your children
shall ask their fathers in time to come,
saying, What mean these stones?
22 Then ye shall let your a children
b 
know, saying, Israel came over this
Jordan on dry land.
23 For the Lord your God dried
up the waters of Jordan from before
you, until ye were passed over, as
the Lord your God did to the Red
sea, which he a dried up from before
us, until we were gone over:
24 That all the people of the earth
might a know the hand of the Lord,
that it is mighty: that ye might b fear
the Lord your God for ever.
Chapter 5
The inhabitants of Canaan fear Israel—
The males of Israel are circumcised—
Israel keeps the Passover, eats the fruit
of the land, and manna ceases—The
captain of the Lord’s host appears to
Joshua.
And it came to pass, when all the
kings of the Amorites, which were
on the side of Jordan westward,
and all the kings of the Canaanites,
which were by the sea, a heard that
the Lord had dried up the waters
of Jordan from before the children
of Israel, until we were passed over,
that their b heart melted, neither
was there spirit in them any more,
because of the children of Israel.

Joshua, Make thee a sharp knives,
and b circumcise again the children
of Israel the second time.

3 And Joshua made him sharp
knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the
foreskins.
4 And this is the cause why Joshua
did circumcise: All the people that
came out of Egypt, that were males,
even all the men of war, died in the
wilderness by the way, after they
came out of Egypt.
5 Now all the people that came out
were circumcised: but all the people
that were born in the wilderness by
the way as they came forth out of
Egypt, them they had not circumcised.
6 For the children of Israel walked
forty years in the wilderness, till
all the people that were men of war,
which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they a obeyed not the
voice of the Lord: unto whom the
Lord sware that he would not shew
them the b land, which the Lord
c 
sware unto their fathers that he
would give us, a land that floweth
with milk and honey.
7 And their children, whom he
raised up a  in their stead, them
Joshua circumcised: for they were
uncircumcised, because they had
not circumcised them by the way.
8 And it came to pass, when they
had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places
in the camp, till they were a whole.
9 And the Lord said unto Joshua,
This day have I rolled away the
reproach of Egypt from off you.
Wherefore the name of the place is
called a Gilgal unto this day.
10 ¶ And the children of Israel
encamped in Gilgal, and kept the
a 
passover on the fourteenth day of
the month at even in the plains of
Jericho.
11 And they did eat of the a old corn
of the land on the morrow after the

12 ¶ And the a manna ceased on
the morrow after they had eaten
of the old corn of the land; neither
had the children of Israel manna
any more; but they did eat of the
fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
13 ¶ And it came to pass, when
Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted
up his eyes and looked, and, behold,
there stood a a man over against
him with his sword drawn in his
hand: and Joshua went unto him,
and said unto him, Art thou for us,
or for our adversaries?
14 And he said, Nay; but as captain of the a host of the Lord am I
now come. And Joshua fell on his
face to the earth, and did worship,
and said unto him, What saith my
lord unto his servant?
15 And the captain of the Lord’s
host said unto Joshua, Loose thy

whereon thou standest is b holy. And
Joshua did so.

See, I have given into thine hand
Jericho, and the king thereof, and
the mighty men of valour.
3 And ye shall a compass the city,
all ye men of war, and go round
about the city once. Thus shalt thou

and the priests shall blow with the
trumpets.
5 And it shall come to pass, that
when they make a long blast with
the ram’s horn, and when ye hear the
sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout;
and the wall of the city shall fall
down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before
him.
6 ¶ And Joshua the son of Nun
called the priests, and said unto
them, Take up the a ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear
seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the Lord.
7 And he said unto the people,
Pass on, and compass the city, and
let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the Lord.
8 ¶ And it came to pass, when
Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing
the seven trumpets of rams’ horns
passed on before the Lord, and
blew with the trumpets: and the
ark of the covenant of the Lord
followed them.
9 ¶ And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the
trumpets, and a the rearward came
after the ark, the priests going on,
and blowing with the trumpets.
10 And Joshua had commanded the
people, saying, Ye shall not shout,
nor make any noise with your voice,
neither shall any word proceed out
of your mouth, until the day I bid
you shout; then shall ye shout.
11 So the ark of the Lord compassed the city, going about it once:
and they came into the camp, and
lodged in the camp.
12 ¶ And Joshua rose early in the
morning, and the priests took up
the ark of the Lord.
13 And seven priests bearing seven
trumpets of rams’ horns before the
ark of the Lord went on continually,
and blew with the trumpets: and the
	6	a	 tg  Ark of the Covenant.
	9	a	 ie  those bringing up the
rear.
	18	a	 ie  those things under

armed men went before them; but
the rearward came after the ark of
the Lord, the priests going on, and
blowing with the trumpets.
14 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned
into the camp: so they did six days.
15 And it came to pass on the
seventh day, that they rose early
about the dawning of the day, and
compassed the city after the same
manner seven times: only on that
day they compassed the city seven
times.
16 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew
with the trumpets, Joshua said unto
the people, Shout; for the Lord hath
given you the city.
17 ¶ And the city shall be accursed,
even it, and all that are therein, to
the Lord: only Rahab the harlot
shall live, she and all that are with
her in the house, because she hid
the messengers that we sent.
18 And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from a the accursed thing, lest
ye make yourselves accursed, when
ye take of the accursed thing, and
make the camp of Israel a curse,
and trouble it.
19 But all the silver, and gold, and
vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the Lord: they shall
come into the treasury of the Lord.
20 So the people shouted when the
priests blew with the trumpets: and
it came to pass, when the people
heard the sound of the trumpet,
and the people shouted with a great
shout, that the a wall fell down flat,
so that the people went up into the
city, every man straight before him,
and they took the city.
21 And they utterly a destroyed
all that was in the city, both man
and woman, young and old, and ox,
and sheep, and ass, with the edge
of the sword.
22 But Joshua had said unto the
two men that had spied out the

a ban for the people to
take, or dedicated for
a sacrifice to the Lord.

country, Go into the harlot’s house,
and bring out thence the woman,
and all that she hath, as ye sware
unto her.
23 And the young men that were
spies went in, and brought out
a 
Rahab, and her father, and her
mother, and her brethren, and all
that she had; and they brought out
all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.
24 And they burnt the city with
fire, and all that was therein: only
the silver, and the gold, and the
vessels of brass and of iron, they
put into the treasury of the house
of the Lord.
25 And Joshua saved Rahab the
harlot alive, and her father’s household, and all that she had; and she
dwelleth in Israel even unto this
day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out
Jericho.
26 ¶ And Joshua a adjured them
at that time, saying, Cursed be the
man before the Lord, that riseth up
and buildeth this city b Jericho: he
shall lay the foundation thereof in
his firstborn, and in his youngest
son shall he set up the gates of it.
27 So the Lord was a with b Joshua;
and his fame was c noised throughout all the country.
Chapter 7
Israel is defeated by the people of Ai—
Joshua complains to the Lord—Achan
and his household are destroyed because
he disobeyed the Lord by taking the
spoils of Jericho.
But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed
thing: for a Achan, the son of Carmi,
the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah,
of the tribe of Judah, took of the
b 
accursed thing: and the anger of

the Lord was kindled against the
children of Israel.
2 And Joshua sent men from Jericho
to Ai, which is beside a Beth-aven, on
the east side of Beth-el, and spake
unto them, saying, Go up and view
the country. And the men went up
and viewed Ai.
3 And they returned to Joshua,
and said unto him, Let not all the
people go up; but let about two or
three thousand men go up and smite
Ai; and make not all the people to
labour thither; for they are but few.
4 So there went up thither of the
people about three thousand men:
and they a fled before the men of Ai.
5 And the men of Ai smote of them
about thirty and six men: for they
chased them from before the gate
even unto a Shebarim, and smote
them in the b going down: wherefore
the hearts of the people melted, and
became as water.
6 ¶ And Joshua a rent his clothes,
and fell to the earth upon his face
before the ark of the Lord until the
eventide, he and the elders of Israel,
and put dust upon their heads.
7 And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord
God, wherefore hast thou at all
brought this people over Jordan,
to deliver us into the hand of the
Amorites, to destroy us? would to
God we had been content, and dwelt
on the other side Jordan!
8 O Lord, what shall I say, when
Israel turneth their backs before
their enemies!
9 For the Canaanites and all the
inhabitants of the land shall hear
of it, and shall a environ us round,
and cut off our name from the
earth: and what wilt thou do unto
thy great b name?

Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest
thou thus upon thy face?

11 Israel hath a sinned, and they
have also transgressed my covenant
which I commanded them: for they
have even taken of the accursed
thing, and have also stolen, and
b 
dissembled also, and they have
put it even among their own stuff.
12 Therefore the children of Israel
could not stand before their en­
emies, but turned their backs before
their enemies, because they were
accursed: neither will I be with you
any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.
13 Up, a sanctify the people, and
say, b Sanctify yourselves against
to morrow: for thus saith the Lord
God of Israel, There is an accursed
thing in the midst of thee, O Israel:
thou canst not stand before thine
enemies, until ye take away the
accursed thing from among you.
14 In the morning therefore ye
shall be brought according to your
tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe
which the Lord taketh shall come
according to the families thereof;
and the a family which the Lord
shall take shall come by households;
and the household which the Lord
shall take shall come man by man.
15 And it shall be, that he that is
taken with the accursed thing shall
be burnt with fire, he and all that he
hath: because he hath transgressed
the covenant of the Lord, and because he hath a wrought folly in Israel.
16 ¶ So Joshua rose up early in
the morning, and brought Israel by
their tribes; and the tribe of Judah
was taken:
17 And he brought the family of
Judah; and he took the family of
the Zarhites: and he brought the
family of the Zarhites man by man;
and Zabdi was taken:
18 And he brought his household
man by man; and Achan, the son of

19 And Joshua said unto Achan,
My son, give, I pray thee, a glory to
the Lord God of Israel, and make
b 
confession unto him; and c tell me
now what thou hast done; hide it
not from me.
20 And Achan answered Joshua,
and said, Indeed I have sinned
against the Lord a God of Israel, and
thus and thus have I done:
21 When I saw among the spoils
a goodly a Babylonish garment, and
two hundred shekels of silver, and
a wedge of gold of fifty shekels
weight, then I b coveted them, and
took them; and, behold, they are
hid in the earth in the midst of my
tent, and the silver under it.
22 ¶ So Joshua sent messengers,
and they ran unto the tent; and,
behold, it was hid in his tent, and
the silver under it.
23 And they took them out of the
midst of the tent, and brought them
unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out
before the Lord.
24 And Joshua, and all Israel with
him, took Achan the son of Zerah,
and the silver, and the garment, and
the wedge of gold, and his sons, and
his daughters, and his oxen, and his
asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and
all that he had: and they brought
them unto the valley of Achor.
25 And Joshua said, Why hast thou
troubled us? the Lord shall trouble
thee this day. And all Israel stoned
him with stones, and burned them
with fire, after they had stoned
them with stones.
26 And they raised over him a great
heap of stones unto this day. So the
Lord turned from the fierceness
of his anger. Wherefore the name of
that place was called, The valley
of a Achor, unto this day.

Chapter 8
Joshua uses an ambush, takes Ai, and
slays its inhabitants—He builds an altar in Mount Ebal—The words of the
law, both blessings and cursings, are
read to the people.
And the Lord said unto Joshua,
Fear not, neither be thou dismayed:
take all the people of war with thee,
and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have
given into thy hand the king of Ai,
and his people, and his city, and
his land:
2 And thou shalt do to Ai and her
king as thou didst unto a Jericho and
her king: only the spoil thereof, and
the cattle thereof, shall ye take for
a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an
ambush for the city behind it.
3 ¶ So Joshua arose, and all the
people of war, to go up against Ai:
and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and
sent them away by night.
4 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait
against the city, even behind the
city: go not very far from the city,
but be ye all ready:
5 And I, and all the people that
are with me, will approach unto the
city: and it shall come to pass, when
they come out against us, as at the
first, that we will flee before them,
6 (For they will come out after us)
till we have drawn them from the
city; for they will say, They flee
before us, as at the first: therefore
we will flee before them.
7 Then ye shall rise up from the
ambush, and seize upon the city:
for the Lord your God will deliver
it into your hand.
8 And it shall be, when ye have
taken the city, that ye shall set the
city on fire: according to the commandment of the Lord shall ye do.
See, I have commanded you.
9 ¶ Joshua therefore sent them
forth: and they went to lie in ambush,

and abode between Beth-el and Ai,
on the west side of Ai: but Joshua
lodged that night among the people.
10 And Joshua rose up early in the
morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders
of Israel, before the people to Ai.
11 And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went
up, and drew nigh, and came before
the city, and a pitched on the north
side of Ai: now there was a valley
between them and Ai.
12 And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in
ambush between Beth-el and Ai,
on the west side of the city.
13 And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the
north of the city, and a their liers in
wait on the west of the city, Joshua
went that night into the midst of
the valley.
14 ¶ And it came to pass, when the
king of Ai saw it, that they hasted
and rose up early, and the men of
the city went out against Israel to
battle, he and all his people, at a
time appointed, before the plain;
but he a wist not that there were liers
in ambush against him behind the
city.
15 And Joshua and all Israel made
as if they were beaten before them,
and fled by the way of the wilderness.
16 And all the people that were in
Ai were called together to pursue
after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away
from the city.
17 And there was not a man left
in Ai or a Beth-el, that went not out
after Israel: and they left the city
open, and pursued after Israel.
18 And the Lord said unto Joshua,
Stretch out the spear that is in thy
hand toward Ai; for I will give it into
thine hand. And Joshua stretched
out the spear that he had in his hand
toward the city.

19 And the ambush arose quickly
out of their place, and they ran as
soon as he had stretched out his
hand: and they entered into the
city, and took it, and hasted and
set the city on fire.
20 And when the men of Ai looked
behind them, they saw, and, behold,
the smoke of the city ascended up
to heaven, and they had no power
to flee this way or that way: and the
people that fled to the wilderness
turned back upon the pursuers.
21 And when Joshua and all Israel
saw that the ambush had taken the
city, and that the smoke of the city
ascended, then they turned again,
and slew the men of Ai.
22 And the other issued out of the
city against them; so they were in
the midst of Israel, some on this
side, and some on that side: and
they smote them, so that they let
none of them remain or escape.
23 And the king of Ai they took
alive, and brought him to Joshua.
24 And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all
the inhabitants of Ai in the field,
in the wilderness wherein they
chased them, and when they were
all fallen on the edge of the sword,
until they were consumed, that all
the Israelites returned unto Ai, and
smote it with the edge of the sword.
25 And so it was, that all that fell
that day, both of men and women,
were twelve thousand, even all the
men of Ai.
26 For Joshua drew not his hand
back, wherewith he stretched out
the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
27 Only the cattle and the spoil
of that city Israel took for a a prey
unto themselves, according unto
the word of the Lord which he
commanded Joshua.
28 And Joshua burnt Ai, and made
	27	a	 or  spoil, booty.

29 And the king of Ai he hanged
on a tree until eventide: and as
soon as the sun was down, Joshua
commanded that they should take
his carcase down from the tree, and
cast it at the entering of the gate of
the city, and raise thereon a great
heap of stones, that remaineth unto
this day.
30 ¶ Then Joshua built an altar
unto the Lord God of Israel in
mount Ebal,
31 As Moses the servant of the
Lord commanded the children of
Israel, as it is written in the book of
the law of Moses, an a altar of whole
b 
stones, over which no man hath
lift up any c iron: and they offered
thereon burnt offerings unto the
Lord, and sacrificed peace offerings.
32 ¶ And he a wrote there upon the
stones a copy of the law of Moses,
which he wrote in the presence of
the children of Israel.
33 And all Israel, and their elders,
and officers, and their judges, stood
on this side the ark and on that
side before the priests the Levites,
which bare the ark of the covenant
of the Lord, as well the stranger, as
he that was born among them; half
of them over against mount a Geri­
zim, and half of them over against
mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of
the Lord had commanded before,
that they should bless the people
of Israel.
34 And afterward he a read all the
words of the law, the blessings and
b 
cursings, according to all that is
written in the book of the law.
35 There was not a word of all that
Moses commanded, which Joshua
read not before all the a congregation of Israel, with the women, and
the little ones, and the strangers
that b were conversant among them.

Chapter 9
The Gibeonites by craft obtain a league
with Israel—Joshua makes them servants to the congregation of Israel.
And it came to pass, when all the
kings which were on this side Jordan,
in the hills, and in the valleys, and
in all the coasts of the a great sea
over against Lebanon, the Hittite,
and the Amorite, the Canaanite,
the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the
Jebusite, heard thereof;
2 That they gathered themselves
together, to fight with Joshua and
with Israel, with one accord.
3 ¶ And when the inhabitants of
a 
Gibeon heard what b Joshua had
done unto Jericho and to Ai,
4 They did work a wilily, and went
and b made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon
their asses, and wine bottles, old,
and rent, and bound up;
5 And a old shoes and clouted upon
their feet, and old garments upon
them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and b mouldy.
6 And they went to Joshua unto
the camp at Gilgal, and said unto
him, and to the men of Israel, We
be come from a far country: now
therefore make ye a league with us.
7 And the men of Israel said unto
the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell
among us; and how shall we make
a a league with you?
8 And they said unto Joshua, We
are thy servants. And Joshua said
unto them, Who are ye? and from
whence come ye?
9 And they said unto him, From
a very far country thy servants are
come because of the name of the
Lord thy God: for we have a heard
the fame of him, and all that he
did in Egypt,

10 And all that he did to the two
kings of the Amorites, that were
beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of
Heshbon, and to a Og king of Bashan,
which was at Ashtaroth.
11 Wherefore our elders and all
the inhabitants of our country
spake to us, saying, Take a victuals
with you for the journey, and go
to meet them, and say unto them,
We are your servants: therefore now
make ye a league with us.
12 This our bread we took hot for
our provision out of our houses on
the day we came forth to go unto
you; but now, behold, it is dry, and
it is mouldy:
13 And these bottles of wine, which
we filled, were new; and, behold,
they be rent: and these our garments
and our shoes are become old by
reason of the very long journey.
14 And the men took of their victuals, and asked not a counsel at the
mouth of the Lord.
15 And Joshua made peace with
them, and made a league with them,
to let them live: and the princes of
the congregation a sware unto them.
16 ¶ And it came to pass at the end
of three days after they had made a
league with them, that they heard
that they were their neighbours, and
that they dwelt among them.
17 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities
on the third day. Now their cities
were a Gibeon, and Chephirah, and
Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim.
18 And the children of Israel smote
them not, because the princes of
the congregation had sworn unto
them by the Lord God of Israel. And
all the congregation a murmured
against the princes.
19 But all the princes said unto all
the congregation, We have sworn

Israel: now therefore we may not

20 This we will do to them; we
will even let them live, lest wrath
be upon us, because of the oath
which we sware unto them.
21 And the princes said unto them,
Let them live; but let them be a hewers of wood and drawers of water
unto all the congregation; as the
princes had promised them.
22 ¶ And Joshua called for them,
and he spake unto them, saying,
Wherefore have ye a beguiled us,
saying, We are very far from you;
when ye dwell among us?
23 Now therefore ye are cursed,
and there shall none of you be freed
from being bondmen, and hewers
of wood and drawers of water for
the house of my God.
24 And they answered Joshua, and
said, Because it was certainly told
thy servants, how that the Lord thy
God commanded his servant Moses
to give you all the land, and to a destroy all the inhabitants of the land
from before you, therefore we were
sore afraid of our lives because of
you, and have done this thing.
25 And now, behold, we are in thine
hand: as it seemeth good and right
unto thee to do unto us, do.
26 And so did he unto them, and
delivered them out of the hand of
the children of Israel, that they
slew them not.
27 And Joshua made them that
day hewers of wood and drawers
of water for the congregation, and
for the altar of the Lord, even unto
this day, in the a place which he
should choose.
Chapter 10

	22	a	 or  deceived.
Alma 18:23.
	24	a	 Deut. 7:2 (1–4).

Now it came to pass, when a Adonizedek king of Jerusalem had heard
how Joshua had taken Ai, and had
utterly destroyed it; as he had done
to Jericho and her king, so he had
done to Ai and her king; and how
the inhabitants of Gibeon had
made peace with Israel, and were
among them;
2 That they feared greatly, because
a 
Gibeon was a great city, as one of
the royal cities, and because it was
greater than Ai, and all the men
thereof were mighty.
3 Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of
Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king
of Hebron, and unto Piram king of
Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king
of Lachish, and unto Debir king of
Eglon, saying,
4 Come up unto me, and help me,
that we may smite Gibeon: for it
hath made peace with Joshua and
with the children of Israel.
5 Therefore the five kings of the
Amorites, the king of Jerusalem,
the king of Hebron, the king of
Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the
king of Eglon, gathered themselves
together, and went up, they and all
their hosts, and encamped before
Gibeon, and made war against it.
6 ¶ And the men of Gibeon sent
unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
saying, Slack not thy hand from
thy servants; come up to us quickly,
and save us, and help us: for all the
kings of the Amorites that dwell
in the mountains are gathered together against us.
7 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war
with him, and all the mighty men
of valour.
8 ¶ And the Lord said unto Joshua,
Fear them not: for I have a delivered
them into thine hand; there shall
not a man of them stand before thee.
9 Joshua therefore came unto them
suddenly, and went up from Gilgal
all night.

10 And the Lord a  discomfited
them before Israel, and slew them
with a great slaughter at b Gibeon,
and chased them along the way
that goeth up to Beth-horon, and
smote them to Azekah, and unto
Makkedah.
11 And it came to pass, as they fled
from before Israel, and were in the
going down to Beth-horon, that the
Lord cast down great a stones from
heaven upon them unto Azekah,
and they died: they were more which
died with hailstones than they whom
the children of Israel slew with the
sword.
12 ¶ Then spake Joshua to the
Lord in the day when the Lord
delivered up the Amorites before
the children of Israel, and he said
in the sight of Israel, a Sun, stand
thou still upon Gibeon; and thou,
Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.
13 And the a sun stood still, and the
moon stayed, until the people had
avenged themselves upon their en­
emies. Is not this written in the book
of b Jasher? So the sun stood still in
the midst of heaven, and hasted
not to go down about a whole day.
14 And there was no day like that
before it or after it, that the Lord
hearkened unto the voice of a man:
for the Lord a fought for Israel.
15 ¶ And Joshua returned, and
all Israel with him, unto the camp
to Gilgal.
16 But these five kings fled, and
hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.
17 And it was told Joshua, saying,
The five kings are found hid in a
cave at Makkedah.
18 And Joshua said, Roll great
stones upon the mouth of the cave,
and set men by it for to keep them:
19 And stay ye not, but pursue after
your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to

enter into their cities: for the Lord
your God hath delivered them into
your hand.
20 And it came to pass, when
Joshua and the children of Israel
had made an end of slaying them
with a very great slaughter, till
they were consumed, that the rest
which remained of them entered
into fenced cities.
21 And all the people returned to
the camp to Joshua at Makkedah
in peace: none moved his tongue
against any of the children of Israel.
22 Then said Joshua, Open the
mouth of the cave, and bring out
those five kings unto me out of
the cave.
23 And they did so, and brought
forth those five kings unto him out
of the cave, the a king of Jerusalem,
the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the
king of Eglon.
24 And it came to pass, when they
brought out those kings unto Joshua,
that Joshua called for all the men
of Israel, and said unto the captains
of the men of war which went with
him, Come near, put your feet upon
the necks of these kings. And they
came near, and a put their feet upon
the necks of them.
25 And Joshua said unto them, Fear
not, nor be dismayed, be strong and
of good courage: for thus shall the
Lord do to all your enemies against
whom ye fight.
26 And afterward Joshua smote
them, and slew them, and hanged
them on five trees: and they were
hanging upon the trees until the
evening.
27 And it came to pass at the time
of the going down of the sun, that
Joshua commanded, and they took
them down off the trees, and cast
them into the cave wherein they
had been hid, and laid great stones

in the cave’s mouth, which remain
until this very day.
28 ¶ And that day Joshua took
a 
Makkedah, and smote it with the
edge of the sword, and the king
thereof he utterly destroyed, them,
and all the souls that were therein;
he let none remain: and he did to
the king of Makkedah as he did
unto the king of Jericho.
29 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him,
unto Libnah, and fought against
a 
Libnah:
30 And the Lord delivered it also,
and the king thereof, into the hand
of Israel; and he smote it with the
edge of the sword, and all the souls
that were therein; he let none remain
in it; but did unto the king thereof
as he did unto the king of Jericho.
31 ¶ And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto
Lachish, and encamped against it,
and fought against it:
32 And the Lord delivered Lachish
into the hand of Israel, which took
it on the second day, and smote it
with the edge of the sword, and all
the souls that were therein, according
to all that he had done to Libnah.
33 ¶ Then Horam king of a Gezer
came up to help Lachish; and Joshua
smote him and his people, until he
had left him none remaining.
34 ¶ And from Lachish Joshua
passed unto Eglon, and all Israel
with him; and they encamped
against it, and fought against it:
35 And they took it on that day,
and smote it with the edge of the
sword, and all the souls that were
therein he utterly destroyed that
day, according to all that he had
done to Lachish.
36 And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto
Hebron; and they fought against it:

thereof, and all the souls that were

according to all that he had done
to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly,
and all the souls that were therein.
38 ¶ And Joshua returned, and
all Israel with him, to a Debir; and
fought against it:
39 And he took it, and the king
thereof, and all the cities thereof;
and they smote them with the edge
of the sword, and utterly destroyed
all the souls that were therein; he
left none remaining: as he had done
to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and
to the king thereof; as he had done
also to Libnah, and to her king.
40 ¶ So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south,
and of the a vale, and of the springs,
and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly b destroyed all
that breathed, as the Lord God of
Israel commanded.
41 And Joshua smote them from
Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza,
and all the country of Goshen, even
unto Gibeon.
42 And all these kings and their
land did Joshua take at one time,
because the Lord God of Israel
a 
fought for Israel.

Israel with him, unto the camp to
Gilgal.

and on the west, and to the Amorite,
and the Hittite, and the Perizzite,
and the Jebusite in the mountains,
and to the Hivite under Hermon in
the land of Mizpeh.
4 And they went out, they and all
their hosts with them, much people,
even as the sand that is upon the
sea shore in multitude, with horses
and chariots very many.
5 And when all these kings were
met together, they came and pitched
together at the waters of Merom, to
fight against Israel.
6 ¶ And the Lord said unto Joshua,
Be not afraid because of them: for
to morrow about this time will I
a 
deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt b hough their horses,
and burn their chariots with fire.
7 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them
by the waters of Merom suddenly;
and they fell upon them.
8 And the Lord delivered them
into the hand of Israel, who smote
them, and chased them unto great
Zidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim,
and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until
they left them none remaining.
9 And Joshua did unto them as
the Lord bade him: he houghed
their horses, and burnt their chari­
ots with fire.
10 ¶ And Joshua at that time
turned back, and took Hazor, and
smote the king thereof with the
sword: for Hazor beforetime was
the head of all those kingdoms.
11 And they smote all the souls
that were therein with the edge of
the sword, utterly destroying them:
there was not any left to breathe:
and he burnt Hazor with fire.
12 And all the cities of those kings,
and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the
edge of the sword, and he utterly
a 
destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded.
13 But as for the cities that stood

		b	 or  hock, cut the

still in their strength, Israel burned
none of them, save Hazor only; that
did Joshua burn.
14 And all the spoil of these a cities, and the cattle, the children of
Israel took for b a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote
with the edge of the sword, until
they had destroyed them, neither
left they any to breathe.
15 ¶ As the Lord commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he
left nothing undone of all that the
Lord commanded Moses.
16 So Joshua took all that land,
the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and
the valley, and the plain, and the
mountain of Israel, and the valley
of the same;
17 Even from the mount Halak,
that goeth up to Seir, even unto
Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon
under mount Hermon: and all their
kings he took, and smote them, and
slew them.
18 Joshua made war a long time
with all those kings.
19 There was not a city that made
peace with the children of Israel,
save the Hivites the inhabitants of
Gibeon: all other they took in battle.
20 For it was of the a  Lord to
harden their hearts, that they should
come against Israel in battle, that
he might destroy them utterly, and
that they might have no favour, but
that he might destroy them, as the
Lord commanded Moses.
21 ¶ And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from
the mountains, from Hebron, from
Debir, from Anab, and from all the
mountains of Judah, and from all
the mountains of Israel: Joshua
destroyed them utterly with their
cities.
22 There was none of the Anakims
left in the land of the children of
Israel: only in Gaza, in a Gath, and
in Ashdod, there remained.

unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for

And the land rested from war.

Two kings on the east of the Jordan and
thirty-one on the west are conquered
by Israel.
Now these are the kings of the land,
which the children of Israel smote,
and possessed their land on the
other side Jordan toward the rising
of the sun, from the river Arnon
unto mount Hermon, and all the
plain on the east:
2 a Sihon king of the Amorites, who
dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from
Aroer, which is upon the bank of the
river Arnon, and from the middle of
the river, and from half Gilead, even
unto the river Jabbok, which is the
border of the children of Ammon;
3 And from the plain to the sea of
Chinneroth on the east, and unto
the sea of the plain, even the a salt
sea on the east, the way to b Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under c Ashdoth-pisgah:
4 ¶ And the coast of Og king of
Bashan, which was of the remnant
of the a giants, that dwelt at Ashta­
roth and at Edrei,
5 And reigned in mount Hermon,
and in Salcah, and in all Bashan,
unto the border of the Geshurites
and the Maachathites, and half
Gilead, the border of Sihon king
of Heshbon.
6 Them did Moses the servant of
the Lord and the children of Israel
smite: and Moses the servant of the
Lord gave it for a a possession unto
the b Reubenites, and the Gadites,
and the half tribe of Manasseh.

Chapter 13
There remain some lands yet to be
possessed—Some inhabitants are not
expelled—The inheritances of Reuben,
Gad, and one half of Manasseh are
confirmed.
Now a Joshua was old and stricken
in years; and the Lord said unto
him, Thou art old and stricken in
years, and there remaineth yet very
much land to be possessed.
2 This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the Philistines, and all a Geshuri,
3 From Sihor, which is before
Egypt, even unto the borders of
Ekron northward, which is counted
to the Canaanite: a five lords of the
Philistines; the Gazathites, and the
Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the
Gittites, and the Ekronites; also
the Avites:
4 From the south, all the land of
the Canaanites, and Mearah that is
beside the Sidonians, unto Aphek,
to the borders of the Amorites:
5 And the land of the a Giblites, and
all Lebanon, toward the sunrising,
from Baal-gad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath.
6 All the inhabitants of the
hill country from Lebanon unto
Misrephoth-maim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from
before the children of Israel: only
a 
divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have
commanded thee.
7 Now therefore divide this land
for an a inheritance unto the nine
tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
8 With whom the a Reubenites and
the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them,
beyond Jordan eastward, even as

them;

which were b dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.
22 ¶ Balaam also the son of Beor,
the a soothsayer, did the children of
Israel slay with the sword among
them that were slain by them.
23 And the border of the children
of Reuben was Jordan, and the
border thereof. This was the inheri­
tance of the children of Reuben
after their families, the cities and
the villages thereof.
24 And Moses gave inheritance
unto the tribe of Gad, even unto
the children of Gad according to
their families.
25 And their coast was Jazer, and
all the cities of Gilead, and half the
land of the children of Ammon,
unto Aroer that is before Rabbah;
26 And from Heshbon unto Ra­

tribe of the children of Manasseh
by their families.

32 These are the countries which
Moses did distribute for inheritance
in the plains of Moab, on the other
side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward.
33 But unto the tribe of Levi Moses
gave not any a inheritance: the Lord
God of Israel was their inheritance,
as he said unto them.
Chapter 14
The land is divided by lot among 9½
tribes—Caleb inherits Hebron as a special reward for his faithfulness.
And these are the a countries which the
children of Israel inherited in the
land of Canaan, which Eleazar the
priest, and Joshua the son of b Nun,
and the heads of the fathers of the
tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.
2 By a lot was their inheritance, as
the Lord commanded by the hand
of Moses, for the nine tribes, and
for the half tribe.
3 For Moses had given the inheri­
tance of two a tribes and an half
tribe on the other side Jordan: but
unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.
4 For the children of a Joseph were
two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:
therefore they gave no part unto
the Levites in the land, save cities
to dwell in, with their b suburbs for
their cattle and for their substance.
5 As the Lord commanded Moses,
so the children of Israel did, and
they divided the land.
6 ¶ Then the children of Judah
came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and
Caleb the son of Jephunneh the
Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto
Moses the man of God concerning
me and thee in Kadesh-barnea.

7 Forty years old was I when Moses

from Kadesh-barnea to espy out
the land; and I brought him word
again as it was in mine heart.
8 Nevertheless my a brethren that
went up with me made the heart of
the people melt: but I wholly b followed the Lord my God.
9 And Moses sware on that day,
saying, Surely the a land whereon
thy feet have trodden shall be thine
inheritance, and thy children’s for
ever, because thou hast wholly followed the Lord my God.
10 And now, behold, the Lord hath
kept me alive, a as he said, these
forty and five years, even since the
Lord spake this word unto Moses,
while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now,
lo, I am this day fourscore and five
years old.
11 As yet I am as strong this day
as I was in the day that Moses sent
me: as my strength was then, even
so is my strength now, for war, both
to go out, and to come in.
12 Now therefore give me this
mountain, whereof the Lord spake
in that day; for thou heardest in
that day how the Anakims were
there, and that the cities were great
and a fenced: if so be the Lord will
be with me, then I shall be able
to drive them out, as the Lord
said.
13 And Joshua blessed him, and
gave unto Caleb the son of Jephun­
neh Hebron for an inheritance.
14 Hebron therefore became the
inheritance of a Caleb the son of Je­
phunneh the Kenezite unto this day,
because that he wholly followed the
Lord God of Israel.

was Kirjath-arba; which a Arba was a

Judah is given an inheritance in Canaan—The Jebusites dwell with Judah
at Jerusalem.
This then was the lot of the tribe
of the children of Judah by their
families; even to the border of Edom
the wilderness of a Zin southward
was the uttermost part of the south
coast.
2 And their south border was from
the shore of the a salt sea, from the
bay that b looketh southward:
3 And it went out to the south side
to Maaleh-acrabbim, and passed
along to Zin, and ascended up on
the south side unto Kadesh-barnea,
and passed along to Hezron, and
went up to Adar, and a fetched a
compass to Karkaa:
4 From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river
of Egypt; and the goings out of that
a 
coast were at the sea: this shall be
your south coast.
5 And the east border was the salt
sea, even unto the end of Jordan. And
their border in the north quarter
was from the bay of the sea at the
uttermost part of Jordan:
6 And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the north
of Beth-arabah; and the border went
up to the a stone of Bohan the son
of Reuben:
7 And the border went up toward
Debir from the valley of Achor, and
so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to
Adummim, which is on the south
side of the river: and the border
passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof
were at En-rogel:
8 And the border went up by the
valley of the son of Hinnom unto the
south side of the a Jebusite; the same
is Jerusalem: and the border went

lieth before the valley of Hinnom
westward, which is at the end of
the valley of the giants northward:
9 And the border was a  drawn
from the top of the hill unto the
fountain of the water of Nephtoah,
and went out to the cities of mount
Ephron; and the border was drawn
to Baalah, which is Kirjath-jearim:
10 And the border a compassed
from Baalah westward unto mount
Seir, and passed along unto the side
of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon,
on the north side, and went down
to Beth-shemesh, and passed on to
Timnah:
11 And the border went out unto
the side of Ekron northward: and
the border was drawn to Shicron,
and passed along to mount Baalah,
and went out unto Jabneel; and
the goings out of the border were
at the sea.
12 And the a west border was to
b 
the great sea, and the coast thereof.
This is the coast of the children of
Judah round about according to
their families.
13 ¶ And unto a Caleb the son of
Jephunneh he gave a part among
the children of Judah, according
to the commandment of the Lord
to Joshua, even the city of Arba the
father of Anak, which city is Hebron.
14 And Caleb drove thence the
three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and
Ahiman, and Talmai, the children
of Anak.
15 And he went up thence to the
inhabitants of Debir: and the name
of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher.
16 ¶ And Caleb said, He that
smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh
it, to him will I give Achsah my
daughter to wife.
17 And Othniel the son of Kenaz,
the brother of a Caleb, took it: and

Chapter 16
The children of Joseph (Ephraim and
Manasseh) receive their inheritances—
Some Canaanites continue to dwell
among the Ephraimites.
And the lot of the children of  a Joseph
fell from Jordan by Jericho, unto
the water of Jericho on the east, to
the wilderness that goeth up from
Jericho throughout mount Beth-el,
2 And goeth out from a Beth-el to
Luz, and passeth along unto the
borders of Archi to Ataroth,
3 And goeth down westward to the
a 
coast of Japhleti, unto the coast
of Beth-horon the b nether, and to
Gezer: and the goings out thereof
are at the sea.
4 So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their
a 
inheritance.
5 ¶ And the border of the children
of Ephraim according to their fami­
lies was thus: even the border of
their inheritance on the east side
was Ataroth-addar, unto Beth-horon
the upper;
6 And the border went out toward
the sea to Michmethah on the north
side; and the border went about
eastward unto Taanath-shiloh, and
passed by it on the east to Janohah;
7 And it went down from Janohah
to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and
came to Jericho, and went out at
Jordan.

and the goings out thereof were at
the sea. This is the inheritance of
the tribe of the children of Ephraim
by their families.
9 And the separate cities for the
children of Ephraim were among
the inheritance of the children of
Manasseh, all the cities with their
villages.
10 And they drave not out the
a 
Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer:
but the Canaanites dwell among
the Ephraimites unto this day, and
serve b under tribute.
Chapter 17
Manasseh and Ephraim both receive
an additional inheritance—Ephraim
is to drive out the Canaanites from the
hill country.
There was also a lot for the tribe of
a 
Manasseh; for he was the firstborn
of Joseph; to wit, for b Machir the
firstborn of Manasseh, the father of
Gilead: because he was a man of war,
therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.
2 There was also a lot for the rest of
the children of a Manasseh by their
families; for the children of Abiezer,
and for the children of Helek, and
for the children of Asriel, and for
the children of Shechem, and for
the children of Hepher, and for the
children of Shemida: these were the
male children of Manasseh the son
of Joseph by their families.
3 ¶ But Zelophehad, the son of
Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son
of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had
no sons, but daughters: and these
are the names of his daughters,
Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah,
and Tirzah.
4 And they came near before a Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the
son of Nun, and before the princes,
saying, The Lord commanded Moses to give us an b inheritance among
our brethren. Therefore according
to the commandment of the Lord

he gave them an inheritance among
the brethren of their father.
5 And there fell ten portions to
Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the
other side Jordan;
6 Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among
his sons: and the rest of Manasseh’s
sons had the land of Gilead.
7 ¶ And the a coast of Manasseh
was from Asher to Michmethah,
that lieth before Shechem; and the
border went along on the right hand
unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
8 Now Manasseh had the land
of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the
border of Manasseh belonged to the
children of Ephraim;
9 And the coast descended unto
the river Kanah, southward of the
river: these cities of Ephraim are
among the cities of Manasseh: the
coast of Manasseh also was on the
north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea:
10 Southward it was Ephraim’s,
and northward it was Manasseh’s,
and the sea is his border; and they
met together in Asher on the north,
and in Issachar on the east.
11 And Manasseh had in Issachar
and in Asher Beth-shean and her
towns, and Ibleam and her towns,
and the inhabitants of Dor and her
towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor
and her towns, and the inhabitants
of Taanach and her towns, and the
inhabitants of Megiddo and her
towns, even three countries.
12 Yet the children of Manasseh
could not drive out the inhabitants
of those cities; but the Canaanites
would dwell in that land.
13 Yet it came to pass, when the
children of Israel were waxen
strong, that they put the Canaanites to a tribute; but did not utterly
drive them out.
14 And the children of Joseph
spake unto Joshua, saying, Why

hast thou given me but one lot and
one portion to inherit, seeing I am
a a great people, forasmuch as the
Lord hath blessed me hitherto?
15 And Joshua answered them,
If thou be a great people, then get
thee up to the wood country, and
a 
cut down for thyself there in the
land of the Perizzites and of the
b 
giants, if mount Ephraim be too
narrow for thee.
16 And the children of Joseph said,
The hill is not enough for us: and
all the Canaanites that dwell in the
land of the valley have a chariots of
iron, both they who are of Beth-shean
and her towns, and they who are of
the valley of Jezreel.
17 And Joshua spake unto the house
of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to
Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great
people, and hast great power: thou
shalt not have one lot only:
18 But the mountain shall be thine;
for it is a a wood, and thou shalt cut
it down: and the outgoings of it shall
be thine: for thou shalt drive out the
Canaanites, though they have iron
b 
chariots, and though they be strong.
Chapter 18
The tabernacle of the congregation is
set up at Shiloh—Benjamin receives an
inheritance by lot.
And the whole congregation of the
children of Israel assembled together
at a Shiloh, and set up the b tabernacle of the congregation there. And
the land was subdued before them.
2 And there remained among
the children of Israel seven tribes,
which had not yet received their
inheritance.
3 And Joshua said unto the children
of Israel, How long are ye slack to go
to possess the land, which the Lord
God of your fathers hath given you?

them, and they shall rise, and go
through the land, and describe
it according to the inheritance of
them; and they shall come again
to me.
5 And they shall divide it into
seven parts: Judah shall abide in
their a coast on the south, and the
house of Joseph shall abide in their
coasts on the north.
6 Ye shall therefore describe the
land into seven parts, and bring the
description hither to me, that I may
cast a lots for you here before the
Lord our God.
7 But the a Levites have no part
among you; for the priesthood of
the Lord is their b inheritance: and
Gad, and c Reuben, and half the tribe
of Manasseh, have received their
inheritance beyond Jordan on the
east, which Moses the servant of
the Lord gave them.
8 ¶ And the men arose, and went
away: and Joshua charged them that
went to describe the land, saying,
Go and walk through the land, and
describe it, and come again to me,
that I may here cast lots for you
before the Lord in Shiloh.
9 And the men went and passed
through the land, and described it
by cities into seven parts in a book,
and came again to Joshua to the
host at Shiloh.
10 ¶ And Joshua cast lots for them
in Shiloh before the Lord: and there
Joshua divided the land unto the
children of Israel according to their
divisions.
11 ¶ And the lot of the tribe of the
children of a Benjamin came up according to their families: and the
coast of their lot came forth between
the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.

12 And their border on the north
side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho
on the north side, and went up
through the mountains westward;
and the goings out thereof were at
the wilderness of a Beth-aven.
13 And the border went over from
thence toward Luz, to the side
of a Luz, which is Beth-el, southward; and the border descended to
Ataroth-adar, near the hill that
lieth on the south side of the b nether
Beth-horon.
14 And the border was drawn
thence, and a compassed the corner
of the sea southward, from the hill
that lieth before Beth-horon southward; and the goings out thereof
were at Kirjath-baal, which is
Kirjath-jearim, a city of the children of Judah: this was the west
quarter.
15 And the south quarter was from
the end of Kirjath-jearim, and the
border went out on the west, and
went out to the well of waters of
Nephtoah:
16 And the border came down to
the end of the mountain that lieth before the valley of the son of
a 
Hinnom, and which is in the valley
of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of b Hinnom,
to the side of Jebusi on the south,
and descended to En-rogel,
17 And was drawn from the north,
and went forth to En-shemesh, and
went forth toward Geliloth, which is
over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the a stone
of Bohan the son of Reuben,
18 And passed along toward the
side over against Arabah northward,
and went down unto Arabah:
19 And the border passed along to
the side of Beth-hoglah northward:
and the outgoings of the border
were at the north bay of a the salt
sea at the south end of Jordan: this
was the south coast.

on the east side. This was the inheri­

by the coasts thereof round about,
according to their families.
21 Now the cities of the tribe of
the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho,
and Beth-hoglah, and the valley of
Keziz,
22 And Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Beth-el,
23 And Avim, and Parah, and

Simeon, Zebulun, Issachar, Asher,
Naphtali, and Dan receive their inheri­
tances by lot.
And the second lot came forth to
Simeon, even for the tribe of the
children of Simeon according to
their families: and their inheritance
was within the inheritance of the
children of Judah.
2 And they had in their inheritance
Beer-sheba, or Sheba, and Moladah,
3 And Hazar-shual, and Balah,
and Azem,
4 And Eltolad, and Bethul, and

8 And all the villages that were
round about these cities to Baalathbeer, Ramath of the south. This is
the inheritance of the tribe of the
children of Simeon according to
their families.
9 Out of the portion of the children
of Judah was the inheritance of the
children of Simeon: for the part of
the children of Judah was too much
for them: therefore the children of
Simeon had their inheritance within
the inheritance of them.
10 ¶ And the third lot came up for
the children of a Zebulun according
to their families: and the border of
their inheritance was unto Sarid:
11 And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and
reached to Dabbasheth, and reached
to the river that is before Jokneam;
12 And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the
border of Chisloth-tabor, and then
goeth out to Daberath, and goeth
up to Japhia,
13 And from thence passeth on
along on the east to Gittah-hepher,
to Ittah-kazin, and goeth out to
Remmon-methoar to Neah;
14 And the border compasseth it
on the north side to Hannathon:
and the outgoings thereof are in
the valley of Jiphthah-el:
15 And Kattath, and Nahallal, and
Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their
villages.
16 This is the inheritance of the
children of Zebulun according to
their families, these cities with
their villages.
17 ¶ And the fourth lot came out
to Issachar, for the children of Issachar according to their families.
18 And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and a Shunem,
19 And Hapharaim, and Shion,
and Anaharath,

and Abez,

border were at Jordan: sixteen cities
with their villages.
23 This is the inheritance of the
tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities
and their villages.
24 ¶ And the fifth lot came out for
the tribe of the children of Asher
according to their families.
25 And their border was Helkath,
and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,
26 And Alammelech, and Amad,
and Misheal; and reacheth to Carmel
westward, and to Shihor-libnath;
27 And turneth toward the sunrising to Beth-dagon, and reacheth
to Zebulun, and to the valley of
Jiphthah-el toward the north side
of Beth-emek, and Neiel, and goeth
out to Cabul on the left hand,
28 And Hebron, and Rehob, and
Hammon, and Kanah, even unto
great Zidon;
29 And then the coast turneth to
Ramah, and to the strong city Tyre;
and the coast turneth to Hosah; and
the outgoings thereof are at the sea
from the coast to Achzib:
30 Ummah also, and Aphek, and
Rehob: twenty and two cities with
their villages.
31 This is the inheritance of the
tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.
32 ¶ The sixth lot came out to
the children of Naphtali, even for
the children of Naphtali according
to their families.
33 And their coast was from
Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim,
and Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel,
unto Lakum; and the outgoings
thereof were at Jordan:

side, and reacheth to Asher on the
west side, and to Judah upon Jordan toward the sunrising.
35 And the a fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath,
and Chinnereth,
36 And Adamah, and Ramah, and
Hazor,
37 And Kedesh, and Edrei, and
En-hazor,
38 And Iron, and Migdal-el,
Horem, and Beth-anath, and Bethshemesh; nineteen cities with their
villages.
39 This is the inheritance of the
tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities
and their villages.
40 ¶ And the seventh lot came out
for the tribe of the children of Dan
according to their families.
41 And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and
Ir-shemesh,
42 And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon,
and Jethlah,
43 And Elon, and Thimnathah,
and Ekron,
44 And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon,
and Baalath,
45 And Jehud, and Bene-berak,
and Gath-rimmon,
46 And Me-jarkon, and Rakkon,
with the border before Japho.
47 And the coast of the children
of Dan went out too little for them:
therefore the children of Dan went
up to fight against Leshem, and
took it, and smote it with the edge
of the sword, and possessed it, and
dwelt therein, and called Leshem,
Dan, after the name of Dan their
father.
48 This is the inheritance of the
tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities
with their villages.

gave an inheritance to Joshua the
son of Nun among them:
50 According to the word of the
Lord they gave him the city which
he asked, even Timnath-serah in
mount a Ephraim: and he built the
city, and dwelt therein.
51 These are the a inheritances,
which Eleazar the priest, and b Joshua
the son of Nun, and the heads of the
fathers of the tribes of the children
of Israel, divided for an inheritance
by lot in Shiloh before the Lord,
at the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation. So they made an end
of dividing the country.
Chapter 20
Six cities of refuge are appointed for
those guilty of manslaughter.
The Lord also spake unto Joshua,
saying,
2 Speak to the children of Israel,
saying, Appoint out for you cities
of a refuge, whereof I spake unto
you by the hand of Moses:
3 That the a slayer that killeth any
person b unawares and unwittingly
may flee thither: and they shall
be your refuge from the avenger
of blood.
4 And when he that doth flee unto
one of those cities shall stand at the
entering of the a gate of the city, and
shall declare his cause in the ears
of the b elders of that city, they shall
take him into the city unto them,
and give him a place, that he may
dwell among them.
5 And if the a avenger of blood
pursue after him, then they shall
not deliver the slayer up into his
hand; because he smote his neighbour unwittingly, and hated him
not beforetime.
6 And he shall dwell in that city,
until he stand before the congregation for judgment, and until the
death of the a high priest that shall be

and unto his own house, unto the
city from whence he fled.
7 ¶ And they appointed Kedesh
in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and
Shechem in mount Ephraim, and
Kirjath-arba, which is Hebron, in
the mountain of Judah.
8 And on the other side Jordan
by Jericho eastward, they assigned
Bezer in the wilderness upon the
plain out of the tribe of Reuben,
and Ramoth in a Gilead out of the
tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan
out of the tribe of Manasseh.
9 These were the cities appointed
for all the children of Israel, and
for the a stranger that b sojourneth
among them, that whosoever killeth
any person at unawares might flee
thither, and not die by the hand of
the avenger of blood, until he stood
before the congregation.
Chapter 21
The Levites receive forty-eight cities
with their suburbs—The Lord fulfills
all His promises and gives Israel rest.
Then came near the heads of the
fathers of the a Levites unto Eleazar
the priest, and unto Joshua the son
of Nun, and unto the heads of the
fathers of the tribes of the children
of Israel;
2 And they spake unto them at
Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The Lord commanded by the
hand of Moses to give us cities to
dwell in, with the suburbs thereof
for our cattle.
3 And the children of Israel gave
unto the Levites out of their inheri­
tance, at the commandment of the
Lord, these cities and their suburbs.
4 And the lot came out for the
families of the a Kohathites: and the
children of Aaron the priest, which
were of the Levites, had by lot out
of the tribe of Judah, and out of the

of Benjamin, thirteen cities.
5 And the rest of the children of
Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out
of the tribe of Dan, and out of the
half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.
6 And the children of Gershon had
by lot out of the families of the tribe
of Issachar, and out of the tribe of
Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.
7 The children of Merari by their
families had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad,
and out of the tribe of Zebulun,
twelve cities.
8 And the children of Israel gave
by lot unto the Levites these cities
with their suburbs, as the Lord
commanded by the hand of Moses.
9 ¶ And they gave out of the tribe
of the children of Judah, and out of
the tribe of the children of Simeon,
these a cities which are here mentioned by name,
10 Which the children of Aaron,
being of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi,
had: for theirs was the first lot.
11 And they gave them the city
of a Arba the father of Anak, which
city is Hebron, in the hill country of
Judah, with the suburbs thereof
round about it.
12 But the fields of the city, and
the villages thereof, gave they to
a 
Caleb the son of Jephunneh for
his possession.
13 ¶ Thus they gave to the children of a Aaron the priest Hebron
with her suburbs, to be a city of
refuge for the slayer; and Libnah
with her suburbs,
14 And Jattir with her suburbs,
and Eshtemoa with her suburbs,
15 And Holon with her suburbs,

18 a Anathoth with her suburbs,
and Almon with her suburbs; four

19 All the cities of the children
of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen
cities with their suburbs.
20 ¶ And the families of the children of a Kohath, the Levites which
remained of the children of Kohath,
even they had the cities of their lot
out of the tribe of Ephraim.
21 For they gave them Shechem
with her suburbs in mount Ephraim,
to be a city of refuge for the slayer;
and Gezer with her suburbs,
22 And Kibzaim with her suburbs,
and Beth-horon with her suburbs;
four cities.
23 And out of the tribe of Dan,
Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon with her suburbs,

25 And out of the half tribe of
Manasseh, Tanach with her suburbs, and Gath-rimmon with her
suburbs; two cities.
26 All the cities were ten with their
suburbs for the families of the children of Kohath that remained.
27 ¶ And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites,
out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan
with her suburbs, to be a city of
refuge for the slayer; and Beeshterah with her suburbs; two cities.
28 And out of the tribe of Issachar,
Kishon with her suburbs, Dabareh
with her suburbs,

32 And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her
suburbs, to be a city of refuge for

her suburbs, and Kartan with her
suburbs; three cities.
33 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were
thirteen cities with their suburbs.
34 ¶ And unto the families of the
children of a Merari, the rest of the
Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun,
Jokneam with her suburbs, and
Kartah with her suburbs,
35 Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four cities.
36 And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and
Jahazah with her suburbs,
37 Kedemoth with her suburbs,
and Mephaath with her suburbs;
four cities.
38 And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in a Gilead with her suburbs,
to be a city of refuge for the slayer;
and Mahanaim with her suburbs,
39 Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer
with her suburbs; four cities in all.
40 So all the cities for the children
of Merari by their families, which
were remaining of the families of
the Levites, were by their lot twelve
cities.
41 All the cities of the a Levites
within the b possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight
cities with their suburbs.
42 These cities were every one with
their suburbs round about them:
thus were all these cities.
43 ¶ And the Lord gave unto Israel all the a land which he b sware
to give unto their fathers; and they
possessed it, and dwelt therein.
44 And the Lord gave them a rest
round about, according to all that

Chapter 22
The 2½ tribes are dismissed with a
blessing—They build an altar of testimony by the Jordan to show they are
the Lord’s people—It is not an altar for
sacrifices or burnt offerings.
Then Joshua called the a Reubenites,
and the Gadites, and the half tribe
of Manasseh,
2 And said unto them, Ye have
kept all that Moses the servant of
the Lord commanded you, and
have obeyed my voice in all that I
commanded you:
3 Ye have not left your brethren
these many days unto this day, but
have kept the charge of the commandment of the Lord your God.
4 And now the Lord your God hath
given a rest unto your brethren, as
he promised them: therefore now
return ye, and get you unto your
tents, and unto the b land of your
possession, which Moses the servant
of the Lord gave you on the other
side Jordan.
5 But take a diligent heed to do
the b commandment and the law,
which Moses the servant of the Lord
charged you, to c love the Lord your
God, and to d walk in all his ways,
and to keep his commandments, and
to cleave unto him, and to e serve
him with all your f heart and with
all your soul.
6 So Joshua blessed them, and sent
them away: and they went unto
their tents.

tribe of Manasseh Moses had given

possession in Bashan: but unto the
other half thereof gave Joshua among
their brethren on this side Jordan
westward. And when Joshua sent
them away also unto their tents,
then he blessed them,
8 And he spake unto them, saying,
Return with much riches unto your
tents, and with very much cattle,
with silver, and with gold, and with
brass, and with iron, and with very
much raiment: divide the spoil of
your enemies with your brethren.
9 ¶ And the children of Reuben
and the children of Gad and the
half tribe of Manasseh returned,
and departed from the children of
Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the
land of Canaan, to go unto the country of a Gilead, to the land of their
possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the
Lord by the hand of Moses.
10 ¶ And when they came unto
the borders of Jordan, that are in
the land of Canaan, the children
of Reuben and the children of Gad
and the half tribe of Manasseh built
there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to.
11 ¶ And the children of Israel
heard say, Behold, the children of
Reuben and the children of Gad and
the half tribe of Manasseh have built
an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at
the passage of the children of Israel.
12 And when the children of Israel
heard of it, the whole congregation
of the children of Israel gathered
themselves together at Shiloh, to go
up to war against them.
13 And the children of Israel sent
unto the children of Reuben, and to
the children of Gad, and to the half
tribe of Manasseh, into the land of
Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar
the priest,
14 And with him ten princes, of

each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each
one was an head of the house of
their fathers among the thousands
of Israel.
15 ¶ And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children
of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead,
and they spake with them, saying,
16 Thus saith the whole a congregation of the Lord, What trespass
is this that ye have committed
against the God of Israel, to turn
away this day from following the
Lord, in that ye have builded you
an altar, that ye might b rebel this
day against the Lord?
17 Is the a iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not
cleansed until this day, although
there was a plague in the congregation of the Lord,
18 But that ye must turn away this
day from following the Lord? and
it will be, seeing ye a rebel to day
against the Lord, that to morrow
he will be wroth with the whole
congregation of Israel.
19 Notwithstanding, if the land
of your possession be unclean, then
pass ye over unto the land of the
possession of the Lord, wherein the
Lord’s tabernacle dwelleth, and take
possession among us: but rebel not
against the Lord, nor rebel against
us, in building you an altar beside
the altar of the Lord our God.
20 Did not a Achan the son of
Zerah commit a trespass in the
accursed thing, and wrath fell on
all the congregation of Israel? and
that man perished not alone in his
iniquity.
21 ¶ Then the children of Reuben
and the children of Gad and the
half tribe of Manasseh answered,
and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,
22 The Lord a God of gods, the
Lord God of gods, he knoweth, and
Israel he shall know; if it be in rebel	16	a	 tg  Church.

lion, or if in transgression against
the Lord, (save us not this day,)
23 That we have built us an altar
to turn from following the Lord,
or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer
peace offerings thereon, let the
Lord himself require it;
24 And if we have not rather done
it for fear of this thing, saying, In
time to come your children might
speak unto our children, saying,
What have ye to do with the Lord
God of Israel?
25 For the Lord hath made Jordan
a border between us and you, ye
children of Reuben and children of
Gad; ye have no part in the Lord: so
shall your children make our children cease from fearing the Lord.
26 Therefore we said, Let us now
prepare to build us an altar, not for
burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:
27 But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do
the service of the Lord before him
with our burnt offerings, and with
our sacrifices, and with our peace
offerings; that your children may
not say to our children in time to
come, Ye have no part in the Lord.
28 Therefore said we, that it shall
be, when they should so say to us
or to our generations in time to
come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the
Lord, which our fathers made, not
for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between
us and you.
29 God forbid that we should rebel
against the Lord, and turn this day
from following the Lord, to build an
altar for burnt offerings, for meat
offerings, or for sacrifices, beside
the altar of the Lord our God that
is before his tabernacle.

the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and
the children of Manasseh spake, it
pleased them.
31 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar
the priest said unto the children of
Reuben, and to the children of Gad,
and to the children of Manasseh,
This day we perceive that the Lord
is a among us, because ye have not
committed this trespass against the
Lord: now ye have delivered the
children of Israel out of the hand
of the Lord.
32 ¶ And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben,
and from the children of Gad, out
of the land of Gilead, unto the land
of Canaan, to the children of Israel,
and brought them word again.
33 And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of
Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the
children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.
34 And the children of Reuben and
the children of Gad called the altar

us that the Lord is a God.

I am old and stricken in age:
3 And ye have seen all that the
Lord your God hath done unto all
these nations because of you; for
the Lord your God is he that hath
fought for you.
4 Behold, I have divided unto you
by lot these nations that remain, to
be an inheritance for your tribes,
from Jordan, with all the nations
that I have cut off, even unto the
a

5 And the Lord your God, he shall
a 
expel them from before you, and
drive them from out of your sight;
and ye shall possess their land, as
the Lord your God hath promised
unto you.
6 Be ye therefore very a courageous
to keep and to do all that is written
in the book of the law of Moses, that
ye turn not aside therefrom to the
right hand or to the left;
7 That ye come not among these
nations, these that remain among
you; neither make mention of the
name of their a gods, nor cause to
swear by them, neither serve them,
nor bow yourselves unto them:

that as all good things are come

And Joshua gathered all the tribes
of Israel to Shechem, and called for
the elders of Israel, and for their
heads, and for their judges, and for

themselves before God.
2 And Joshua said unto all the
people, Thus saith the Lord God
of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the
other side of the flood in old time,
even Terah, the father of Abraham,
and the father of Nachor: and they
served other a gods.
3 And I took your father Abraham
from the other side of the flood, and
led him throughout all the land of
Canaan, and multiplied his a seed,
and gave him Isaac.
4 And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and
Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount
Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and
his children went down into Egypt.
5 I sent Moses also and Aaron, and
I a plagued Egypt, according to that
which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.
6 And I a brought your fathers out
of Egypt: and ye came unto the
sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and
horsemen unto the b Red sea.
7 And when they cried unto the
Lord, he put a darkness between you
and the Egyptians, and brought the
sea upon them, and covered them;
and your eyes have seen what I have
done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the
wilderness a long season.
8 And I brought you into the land
of the a Amorites, which dwelt on the
other side Jordan; and they fought
with you: and I gave them into your
hand, that ye might possess their
land; and I b destroyed them from

king of Moab, arose and warred
against Israel, and sent and called
Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:
10 But I would not hearken unto
Balaam; therefore he blessed you
still: so I delivered you out of his
hand.
11 And ye went over Jordan, and
came unto a Jericho: and the men
of Jericho fought against you, the
Amorites, and the Perizzites, and
the Canaanites, and the Hittites,
and the Girgashites, the Hivites,
and the Jebusites; and I delivered
them into your hand.
12 And I sent the a hornet before
you, which drave them out from before you, even the two kings of the
Amorites; but not with thy b sword,
nor with thy bow.
13 And I have a given you a land
for which ye did not labour, and
cities which ye built not, and ye
dwell in them; of the vineyards
and oliveyards which ye planted
not do ye eat.
14 ¶ Now therefore a fear the Lord,
and serve him in b sincerity and in

your fathers served on the other

serve ye the Lord.
15 And if it seem evil unto you to

day whom ye will c serve; whether

that were on the other side of the
flood, or the gods of the Amorites,
in whose land ye dwell: but as for

said, God forbid that we should forsake the Lord, to serve other gods;

that brought us up and our fathers
out of the land of Egypt, from the
house of bondage, and which did
those great signs in our sight, and
preserved us in all the way wherein
we went, and among all the people
through whom we passed:
18 And the Lord drave out from
before us all the people, even the
Amorites which dwelt in the land:
therefore will we also serve the Lord;
for he is our God.
19 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the Lord: for
he is an a holy God; he is a b jealous
God; he will not c forgive your transgressions nor your sins.
20 If ye forsake the Lord, and serve
strange a gods, then he will turn and
do you b hurt, and consume you,
after that he hath done you good.
21 And the people said unto Joshua,
Nay; but we will a serve the Lord.
22 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the
Lord, to a serve him. And they said,
We are witnesses.
23 Now therefore put away, said he,
the strange a gods which are among
you, and incline your heart unto
the Lord God of Israel.
24 And the people said unto Joshua, The Lord our God will we serve,
and his voice will we obey.
25 So Joshua made a covenant
with the people that day, and set
them a statute and an ordinance
in Shechem.
26 ¶ And Joshua wrote these words
in the book of the law of God, and
took a great a stone, and set it up
there under an oak, that was by the

28 So Joshua let the people depart,
every man unto his inheritance.
29 ¶ And it came to pass after these
things, that Joshua the son of Nun,
the servant of the Lord, died, being
an hundred and ten years old.
30 And they a buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim,
on the north side of the hill of

31 And Israel a served the Lord
all the days of Joshua, and all the

days of the elders that overlived
Joshua, and which had known all

done for Israel.
32 ¶ And the a bones of Joseph,
which the children of Israel brought
up out of Egypt, buried they in
Shechem, in a parcel of ground
which Jacob bought of the sons of
Hamor the father of Shechem for
an hundred pieces of silver: and it
became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.

fight against them?
2 And the Lord said, Judah shall
go up: behold, I have delivered the
land into his hand.

Lord delivered the Canaanites and
the Perizzites into their hand: and
they slew of them in Bezek a ten

8 Now the children of Judah had
fought against Jerusalem, and had
taken it, and smitten it with the
edge of the sword, and set the city
on fire.
9 ¶ And afterward the children of
Judah went down to fight against
the Canaanites, that dwelt in the
mountain, and in the south, and
in the valley.
10 And Judah went against the
Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron:
(now the name of Hebron before
was Kirjath-arba:) and they slew
Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
11 And from thence he went
against the inhabitants of Debir:
and the name of Debir before was

him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
13 And Othniel the son of Kenaz,
Caleb’s younger brother, took it: and
he gave him Achsah his daughter
to wife.
14 And it came to pass, when she
came to him, that she moved him
to ask of her father a field: and she
lighted from off her ass; and Caleb
said unto her, What wilt thou?
15 And she said unto him, Give me
a blessing: for thou hast given me a
south land; give me also springs of
water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the a nether springs.
16 ¶ And the children of the a Ke­
nite, Moses’ father in law, went up
out of the b city of palm trees with
the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the
south of Arad; and they went and
dwelt among the people.
17 And Judah went with Simeon
his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath,

and utterly destroyed it. And the
name of the city was called Hormah.
18 Also Judah took Gaza with the
a 
coast thereof, and Askelon with
the coast thereof, and Ekron with
the coast thereof.
19 And the Lord was with a Judah;
and he drave out the inhabitants of
the mountain; but could not drive
out the inhabitants of the valley,
because they had b chariots of iron.
20 And they gave Hebron unto
Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled
thence the three sons of Anak.
21 And the children of Benjamin
did not a drive out the b Jebusites
that inhabited Jerusalem; but the
c 
Jebusites dwell with the children
of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this
day.
22 ¶ And the house of Joseph, they
also went up against Beth-el: and
the Lord was with them.
23 And the house of Joseph sent
to descry Beth-el. (Now the name
of the city before was Luz.)
24 And the spies saw a man come
forth out of the city, and they said
unto him, Shew us, we pray thee,
the entrance into the city, and we
will shew thee mercy.
25 And when he shewed them the
entrance into the city, they smote
the city with the edge of the sword;
but they let go the a man and all
his family.
26 And the man went into the land
of the Hittites, and built a city, and
called the name thereof Luz: which
is the name thereof unto this day.
27 ¶ Neither did Manasseh a drive
out the inhabitants of Beth-shean
and her towns, nor Taanach and
her towns, nor the inhabitants of
Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor
the inhabitants of Megiddo and her
towns: but the Canaanites would
dwell in that land.

28 And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the
Canaanites to a tribute, and did not
utterly drive them out.
29 ¶ Neither did Ephraim drive
out the a Canaanites that dwelt in
Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in
Gezer among them.
30 ¶ Neither did Zebulun drive
out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor
the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the
Canaanites dwelt among them, and
became tributaries.
31 ¶ Neither did Asher drive out
the inhabitants of Accho, nor the
inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab,
nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor
of Aphik, nor of Rehob:
32 But the Asherites dwelt among
the Canaanites, the inhabitants of
the land: for they did not drive
them out.
33 ¶ Neither did Naphtali drive out
the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh,
nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath;
but he dwelt among the Canaanites,
the inhabitants of the land: never­
theless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Beth-anath became
tributaries unto them.
34 And the Amorites forced the
children of Dan into the mountain:
for they would not suffer them to
come down to the valley:
35 But the Amorites would dwell
in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in
Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house
of Joseph prevailed, so that they
became tributaries.
36 And the coast of the Amorites
was from the going up to Akrabbim,
from the rock, and upward.

them—He raises up judges to guide and
lead them—The Canaanites are left in
the land to test Israel.
And an angel of the Lord came up
from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I
made you to go up out of Egypt,
and have brought you unto the land
which I sware unto your fathers;
and I said, I will never a break my
b 
covenant with you.
2 And ye shall make no a league
with the inhabitants of this land;
ye shall throw down their altars:
but ye have not b obeyed my voice:
why have ye done this?
3 Wherefore I also said, I will not
drive them out from before you;
but they shall be as thorns in your
sides, and their gods shall be a

4 And it came to pass, when the
angel of the Lord spake these words
unto all the children of Israel, that
the people lifted up their voice,
and wept.
5 And they called the name of that
place Bochim: and they sacrificed
there unto the Lord.
6 ¶ And when Joshua had let the
people go, the children of Israel
went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.
7 And the people a served the Lord
all the days of Joshua, and all the days
of the elders that outlived Joshua,
who had seen all the great works
of the Lord, that he did for Israel.
8 And Joshua the son of a Nun, the
servant of the Lord, died, being an
hundred and ten years old.
9 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim,
on the north side of the hill Gaash.
10 And also all that generation
were gathered unto their fathers:
and there arose another generation
after them, which a knew not the

had done for Israel.

11 ¶ And the children of Israel did
evil in the sight of the Lord, and
served Baalim:
12 And they forsook the Lord God
of their fathers, which brought them
out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the
people that were round about them,
and bowed themselves unto them,
and provoked the Lord to a anger.
13 And they forsook the Lord, and
served a Baal and Ashtaroth.
14 ¶ And the a anger of the Lord
was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of
b 
spoilers that spoiled them, and he
sold them into the hands of their
enemies round about, so that they
could not any longer stand before
their enemies.
15 Whithersoever they went out, the
a 
hand of the Lord was against them
for evil, as the Lord had said, and
as the Lord had sworn unto them:
and they were greatly distressed.
16 ¶ Nevertheless the Lord raised
up a judges, which b delivered them
out of the hand of those that spoiled
them.
17 And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they
went a a whoring after other b gods,
and bowed themselves unto them:
they turned c quickly out of the
way which their fathers walked in,
obeying the commandments of the
Lord; but they did not so.
18 And when the Lord raised them
up judges, then the Lord was with
the judge, and delivered them out
of the hand of their enemies all the
days of the judge: a for it repented
the Lord because of their groanings
by reason of them that oppressed
them and b vexed them.

19 And it came to pass, when the
judge was dead, that they returned,
and corrupted themselves more than
their a fathers, in following other
gods to serve them, and to bow
down unto them; they ceased not
from their own doings, nor from
their b stubborn way.
20 ¶ And the anger of the Lord
was hot against Israel; and he said,
Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not
hearkened unto my voice;
21 I also will not henceforth drive
out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:
22 That through them I may a prove
Israel, whether they will keep the
way of the Lord to b walk therein,
as their fathers did keep it, or not.
23 Therefore the Lord left those
nations, without driving them out
hastily; neither delivered he them
into the hand of Joshua.

The children of Israel intermarry with

Now these are the nations which
the Lord left, to prove Israel by
them, even as many of Israel as had
not known all the wars of Canaan;

children of Israel might know, to

as before knew nothing thereof;

mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath.
4 And they were to prove Israel by
them, to know whether they would
hearken unto the commandments
of the Lord, which he commanded
their fathers by the hand of Moses.
5 ¶ And the children of Israel
a 
dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites,
and Hivites, and Jebusites:
6 And they took their daughters
to be their wives, and a gave their
daughters to their sons, and served
their gods.
7 And the children of Israel did
a 
evil in the sight of the Lord, and
forgat the Lord their God, and
b 
served c Baalim and the d groves.
8 ¶ Therefore the anger of the Lord
was hot against Israel, and he sold
them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia:
and the children of Israel served
Chushan-rishathaim eight years.
9 And when the children of Israel
cried unto the Lord, the Lord raised
up a a deliverer to the children of
Israel, who delivered them, even
Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s
younger brother.
10 And the a Spirit of the Lord
came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the
Lord delivered Chushan-rishathaim
king of Mesopotamia into his hand;
and his hand prevailed against
b 
Chushan-rishathaim.
11 And the land had rest forty
years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz
died.
12 ¶ And the children of Israel
did evil again in the sight of the
Lord: and the Lord strengthened
Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in
the sight of the Lord.

and went and smote Israel, and
possessed the city of palm trees.
14 So the children of Israel served
Eglon the king of Moab eighteen
years.
15 But when the children of Israel
cried unto the Lord, the Lord raised
them up a deliverer, Ehud the son
of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children
of Israel sent a present unto Eglon
the king of Moab.
16 But Ehud made him a dagger
which had two edges, of a cubit
length; and he did gird it under his
raiment upon his right thigh.
17 And he brought the present
unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.
18 And when he had made an end
to offer the present, he sent away
the people that bare the present.
19 But he himself turned again
from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret a errand
unto thee, O king: who said, Keep
silence. And all that stood by him
went out from him.
20 And Ehud came unto him; and
he was sitting in a summer parlour,
which he had for himself alone.
And Ehud said, I have a message
from God unto thee. And he arose
out of his seat.
21 And Ehud put forth his left
hand, and took the dagger from
his right thigh, and thrust it into
his belly:
22 And the a  haft also went in
after the blade; and the fat closed
upon the blade, so that he could not
draw the dagger out of his belly;
and the dirt came out.
23 Then Ehud went forth through
the porch, and shut the doors of the
a 
parlour upon him, and locked them.
24 When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that,

were locked, they said, Surely he

25 And they tarried till they were
ashamed: and, behold, he opened
not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened
them: and, behold, their lord was
fallen down dead on the earth.
26 And Ehud escaped while they
tarried, and passed beyond the
quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.
27 And it came to pass, when he
was come, that he blew a trumpet
in the mountain of Ephraim, and
the children of Israel went down
with him from the mount, and he
before them.
28 And he said unto them, Follow
after me: for the Lord hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into
your hand. And they went down
after him, and took the fords of
Jordan toward Moab, and suffered
not a man to pass over.
29 And they slew of Moab at that
time about ten thousand men, all
a 
lusty, and all men of valour; and
there escaped not a man.
30 So a Moab was b subdued that
day under the hand of Israel. And
the land had rest c fourscore years.

the son of Anath, which slew of the
Philistines six hundred men with

Israel.

that reigned in Hazor; the captain

dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
3 And the children of Israel cried
unto the Lord: for he had nine hundred a chariots of iron; and twenty
years he b mightily c oppressed the
children of Israel.
4 ¶ And Deborah, a a prophetess,
the wife of Lapidoth, she judged
Israel at that time.
5 And she a dwelt under the palm
tree of Deborah between Ramah
and Beth-el in mount Ephraim:
and the children of Israel came up
to her for judgment.
6 And she sent and called a Barak
the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath
not the Lord God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward
mount Tabor, and take with thee
ten thousand men of the children
of Naphtali and of the children of
Zebulun?
7 And I will draw unto thee to the
river Kishon Sisera, the captain of
Jabin’s army, with his chariots and
his multitude; and I will deliver
him into thine hand.
8 And Barak said unto her, If thou
wilt go with me, then I will go: but
if thou wilt not go with me, then I
will not go.
9 And she said, I will surely go
with thee: notwithstanding the
journey that thou takest shall not
be for thine honour; for the Lord
shall sell Sisera into the hand of a
woman. And Deborah arose, and
went with Barak to Kedesh.
10 ¶ And Barak called Zebulun and
Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up
with ten thousand men at his feet:
and Deborah went up with him.
11 Now Heber the Kenite, which was
of the children of Hobab the father
in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched

his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim,
which is by Kedesh.
12 And they shewed Sisera that
Barak the son of Abinoam was gone
up to mount Tabor.
13 And Sisera gathered together all
his chariots, even nine hundred chari­
ots of iron, and all the people that
were with him, from Harosheth of the
Gentiles unto the river of  Kishon.
14 And Deborah said unto Barak,
Up; for this is the day in which the
Lord hath delivered Sisera into
thine hand: is not the Lord gone
out a before thee? So Barak went
down from mount Tabor, and ten
thousand men after him.
15 And the Lord a  discomfited
b 
Sisera, and all his chariots, and all
his host, with the edge of the sword
before Barak; so that Sisera lighted
down off his chariot, and fled away
on his feet.
16 But Barak pursued after the
chariots, and after the host, unto
Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all
the host of Sisera fell upon the edge
of the sword; and there was not a
man left.
17 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his
feet to the tent of Jael the wife of
Heber the Kenite: for there was peace
between Jabin the king of Hazor
and the house of Heber the Kenite.
18 ¶ And Jael went out to meet
Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in,
my lord, turn in to me; fear not.
And when he had turned in unto
her into the tent, she covered him
with a a mantle.
19 And he said unto her, Give me,
I pray thee, a little water to drink;
for I am thirsty. And she opened a
bottle of milk, and gave him drink,
and covered him.
20 Again he said unto her, Stand
in the door of the tent, and it shall
be, when any man doth come and

inquire of thee, and say, Is there any
man here? that thou shalt say, No.
21 Then Jael Heber’s wife took a
nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly
unto him, and smote the a nail into
his b temples, and fastened it into
the ground: for he was fast asleep
and weary. So he died.
22 And, behold, as Barak pursued
Sisera, Jael came out to meet him,
and said unto him, Come, and I
will shew thee the man whom thou
seekest. And when he came into her
tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and
the nail was in his temples.
23 So God subdued on that day
Jabin the king of Canaan before
the children of Israel.
24 And the hand of the children
of Israel prospered, and prevailed
against Jabin the king of Canaan,
until they had destroyed Jabin king
of Canaan.

Chapter 6
Israel is in bondage to the Midianites—An angel appears to Gideon and
calls him to deliver Israel—He overthrows the altar of Baal, the Spirit of
the Lord rests upon him, and the Lord
gives him a sign to show he is called to
deliver Israel.
And the children of Israel did evil
in the sight of the Lord: and the
Lord delivered them into the hand
of Midian seven years.

Israel made them the dens which
are in the mountains, and caves,
and strong holds.
3 And so it was, when Israel had
sown, that the Midianites came up,
and the Amalekites, and the children of the a east, even they came
up against them;
4 And they encamped against
them, and destroyed the a increase
of the earth, till thou come unto
Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.
5 For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came
as grasshoppers for multitude; for
both they and their camels were
without number: and they entered
into the land to destroy it.
6 And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites;
and the children of Israel cried
unto the Lord.
7 ¶ And it came to pass, when the
children of Israel cried unto the
Lord because of the Midianites,
8 That the Lord sent a prophet
unto the children of Israel, which
said unto them, Thus saith the Lord
God of Israel, I brought you up from
Egypt, and brought you forth out

12 And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him, and said unto
him, The Lord is with thee, thou
mighty man of valour.
13 And Gideon said unto him, Oh
my Lord, if the Lord be with us,
why then is all this befallen us? and
where be all his a miracles which our
fathers told us of, saying, Did not
the Lord bring us up from Egypt?
but now the Lord hath forsaken us,
and delivered us into the hands of
the Midianites.
14 And the Lord looked upon him,
and said, Go in this thy a might,
and thou shalt save Israel from the
hand of the Midianites: have not I
sent thee?
15 And he said unto him, Oh my
Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel?
behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the a least in my
father’s house.
16 And the Lord said unto him,
Surely I will be a with thee, and
thou shalt smite the Midianites as
one man.

have found a grace in thy sight, then
shew me a b sign that thou talkest

18 Depart not hence, I pray thee,
until I come unto thee, and bring
forth my present, and set it before
thee. And he said, I will tarry until
thou come again.
19 ¶ And Gideon went in, and
made ready a kid, and unleavened
cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh
he put in a basket, and he put the
broth in a pot, and brought it out
unto him under the oak, and presented it.
20 And the angel of God said unto
him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this
rock, and pour out the broth. And
he did so.

put forth the end of the staff that
was in his hand, and touched the
flesh and the unleavened cakes;
and there rose up a fire out of the
rock, and consumed the flesh and
the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the Lord departed out of his
sight.
22 And when Gideon perceived
that he was an angel of the Lord,
Gideon said, Alas, O Lord God! for
because I have seen an a angel of
the Lord face to b face.
23 And the Lord said unto him,
Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou
shalt not die.
24 Then Gideon built an altar
there unto the Lord, and called it
a 
Jehovah-shalom: unto this day it
is yet in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.
25 ¶ And it came to pass the same
night, that the Lord said unto him,
Take thy father’s young bullock,
even the second bullock of seven
years old, and throw down the altar
of a Baal that thy father hath, and
cut down the b grove that is by it:
26 And build an altar unto the
Lord thy God upon the top of this
a 
rock, in the ordered place, and
take the second bullock, and offer
a burnt sacrifice with the wood of
the grove which thou shalt cut down.
27 Then Gideon took ten men of
his servants, and did as the Lord
had said unto him: and so it was,
because he feared his father’s household, and the men of the city, that
he could not do it by day, that he
did it by night.
28 ¶ And when the men of the city
arose early in the morning, behold,
the altar of Baal was cast down, and
the grove was cut down that was by
it, and the second bullock was off­
ered upon the altar that was built.
29 And they said one to another,
Who hath done this thing? And
when they inquired and asked, they

said, Gideon the son of Joash hath

30 Then the men of the city said
unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that
he may die: because he hath cast
down the altar of Baal, and because
he hath cut down the grove that
was by it.
31 And Joash said unto all that
stood against him, Will ye plead
for Baal? will ye save him? he that
will plead for him, let him be put to
death a whilst it is yet morning: if he
be a god, let him plead for himself,
because one hath cast down his altar.
32 Therefore on that day he called
him a Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal
plead against him, because he hath
thrown down his altar.
33 ¶ Then all the Midianites and
the Amalekites and the children
of the east were gathered together,
and went over, and pitched in the
valley of Jezreel.
34 But the Spirit of the Lord came
upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abi-ezer was gathered after him.

throughout all Manasseh; who also
was gathered after him: and he sent
messengers unto Asher, and unto
Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and
they came up to meet them.
36 ¶ And Gideon said unto God, If
thou wilt save Israel by mine hand,
as thou hast said,
37 Behold, I will put a fleece of
wool in the floor; and if the dew
be on the fleece only, and it be dry
upon all the earth beside, then shall
I know that thou wilt save Israel by
mine hand, as thou hast said.
38 And it was so: for he rose up
early on the morrow, and thrust the
fleece together, and wringed the dew
out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.
39 And Gideon said unto God, Let
not thine a anger be hot against me,
and I will speak but this once: let
me b prove, I pray thee, but this once
with the fleece; let it now be dry

only upon the fleece, and upon all
the ground let there be dew.
40 And God did so that night: for
it was dry upon the fleece only, and
there was dew on all the ground.
Chapter 7
Gideon’s army is reduced to 300—They
frighten the Midianite armies with
trumpets and lights—The Midianites
fight among themselves, flee, and are
defeated by Israel.
Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and
all the people that were with him,
rose up early, and pitched beside
the well of Harod: so that the host
of the Midianites were on the north
side of them, by the hill of Moreh,
in the valley.
2 And the Lord said unto Gideon,
The people that are with thee are
too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel
vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.
3 Now therefore go to, proclaim in
the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is a fearful and afraid, let him
return and depart early from b mount
Gilead. And there returned of the
people twenty and two thousand;
and there remained ten thousand.
4 And the Lord said unto Gideon,
The people are yet too a many; bring
them down unto the water, and I
will b try them for thee there: and
it shall be, that of whom I say unto
thee, This shall go with thee, the
same shall go with thee; and of
whomsoever I say unto thee, This
shall not go with thee, the same
shall not go.
5 So he brought down the people
unto the water: and the Lord said
unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue,
as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou
set by himself; likewise every one
that boweth down upon his knees
to drink.

lapped, putting their hand to their
mouth, were three hundred men:
but all the rest of the people bowed
down upon their knees to drink
water.
7 And the Lord said unto Gideon,
By the three hundred men that
lapped will I save you, and deliver
the Midianites into thine hand: and
let all the other people go every man
unto his place.
8 So the people took a victuals in
their hand, and their trumpets: and
he sent all the rest of Israel every man
unto his tent, and retained those three
hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
9 ¶ And it came to pass the same
night, that the Lord said unto him,
Arise, get thee down unto the host;
for I have delivered it into thine
hand.
10 But if thou fear to go down, go
thou with Phurah thy servant down
to the host:
11 And thou shalt hear what they
say; and afterward shall thine hands
be strengthened to go down unto
the host. Then went he down with
Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were
in the host.
12 And the Midianites and the
Amalekites and all the children of
the east lay along in the valley like
grasshoppers for multitude; and
their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for
multitude.
13 And when Gideon was come,
behold, there was a man that told
a dream unto his fellow, and said,
Behold, I dreamed a a dream, and,
lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled
into the b host of Midian, and came
unto a tent, and smote it that it fell,
and overturned it, that c the tent
lay along.
14 And his fellow answered and
said, This is nothing else save the
sword of Gideon the son of Joash,
a man of Israel: for into his hand

	13	a	 tg  Dream.

hath God delivered Midian, and
all the host.
15 ¶ And it was so, when Gideon
heard the telling of the dream, and
the interpretation thereof, that he
worshipped, and returned into the
host of Israel, and said, Arise; for
the Lord hath delivered into your
hand the host of Midian.
16 And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and
he put a trumpet in every man’s
hand, with empty pitchers, and
lamps within the pitchers.
17 And he said unto them, Look on
me, and do likewise: and, behold,
when I come to the outside of the
camp, it shall be that, as I do, so
shall ye do.
18 When I blow with a trumpet, I
and all that are with me, then blow
ye the trumpets also on every side
of all the camp, and say, The sword
of the Lord, and of Gideon.
19 ¶ So Gideon, and the hundred
men that were with him, came unto
the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and
they had but newly set the watch:
and they blew the trumpets, and
brake the pitchers that were in
their hands.
20 And the three companies blew
the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left
hands, and the trumpets in their
right hands to blow withal: and they
cried, The sword of the Lord, and
of Gideon.
21 And they stood every man in
his place round about the camp: and
all the host ran, and cried, and fled.
22 And the three hundred blew
the trumpets, and the Lord set every man’s sword against his a fellow, even throughout all the host:
and the host fled to Beth-shittah
in Zererath, and to the border of
Abel-meholah, unto Tabbath.
23 And the men of Israel gathered
themselves together out of Naphtali,
and out of Asher, and out of all

Midianites.
24 ¶ And Gideon sent messengers
throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters
unto Beth-barah and Jordan. Then
all the men of Ephraim gathered
themselves together, and took the
waters unto Beth-barah and Jordan.
25 And they took two princes of
the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and
they slew a Oreb upon the rock Oreb,
and Zeeb they slew at the winepress
of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and
brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb
to Gideon on the other side Jordan.
Chapter 8
Gideon pursues and destroys the Midianites—He frees the children of Israel
but refuses their invitation to reign as
king over them—Gideon dies, and Israel returns to idolatry.
And the men of Ephraim said unto
him, Why hast thou served us thus,
that thou calledst us not, when thou
wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him
sharply.
2 And he said unto them, What
have I done now in comparison
of you? Is not the gleaning of the
grapes of Ephraim better than the
vintage of Abi-ezer?
3 God hath delivered into your
hands the princes of Midian, Oreb
and Zeeb: and what was I able to do
in comparison of you? Then their
anger was abated toward him, when
he had said that.
4 ¶ And Gideon came to Jordan,
and passed over, he, and the three
hundred men that were with him,
faint, yet pursuing them.
5 And he said unto the men of
Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of
bread unto the people that follow
me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after a Zebah and Zalmunna,
kings of Midian.
6 ¶ And the princes of Succoth
	23	a	 Isa. 9:4.
	25	a	 Isa. 10:26.

said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zal­
munna now in thine hand, that we
should give bread unto thine army ?
7 And Gideon said, Therefore when
the Lord hath delivered Zebah and
Zalmunna into mine hand, then I
will tear your flesh with the thorns
of the wilderness and with briers.
8 ¶ And he went up thence to
Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth
had answered him.
9 And he spake also unto the men of
Penuel, saying, When I come again in
peace, I will break down this tower.
10 ¶ Now Zebah and Zalmunna
were in Karkor, and their hosts with
them, about fifteen thousand men,
all that were left of all the hosts of
the children of the east: for there
fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.
11 ¶ And Gideon went up by the
way of them that dwelt in tents on
the east of Nobah and Jogbehah,
and smote the host: for the host
was a secure.
12 And when Zebah and Zalmunna
fled, he pursued after them, and
took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited
all the host.
13 ¶ And Gideon the son of Joash
returned from battle before the
sun was up,
14 And caught a young man of
the men of Succoth, and inquired
of him: and he described unto him
the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, even threescore and
seventeen men.
15 And he came unto the men of
Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah
and Zalmunna, with whom ye did
upbraid me, saying, Are the hands
of Zebah and Zalmunna now in
thine hand, that we should give
bread unto thy men that are weary ?
16 And he took the elders of the
city, and thorns of the wilderness
and briers, and with them he taught
the men of Succoth.

17 And he beat down the tower of
Penuel, and slew the men of the city.
18 ¶ Then said he unto Zebah and
Zalmunna, What manner of men
were they whom ye slew at Tabor?
And they answered, As thou art, so
were they; each one resembled the
children of a king.
19 And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother:
as the Lord liveth, if ye had saved
them alive, I would not slay you.
20 And he said unto Jether his
firstborn, Up, and slay them. But
the youth drew not his sword: for he
feared, because he was yet a youth.
21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said,
Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the
man is, so is his strength. And Gideon
arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna,
and took away the ornaments that
were on their camels’ necks.
22 ¶ Then the men of Israel said
unto Gideon, Rule thou over us,
both thou, and thy son, and thy
son’s son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.
23 And Gideon said unto them, I
will not a rule over you, neither shall
my son rule over you: the Lord shall
b 
rule over you.
24 ¶ And Gideon said unto them,
I would desire a request of you,
that ye would give me every man
the earrings of his prey. (For they
had golden earrings, because they
were Ishmaelites.)
25 And they answered, We will
willingly give them. And they spread
a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.
26 And the weight of the a golden
earrings that he requested was a
thousand and seven hundred b shekels of gold; beside c ornaments, and
collars, and purple raiment that
was on the kings of Midian, and
beside the chains that were about
their camels’ necks.

27 And Gideon made an a ephod
thereof, and put it in his city, even in

a whoring after it: which thing became a b snare unto Gideon, and to
his house.
28 ¶ Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that
they lifted up their heads no more.
And the country was in quietness
forty years in the days of Gideon.
29 ¶ And Jerubbaal the son of Joash
went and dwelt in his own house.
30 And Gideon had threescore and
ten sons of his body begotten: for
he had many wives.
31 And his concubine that was in
Shechem, she also bare him a son,
whose name he called Abimelech.
32 ¶ And Gideon the son of Joash
died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his
father, in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.
33 And it came to pass, as soon as
Gideon was dead, that the children
of Israel turned again, and went a
whoring after Baalim, and made
Baal-berith their god.
34 And the children of Israel
remembered not the Lord their
God, who had delivered them out
of the hands of all their enemies
on every side:
35 Neither shewed they kindness
to the house of Jerubbaal, namely,
Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto
Israel.

them, and with all the family of the
house of his mother’s father, saying,
2 Speak, I pray you, in the ears of
all the men of Shechem, Whether
is better for you, either that all the
sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over
you, or that one reign over you?
remember also that I am your bone
and your flesh.
3 And his mother’s brethren spake
of him in the ears of all the men of
Shechem all these words: and their
hearts inclined to follow Abimelech;
for they said, He is our brother.
4 And they gave him threescore
and ten pieces of silver out of the
house of Baal-berith, wherewith
Abimelech a hired b vain and light

5 And he went unto his father’s
house at Ophrah, and slew his
brethren the sons of Jerubbaal,
being threescore and ten persons,

yet Jotham the youngest son of Jer­

6 And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of

men of Shechem, that God may

13 And the vine said unto them,

and let fire come out from the men

fled, and went to a Beer, and dwelt
there, for fear of Abimelech his
brother.
22 ¶ When Abimelech had reigned
three years over Israel,
23 Then God a sent an evil spirit
between Abimelech and the men of
Shechem; and the men of Shechem
dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
24 That the cruelty done to the
threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be
laid upon Abimelech their brother,
which slew them; and upon the men
of Shechem, which aided him in
the killing of his brethren.
25 And the men of Shechem set
a 
liers in wait for him in the top of
the mountains, and they robbed all
that came along that way by them:
and it was told Abimelech.
26 And Gaal the son of Ebed came
with his brethren, and went over to
Shechem: and the men of Shechem
put their confidence in him.
27 And they went out into the
fields, and gathered their vineyards,
and trode the grapes, and made
merry, and went into the house of
their god, and did eat and drink,
and cursed Abimelech.
28 And Gaal the son of Ebed said,
Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him?
is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and
Zebul his officer? serve the men of
a 
Hamor the father of Shechem: for
why should we serve him?
29 And would to God this people
were under my hand! then would
I remove Abimelech. And he said
to Abimelech, Increase thine army,
and come out.
30 ¶ And when Zebul the ruler of
the city heard the words of Gaal the
son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
31 And he sent messengers unto
Abimelech privily, saying, Behold,
Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold,
they a fortify the city against thee.
32 Now therefore up by night, thou
	21	a	 Num. 21:16.
	23	a	 Judg. 9:57 (56–57).
	25	a	 Josh. 8:13.

and the people that is with thee,
and lie in wait in the field:
33 And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou
shalt rise early, and set upon the
city: and, behold, when he and the
people that is with him come out
against thee, then mayest thou do
to them as thou shalt find occasion.
34 ¶ And Abimelech rose up, and
all the people that were with him,
by night, and they laid wait against
Shechem in four companies.
35 And Gaal the son of Ebed went
out, and stood in the entering of the
gate of the city: and Abimelech rose
up, and the people that were with
him, from lying in wait.
36 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there
come people down from the top of
the mountains. And Zebul said unto
him, Thou seest the shadow of the
mountains as if they were men.
37 And Gaal spake again and said,
See there come people down by the
middle of the land, and another
company come along by a the plain
of Meonenim.
38 Then said Zebul unto him,
Where is now thy mouth, wherewith
thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that
we should serve him? is not this the
people that thou hast despised? go
out, I pray now, and fight with them.
39 And Gaal went out before the
men of Shechem, and fought with
Abimelech.
40 And Abimelech chased him,
and he fled before him, and many
were overthrown and wounded, even
unto the entering of the gate.
41 And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and
his brethren, that they should not
dwell in Shechem.
42 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into
the field; and they told Abimelech.
43 And he took the people, and
divided them into three companies,
and laid wait in the field, and looked,

Judges 9:44–10:6

and, behold, the people were come
forth out of the city; and he rose
up against them, and smote them.
44 And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of
the gate of the city: and the two other
companies ran upon all the people
that were in the fields, and slew them.
45 And Abimelech fought against
the city all that day; and he took the
city, and slew the people that was
therein, and beat down the city,
and a sowed it with salt.
46 ¶ And when all the men of the
tower of Shechem heard that, they
entered into an hold of the house
of the god Berith.
47 And it was told Abimelech, that
all the men of the tower of Shechem
were gathered together.
48 And Abimelech gat him up to
mount Zalmon, he and all the people
that were with him; and Abimelech
took an axe in his hand, and cut
down a bough from the trees, and
took it, and laid it on his shoulder,
and said unto the people that were
with him, What ye have seen me do,
make haste, and do as I have done.
49 And all the people likewise cut
down every man his bough, and
followed Abimelech, and put them
to the hold, and set the hold on fire
upon them; so that all the men of
the tower of Shechem died also,
about a thousand men and women.
50 ¶ Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez,
and took it.
51 But there was a strong tower
within the city, and thither fled all
the men and women, and all they
of the city, and shut it to them, and
gat them up to the top of the tower.
52 And Abimelech came unto the
tower, and fought against it, and
went hard unto the door of the
tower to burn it with fire.
53 And a certain woman cast a
piece of a millstone upon a Abim­
elech’s head, and all to brake his
skull.

young man his armourbearer, and
said unto him, Draw thy sword,
and slay me, that men say not of
me, A woman slew him. And his
young man thrust him through,
and he died.
55 And when the men of Israel
saw that Abimelech was dead,
they departed every man unto his
place.
56 ¶ Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did
unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:
57 And all the a evil of the men
of Shechem did God render upon
their heads: and upon them came
the curse of Jotham the son of
Jerubbaal.
Chapter 10
Tola and then Jair judge Israel—The
children of Israel worship false gods,
are forsaken by the Lord, and are distressed by their enemies—They repent
and ask the Lord for deliverance.
And after Abimelech there arose to
a 
defend Israel Tola the son of Puah,
the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar;
and he dwelt in Shamir in mount
Ephraim.
2 And he judged Israel twenty and
three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.
3 ¶ And after him arose Jair, a
Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty
and two years.
4 And he had thirty sons that
rode on thirty ass colts, and they
had thirty cities, which are called
Havoth-jair unto this day, which
are in the land of Gilead.
5 And Jair died, and was buried
in Camon.
6 ¶ And the children of Israel did
evil again in the sight of the Lord,
and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth,
and the gods of Syria, and the gods
of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and

forsook the Lord, and served not
him.
7 And the anger of the Lord was
hot against Israel, and he a sold them
into the hands of the Philistines,
and into the hands of the children
of Ammon.
8 And that year they vexed and
oppressed the children of Israel:
eighteen years, all the children of
Israel that were on the other side
Jordan in the land of the Amorites,
which is in Gilead.
9 Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight
also against Judah, and against
Benjamin, and against the house
of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore
distressed.
10 ¶ And the children of Israel
cried unto the Lord, saying, We have
a 
sinned against thee, both because
we have forsaken our God, and also
served Baalim.
11 And the Lord said unto the
children of Israel, Did not I a deliver
you from the Egyptians, and from
the Amorites, from the children of
Ammon, and from the Philistines?
12 The Zidonians also, and the
Amalekites, and the Maonites, did
oppress you; and ye cried to me, and
I delivered you out of their hand.
13 Yet ye have forsaken me, and
served other gods: wherefore I will
a 
deliver you no more.
14  a Go and cry unto the b gods
which ye have c chosen; let them

15 ¶ And the children of Israel said
unto the Lord, We have sinned: do
thou unto us whatsoever seemeth
good unto thee; deliver us only, we
pray thee, this day.
16 And they a put away the strange
gods from among them, and served
the Lord: and his soul was b grieved
for the misery of Israel.

17 Then the children of Ammon
were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children
of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.
18 And the people and princes of
Gilead said one to another, What
man is he that will begin to fight
against the children of Ammon? he
shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
Chapter 11
Jephthah is chosen as the captain of the
armies of Israel—The Ammonites assail
Israel in war—Jephthah is guided by the
Spirit and defeats Ammon with a great
slaughter—He makes a rash vow, which
leads to the sacrifice of his only daughter.
Now a Jephthah the Gileadite was a
mighty man of valour, and he was
the son of an harlot: and Gilead
begat Jephthah.
2 And Gilead’s wife bare him sons;
and his wife’s sons grew up, and
they thrust out Jephthah, and said
unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in
our father’s house; for thou art the
son of a strange woman.
3 Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob:
and there were gathered a vain men
to Jephthah, and went out with him.
4 ¶ And it came to pass in process
of time, that the children of Ammon
made war against Israel.
5 And it was so, that when the
children of Ammon made war
against Israel, the elders of Gilead
went to fetch Jephthah out of the
land of Tob:
6 And they said unto a Jephthah,
Come, and be our captain, that
we may fight with the children of
Ammon.
7 And Jephthah said unto the
elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate

house? and why are ye come unto
me now when ye are in distress?
8 And the elders of Gilead said
unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn
again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the
children of Ammon, and be our head
over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
9 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home
again to fight against the children of
Ammon, and the Lord deliver them
before me, a shall I be your head?
10 And the elders of Gilead said
unto Jephthah, The Lord be witness between us, if we do not so
according to thy words.
11 Then Jephthah went with the
elders of Gilead, and the people
made him head and captain over
them: and Jephthah uttered all his
words before the Lord in Mizpeh.
12 ¶ And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children
of Ammon, saying, What hast thou
to do with me, that thou art come
against me to fight in my land?
13 And the king of the children
of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel
took away my a land, when they
came up out of Egypt, from b Arnon
even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan:
now therefore restore those lands
again peaceably.
14 And Jephthah sent messengers
again unto the king of the children
of Ammon:
15 And said unto him, Thus saith
Jephthah, Israel took not away the
land of a Moab, nor the land of the
children of Ammon:
16 But when Israel came up from
Egypt, and walked through the
wilderness unto the Red sea, and
came to Kadesh;
17 Then Israel a sent messengers
unto the king of Edom, saying, Let
me, I pray thee, pass through thy
land: but the king of Edom would

head.

not hearken thereto. And in like
manner they sent unto the king of
Moab: but he would not consent: and
Israel abode in Kadesh.
18 Then they went along through
the wilderness, and a compassed
the land of Edom, and the land of
Moab, and came by the east side of
the land of Moab, and pitched on
the other side of Arnon, but came
not within the border of Moab: for
Arnon was the border of Moab.
19 And Israel sent messengers
unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
the king of Heshbon; and Israel said
unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee,
through thy land into my place.
20 But Sihon trusted not Israel to
pass through his a coast: but Sihon
gathered all his people together,
and pitched in Jahaz, and fought
against Israel.
21 And the Lord God of Israel
delivered Sihon and all his people
into the hand of Israel, and they
a 
smote them: so Israel possessed
all the land of the Amorites, the
inhabitants of that country.
22 And they possessed all the
a 
coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon
even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.
23 So now the Lord God of Israel
hath dispossessed the Amorites
from before his people Israel, and
shouldest thou possess it?
24 Wilt not thou possess that which
Chemosh thy god giveth thee to
possess? So whomsoever the Lord
our God shall drive out from before
us, them will we possess.
25 And now art thou any thing better than a Balak the son of Zippor,
king of Moab? did he ever strive
against Israel, or did he ever fight
against them,
26 While Israel dwelt in Heshbon
and her towns, and in Aroer and her
towns, and in all the cities that be
along by the coasts of Arnon, three

hundred years? why therefore did
ye not recover them within that
time?
27 Wherefore I have not sinned
against thee, but thou doest me
wrong to war against me: the Lord
the a Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and
the children of Ammon.
28 Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not
unto the words of Jephthah which
he sent him.
29 ¶ Then the Spirit of the Lord
came upon Jephthah, and he passed
over Gilead, and Manasseh, and
passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and
from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed
over unto the children of Ammon.
30 And Jephthah a vowed a vow
unto the Lord, and said, If thou
shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,
31 Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my
house to meet me, when I return in
peace from the children of Ammon,
shall surely be the Lord’s, and I
will offer it up for a burnt offering.
32 ¶ So Jephthah passed over unto
the children of Ammon to fight
against them; and the Lord delivered them into his hands.
33 And he smote them from Aroer,
even till thou come to a Minnith,
even twenty cities, and unto the
plain of the vineyards, with a very
great slaughter. Thus the children
of Ammon were subdued before
the children of Israel.
34 ¶ And Jephthah came to Mizpeh
unto his house, and, behold, his
a 
daughter came out to meet him
with b timbrels and with dances: and
she was his only child; beside her
he had neither son nor daughter.
35 And it came to pass, when he
saw her, that he rent his clothes, and
said, Alas, my daughter! a thou hast
brought me very low, and thou art
one of them that trouble me: for I

36 And she said unto him, My
father, if thou hast opened thy
mouth unto the Lord, do to me
according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch
as the Lord hath taken vengeance
for thee of thine enemies, even of
the children of Ammon.
37 And she said unto her father,
Let this thing be done for me: let
me alone two months, that I may
go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I
and my fellows.
38 And he said, Go. And he sent her
away for two months: and she went
with her companions, and bewailed
her virginity upon the mountains.
39 And it came to pass at the end
of two months, that she returned
unto her father, who did with her
according to his vow which he had
vowed: and she knew no man. And
it was a custom in Israel,
40 That the daughters of Israel
went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four
days in a year.
Chapter 12
The Gileadites slay 42,000 Ephraimites—Jephthah, Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon

And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went
northward, and said unto Jephthah,
Wherefore passedst thou over to
fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go
with thee? we will burn thine house
upon thee with fire.
2 And Jephthah said unto them, I
and my people were at great a strife
with the children of Ammon; and
when I called you, ye delivered me
not out of their hands.

are ye come up unto me this day,
to fight against me?
4 Then Jephthah gathered together
all the men of Gilead, and fought
with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they
said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of
Ephraim among the Ephraimites,
and among the Manassites.
5 And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those
Ephraimites which were escaped
said, Let me go over; that the men
of Gilead said unto him, Art thou
an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;
6 Then said they unto him, Say
now a Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to
pronounce it right. Then they took
him, and slew him at the passages
of Jordan: and there fell at that
time of the Ephraimites forty and
two thousand.
7 And Jephthah judged Israel six
years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the
cities of Gilead.

thirty daughters, whom he sent

he judged Israel seven years.

Israel ten years.
12 And Elon the Zebulonite died,
and was buried in Aijalon in the

Chapter 13
Israel is in Philistine bondage for forty
years—An angel comes to Manoah’s
wife and promises a son who will begin to deliver Israel—The angel comes
again; he ascends in a flame from the
altar—Samson is born, and the Spirit
of the Lord moves upon him.
And the children of Israel did a evil
again in the sight of the Lord; and
the Lord delivered them into the
b 
hand of the Philistines forty years.
2 ¶ And there was a certain man
of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and
his wife was barren, and bare not.
3 And the a angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman, and said
unto her, Behold now, thou art b barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt

thee, and a drink not wine nor strong

and he shall begin to b deliver Israel

neither told he me his name:

God from the womb to the day of
his death.
8 ¶ Then Manoah entreated the
Lord, and said, O my Lord, let the
man of God which thou didst send
come again unto us, and teach us
what we shall do unto the child
that shall be born.
9 And God hearkened to the voice
of Manoah; and the angel of God
came again unto the woman as she
sat in the field: but Manoah her
husband was not with her.
10 And the woman made haste,
and ran, and shewed her husband,
and said unto him, Behold, the man
hath appeared unto me, that came
unto me the other day.
11 And Manoah arose, and went
after his wife, and came to the man,
and said unto him, Art thou the
man that spakest unto the woman?
And he said, I am.
12 And Manoah said, Now let thy
words come to pass. How shall we
order the child, and how shall we
do unto him?
13 And the angel of the Lord said
unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto
the woman let her beware.
14 She may not eat of any thing
that cometh of the vine, neither
let her drink wine or strong drink,
nor eat any unclean thing: all that
I commanded her let her observe.
15 ¶ And Manoah said unto the
angel of the Lord, I pray thee, let
us detain thee, until we shall have
made ready a kid for thee.
16 And the angel of the Lord said
unto Manoah, Though thou detain
me, I will not eat of thy bread: and
if thou wilt offer a burnt offering,
thou must offer it unto the Lord.
For Manoah knew not that he was
an angel of the Lord.
17 And Manoah said unto the angel of the Lord, What is thy name,
	18	a	 Gen. 32:29.
	19	a	 heb  gift, or offering;
actually this part was

that when thy sayings come to pass
we may do thee honour?
18 And the angel of the Lord said
unto him, Why askest thou thus
after my name, seeing it is a secret?
19 So Manoah took a kid with a
a 
meat b offering, and offered it upon
a rock unto the Lord: and the angel
did wondrously; and Manoah and
his wife looked on.
20 For it came to pass, when the
flame went up toward heaven from
off the altar, that the angel of the
Lord ascended in the flame of
the altar. And Manoah and his
wife looked on it, and fell on their
faces to the ground.
21 But the angel of the Lord did
no more appear to Manoah and to
his wife. Then Manoah knew that
he was an angel of the Lord.
22 And Manoah said unto his wife,
We shall surely die, because we have
a 
seen God.
23 But his wife said unto him,
If the Lord were pleased to kill
us, he would not have received a
burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he
have shewed us all these things, nor
would as at this time have told us
such things as these.
24 ¶ And the woman bare a son,
and called his name Samson: and
the child grew, and the Lord blessed
him.
25 And the Spirit of the Lord began to move him at times in the
camp of Dan between Zorah and
Eshtaol.
Chapter 14
Samson slays a young lion with his bare
hands—He marries a Philistine wife,
propounds a riddle, is deceived by his
wife, and slays thirty Philistines.
And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath
of the daughters of the Philistines.

father and his mother, and said, I

have seen a woman in Timnath of
the daughters of the Philistines: now
therefore get her for me to wife.
3 Then his father and his mother
said unto him, Is there never a
woman among the daughters of thy
brethren, or among all my people,
that thou goest to take a a wife of
the b uncircumcised Philistines? And
Samson said unto his father, Get her
for me; for she pleaseth me well.
4 But his father and his mother
knew not that it was of the a Lord,
that he sought an occasion against
the Philistines: for at that time the
Philistines had b  dominion over
Israel.
5 ¶ Then went Samson down, and
his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of
Timnath: and, behold, a young lion
roared against him.
6 And the a Spirit of the Lord came
mightily upon him, and he rent him
as he would have rent a kid, and he
had nothing in his hand: but he told
not his father or his mother what
he had done.
7 And he went down, and talked
with the woman; and she pleased
Samson well.
8 ¶ And after a time he returned
to take her, and he turned aside to
see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and
honey in the carcase of the lion.
9 And he took thereof in his hands,
and went on eating, and came to
his father and mother, and he gave
them, and they did eat: but he told
not them that he had taken the
honey out of the carcase of the lion.
10 ¶ So his father went down unto
the woman: and Samson made there
a a feast; for so used the young men
to do.
11 And it came to pass, when they
saw him, that they brought thirty
companions to be with him.
12 ¶ And Samson said unto them,

I will now put forth a riddle unto
you: if ye can certainly declare it
me within the seven days of the
feast, and find it out, then I will
give you thirty a sheets and thirty
change of garments:
13 But if ye cannot declare it me,
then shall ye give me thirty sheets
and thirty change of garments. And
they said unto him, Put forth thy
riddle, that we may hear it.
14 And he said unto them, Out of
the eater came forth meat, and out
of the strong came forth sweetness.
And they could not in three days
expound the riddle.
15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson’s wife, a Entice thy husband,
that he may declare unto us the
riddle, lest we b burn thee and thy
father’s house with fire: have ye
called us to take that we have? is it
not so?
16 And Samson’s wife wept before
him, and said, Thou dost but hate
me, and lovest me not: thou hast put
forth a a riddle unto the children
of my people, and hast not told it
me. And he said unto her, Behold,
I have not told it my father nor my
mother, and shall I tell it thee?
17 And she wept before him the
seven days, while their feast lasted:
and it came to pass on the seventh
day, that he told her, because she
a 
lay sore upon him: and she told the
riddle to the children of her people.
18 And the men of the city said
unto him on the seventh day before
the sun went down, What is sweeter
than honey ? and what is stronger
than a lion? And he said unto them,
If ye had not plowed with my heifer,
ye had not found out my riddle.
19 ¶ And the Spirit of the Lord
came upon him, and he went down
to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of
them, and took their spoil, and gave

expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to
his father’s house.
20 But Samson’s wife was given to
his companion, whom he had used
as his friend.
Chapter 15
Samson burns the grain of the Philistines—They burn his wife and father-inlaw—Samson slays a thousand Philistines at Lehi with the jawbone of an ass.
But it came to pass within a while
after, in the time of wheat harvest,
that Samson visited his wife with
a kid; and he said, I will go in to
my wife into the chamber. But her
father would not suffer him to go in.
2 And her father said, I verily
thought that thou hadst utterly
hated her; therefore I gave her to
thy companion: is not her younger
sister fairer than she? take her, I
pray thee, instead of her.
3 ¶ And Samson said concerning
them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I
do them a displeasure.
4 And Samson went and caught
three hundred foxes, and took
firebrands, and turned tail to tail,
and put a firebrand in the midst
between two tails.
5 And when he had set the brands
on fire, he let them go into the
standing corn of the Philistines,
and a burnt up both the shocks, and
also the standing b corn, with the
vineyards and c olives.
6 ¶ Then the Philistines said, Who
hath done this? And they answered,
Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife,
and given her to his companion.
And the Philistines came up, and
a 
burnt her and b her father with fire.

8 And he smote them hip and thigh
with a great slaughter: and he went
down and dwelt in the top of the
rock Etam.
9 ¶ Then the Philistines went up,
and pitched in Judah, and spread
themselves in Lehi.
10 And the men of Judah said,
Why are ye come up against us?
And they answered, To bind Samson
are we come up, to do to him as he
hath done to us.
11 Then three thousand men of
Judah went to the top of the rock
Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are
a 
rulers over us? what is this that
thou hast done unto us? And he
said unto them, As they did unto
me, so have I done unto them.
12 And they said unto him, We
are come down to bind thee, that
we may deliver thee into the hand
of the Philistines. And Samson said
unto them, Swear unto me, that ye
will not fall upon me yourselves.
13 And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast,
and deliver thee into their hand:
but surely we will not kill thee. And
they bound him with two new cords,
and brought him up from the rock.
14 ¶ And when he came unto Lehi,
the Philistines shouted against him:
and the Spirit of the Lord came
mightily upon him, and the cords
that were upon his arms became as
flax that was burnt with fire, and
his bands a loosed from off his hands.
15 And he found a new jawbone
of an ass, and put forth his hand,
and took it, and slew a thousand
men therewith.
16 And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,
with the jaw of an ass have I slain
a thousand men.
17 And it came to pass, when he had
made an end of speaking, that he cast
away the jawbone out of his hand,

into the hand of the uncircumcised?
19 a But God clave an hollow place
that was in the jaw, and there came

he revived: wherefore he called the
name thereof b En-hakkore, which
is in Lehi unto this day.
20 And he judged Israel in the
days of the Philistines twenty years.
Chapter 16
Samson carries away the doors of the
gate of Gaza—He loves Delilah, who
delivers him to the Philistines—He destroys a building, killing himself and
3,000 others.
Then went Samson to Gaza, and
saw there an harlot, and went in
unto her.
2 And it was told the Gazites, saying,
Samson is come hither. And they
a 
compassed him in, and laid wait
for him all night in the gate of the
city, and were quiet all the night,
saying, In the morning, when it is
day, we shall kill him.
3 And Samson lay till midnight,
and arose at midnight, and took
the doors of the gate of the city,
and the two posts, and went away
with them, bar and all, and put
them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill
that is before Hebron.
4 ¶ And it came to pass afterward,
that he loved a woman in the valley
of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
5 And the lords of the Philistines
came up unto her, and said unto
her, a Entice him, and see wherein
his great strength lieth, and by what
means we may prevail against him,

thou mightest be bound to afflict
thee.
7 And Samson said unto her, If they
bind me with seven a green withs
that were never dried, then shall
I be weak, and be as another man.
8 Then the lords of the Philistines
brought up to her seven green withs
which had not been dried, and she
bound him with them.
9 Now there were men lying in wait,
abiding with her in the chamber.
And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he
brake the withs, as a thread of tow
is broken when it toucheth the fire.
So his strength was not known.
10 And Delilah said unto Samson,
Behold, thou hast a mocked me, and
told me lies: now tell me, I pray
thee, wherewith thou mightest be
bound.
11 And he said unto her, If they
bind me fast with new ropes that
never were occupied, then shall I
be weak, and be as another man.
12 Delilah therefore took new
ropes, and bound him therewith,
and said unto him, The Philistines
be upon thee, Samson. And there
were a liers in wait abiding in the
chamber. And he brake them from
off his arms like a thread.
13 And Delilah said unto Samson,
Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and
told me lies: tell me wherewith thou
mightest be bound. And he said unto
her, If thou weavest the seven locks
of my head with the a web.
14 And she fastened it with the
pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he
awaked out of his sleep, and went

15 ¶ And she said unto him, How
canst thou say, I love thee, when
thine heart is not with me? thou
hast a mocked me these three times,
and hast not told me wherein thy
great strength lieth.
16 And it came to pass, when she
pressed him a daily with her words,
and urged him, so that his soul was
b 
vexed unto death;
17 That he told her all his heart,
and said unto her, There hath not
come a a razor upon mine head; for I
have been a Nazarite unto God from
my mother’s womb: if I be shaven,
then my strength will go from me,
and I shall become weak, and be
like any other man.
18 And when Delilah saw that he
had told her all his heart, she sent
and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once,
for he hath shewed me all his heart.
Then the lords of the Philistines
came up unto her, and brought
a 
money in their hand.
19 And she made him sleep upon
her knees; and she called for a man,
and she caused him to shave off the
seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength
went from him.
20 And she said, The Philistines be
upon thee, Samson. And he awoke
out of his sleep, and said, I will go
out as at other times before, and
shake myself. And he a wist not that
the Lord was departed from him.
21 ¶ But the Philistines took him,
and put out his eyes, and brought
him down to Gaza, and bound him
with fetters of brass; and he did
grind in the prison house.
22 Howbeit the hair of his head
began to grow again after he was
shaven.
23 Then the lords of the Philistines
gathered them together for to offer
a great sacrifice unto a Dagon their
god, and to rejoice: for they said,

they praised their god: for they
said, Our god hath delivered into
our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew
many of us.
25 And it came to pass, when their
hearts were merry, that they said,
Call for Samson, that he may make
us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he
made them sport: and they set him
between the pillars.
26 And Samson said unto the lad
that held him by the hand, Suffer
me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may
lean upon them.
27 Now the house was full of men
and women; and all the lords of the
Philistines were there; and there were
upon the roof about three thousand
men and women, that beheld while
Samson made sport.
28 And Samson called unto the
Lord, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and
strengthen me, I pray thee, only
this once, O God, that I may be at
once avenged of the Philistines for
my two eyes.
29 And Samson took hold of the
two middle pillars upon which the
house stood, and on which it was
borne up, of the one with his right
hand, and of the other with his
left.
30 And Samson said, Let me die
with the Philistines. And he bowed
himself with all his might; and the
house fell upon the lords, and upon
all the people that were therein. So
the dead which he slew at his death
were more than they which he slew
in his life.
31 Then his brethren and all the
house of his father came down, and
took him, and brought him up, and
buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah
his father. And he judged Israel
twenty years.

Chapter 17

Micah has a house of gods (images)
and consecrates his own priests.
And there was a man of a mount
Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
2 And he said unto his mother, The
eleven hundred shekels of silver that
were taken from thee, about which
thou cursedst, and spakest of also in
mine ears, behold, the silver is with
me; I took it. And his mother said,
a 
Blessed be thou of the Lord, my son.
3 And when he had restored the
eleven hundred shekels of silver to his
mother, his mother said, I had
wholly dedicated the silver unto the
Lord from my hand for my son, to
make a a graven image and a molten
image: now therefore I will restore
it unto thee.
4 Yet he restored the money unto
his mother; and his mother took
two hundred shekels of silver, and
gave them to the founder, who
made thereof a graven image and
a molten image: and they were in
the house of Micah.
5 And the man Micah had an house
of gods, and made an a ephod, and
b 
teraphim, and consecrated one of
his sons, who became his c priest.
6 In those days there was no a king
in Israel, but every man did that
which was b right in his c own eyes.
7 ¶ And there was a young man out
of Beth-lehem-judah of the family
of Judah, who was a Levite, and he
sojourned there.
8 And the man departed out of the
city from Beth-lehem-judah to a sojourn where he could find a place:
and he came to mount Ephraim to
the house of Micah, as he journeyed.
9 And Micah said unto him,
Whence comest thou? And he said
unto him, I am a a Levite of Bethlehem-judah, and I go to sojourn
where I may find a place.

So the Levite went in.
11 And the Levite was content to
dwell with the man; and the young
man was unto him as one of his sons.
12 And Micah consecrated the
Levite; and the young man became
his priest, and was in the house of
Micah.
13 Then said Micah, Now know
I that the Lord will do me good,
seeing I have a Levite to my priest.

set up idolatry.
In those days there was no a king in
Israel: and in those days the tribe of
the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all
their inheritance had not fallen unto
them among the tribes of Israel.
2 And the children of Dan sent of
their family five men from their
coasts, men of valour, from Zorah,
and from Eshtaol, to spy out the
land, and to search it; and they said
unto them, Go, search the land: who
when they came to mount Ephraim,
to the house of Micah, they lodged
there.
3 When they were by the house of
Micah, they knew the voice of the
young man the Levite: and they
turned in thither, and said unto
him, Who brought thee hither? and
what makest thou in this place?
and what hast thou here?

hath hired me, and I am his priest.

we may know whether our way
which we go shall be prosperous.
6 And the priest said unto them,
Go in peace: before the Lord is your
way wherein ye go.
7 ¶ Then the five men departed,
and came to Laish, and saw the
people that were therein, how they
dwelt a careless, after the manner
of the Zidonians, b quiet and secure;
and there was no magistrate in the
land, that might put them to shame
in any thing; and they were far from
the Zidonians, and had no business
with any man.
8 And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their
brethren said unto them, What say
ye?
9 And they said, Arise, that we
may go up against them: for we
have seen the land, and, behold, it
is very good: and are ye a still? be
not b slothful to go, and to enter to

10 When ye go, ye shall come unto

land: for God hath given it into your

of the family of the Danites, out of
Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men a appointed with weapons of war.
12 And they went up, and pitched
in a Kirjath-jearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place b Mahaneh-dan unto this day: behold,
it is behind Kirjath-jearim.
13 And they passed thence unto

house of Micah.

18 And these went into Micah’s
house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the a teraphim,
and the molten image. Then said
the priest unto them, What do ye?
19 And they said unto him, Hold
thy peace, lay thine a hand upon thy
mouth, and go with us, and be to us
a father and a b priest: is it better for
thee to be a priest unto the house
of one man, or that thou be a priest
unto a tribe and a family in Israel?
20 And the priest’s heart was glad,
and he took the ephod, and the tera­
phim, and the graven image, and
went in the midst of the people.
21 So they turned and departed,
and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.
22 ¶ And when they were a good
way from the house of Micah, the
men that were in the houses near
to Micah’s house were gathered together, and overtook the children
of Dan.
23 And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their
faces, and said unto Micah, What
aileth thee, that thou comest with
such a company ?

25 And the children of Dan said
unto him, Let not thy voice be heard
among us, lest angry fellows run
upon thee, and thou lose thy life,
with the lives of thy household.
26 And the children of Dan went
their way: and when Micah saw
that they were too strong for him,
he turned and went back unto his
house.
27 And they took the things which
Micah had made, and the priest
which he had, and came unto Laish,
unto a people that were at a quiet and
secure: and they smote them with
the edge of the sword, and burnt
the city with fire.
28 And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and
they had no business with any man;
and it was in the valley that lieth by
Beth-rehob. And they built a city,
and dwelt therein.
29 And they called the name of
the city Dan, after the name of Dan
their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city
was Laish at the first.
30 ¶ And the children of Dan set
up the graven image: and Jonathan,
the son of Gershom, the son of a Manasseh, he and his sons were priests
to the tribe of Dan until the day of
the captivity of the land.
31 And they set them up Micah’s
graven image, which he made, all
the time that the a house of God was
in b Shiloh.

A Levite’s concubine returns to her

And it came to pass in those days,
when there was no king in Israel, that
there was a certain a Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim,
who took to him a concubine out
of Beth-lehem-judah.
2 And his concubine played the
whore against him, and went away
from him unto her father’s house
to Beth-lehem-judah, and was there
four whole months.
3 And her husband arose, and went
after her, to speak friendly unto her,
and to bring her again, having his
servant with him, and a couple of
asses: and she brought him into her
father’s house: and when the father
of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced
to meet him.
4 And his father in law, the damsel’s father, retained him; and he
abode with him three days: so they
did eat and drink, and lodged there.
5 ¶ And it came to pass on the
fourth day, when they arose early
in the morning, that he rose up to
depart: and the damsel’s father said
unto his son in law, a Comfort thine
heart with a morsel of bread, and
afterward go your way.
6 And they sat down, and did eat
and drink both of them together:
for the damsel’s father had said
unto the man, Be content, I pray
thee, and tarry all night, and let
thine heart be merry.
7 And when the man rose up to
depart, his father in law urged him:
therefore he lodged there again.
8 And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and
the damsel’s father said, Comfort
thine heart, I pray thee. And they
tarried until afternoon, and they
did eat both of them.
9 And when the man rose up to
depart, he, and his concubine, and
his servant, his father in law, the
damsel’s father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward
evening, I pray you tarry all night:
behold, the day groweth to an end,

lodge here, that thine heart may
be merry; and to morrow get you
early on your way, that thou mayest go home.
10 But the man would not tarry
that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus,
which is Jerusalem; and there were
with him two asses saddled, his
concubine also was with him.
11 And when they were by Jebus,
the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I
pray thee, and let us turn in into this
city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
12 And his master said unto him,
We will not turn aside hither into
the city of a stranger, that is not of
the children of Israel; we will pass
over to Gibeah.
13 And he said unto his servant,
Come, and let us draw near to one
of these places to lodge all night,
in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
14 And they passed on and went
their way; and the sun went down
upon them when they were by a Gibeah,
which belongeth to b Benjamin.
15 And they turned aside thither,
to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and
when he went in, he sat him down
in a street of the city: for there was
no man that took them into his
house to lodging.
16 ¶ And, behold, there came an
old man from his work out of the
field at even, which was also of
mount Ephraim; and he a sojourned
in Gibeah: but the men of the place
were Benjamites.
17 And when he had lifted up his
eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in
the street of the city: and the old
man said, Whither goest thou? and
whence comest thou?
18 And he said unto him, We are
passing from Beth-lehem-judah toward the side of mount Ephraim;
from thence am I: and I went to
Beth-lehem-judah, but I am now going to the house of the Lord; and

there is no man that receiveth me

19 Yet there is both straw and
a 
provender for our asses; and there
is bread and wine also for me, and
for thy handmaid, and for the young
man which is with thy servants: there
is no want of any thing.
20 And the old man said, Peace
be with thee; howsoever let all thy
wants lie upon me; only lodge not
in the street.
21 So he brought him into his
house, and gave a provender unto
the asses: and they washed their
feet, and did eat and drink.
22 ¶ Now as they were making their
hearts merry, behold, the men of
the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat
at the door, and spake to the master
of the house, the old man, saying,
Bring forth the man that came into
thine house, that we may a know him.
23 And the man, the master of the
house, went out unto them, and
said unto them, Nay, my brethren,
nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly;
seeing that this man is come into
mine house, do not this folly.
24 Behold, here is my a daughter a
maiden, and his concubine; them
I will bring out now, and humble
ye them, and do with them what
seemeth good unto you: but unto
this man do not so vile a thing.
25 But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his
concubine, and brought her forth
unto them; and they knew her, and
abused her all the night until the
morning: and when the day began
to spring, they let her go.
26 Then came the woman in the
dawning of the day, and fell down
at the door of the man’s house where
her lord was, till it was light.
27 And her lord rose up in the
morning, and opened the doors of
the house, and went out to go his
way: and, behold, the woman his

28 And he said unto her, Up, and
let us be going. But none answered.
Then the man took her up upon an
ass, and the man rose up, and gat
him unto his place.
29 ¶ And when he was come into
his house, he took a knife, and laid
hold on his concubine, and divided
her, together with her bones, into
twelve pieces, and a sent her into
all the coasts of Israel.
30 And it was so, that all that saw
it said, There was no such deed done

land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak
your minds.
Chapter 20
All Israel arises against the Benjamites,
who refuse to deliver up the men of
Gibeah—The Benjamites are smitten
and destroyed.
Then all the children of Israel went
out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from
Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the
land of Gilead, unto the Lord in
a 
Mizpeh.
2 And the chief of all the people,
even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly
of the people of God, four hundred
thousand footmen that drew sword.
3 (Now the children of Benjamin
heard that the children of Israel
were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said
the children of Israel, Tell us, how
was this wickedness?
4 And the Levite, the husband of
the woman that was slain, answered
and said, I came into a Gibeah that
belongeth to Benjamin, I and my
concubine, to lodge.
5 And the men of Gibeah rose
against me, and beset the house

round about upon me by night, and
thought to have slain me: and my
concubine have they a forced, that
she is dead.
6 And I took my concubine, and cut
her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance
of Israel: for they have committed
lewdness and a folly in Israel.
7 Behold, ye are all children of
Israel; give here your advice and
counsel.
8 ¶ And all the people arose as one
man, saying, We will not any of us
go to his tent, neither will we any
of us turn into his house.
9 But now this shall be the thing
which we will do to Gibeah; we will
go up by lot against it;
10 And we will take ten men of
an hundred throughout all the
tribes of Israel, and an hundred of
a thousand, and a thousand out of
ten thousand, to fetch a victual for
the people, that they may do, when
they come to Gibeah of Benjamin,
according to all the folly that they
have wrought in Israel.
11 So all the men of Israel were
gathered against the city, a knit together as one man.
12 ¶ And the tribes of Israel sent
men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is
this that is done among you?
13 Now therefore deliver us the
men, the children of a Belial, which
are in Gibeah, that we may put them
to death, and put away evil from
Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice
of their brethren the children of
Israel:
14 But the children of Benjamin
gathered themselves together out of
the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to
battle against the children of Israel.
15 And the children of Benjamin
were a numbered at that time out of
the cities twenty and six thousand

16 Among all this people there were
seven hundred chosen men a lefthanded; every one could sling stones
at an hair breadth, and not miss.
17 And the men of Israel, beside
Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword:
all these were men of war.
18 ¶ And the children of Israel
arose, and went up to a the house of
God, and asked counsel of God, and
said, Which of us shall go up first
to the battle against the children
of Benjamin? And the Lord said,
Judah shall go up first.
19 And the children of Israel rose
up in the morning, and a encamped
against Gibeah.
20 And the men of Israel went out
to battle against Benjamin; and the
men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.
21 And the children of Benjamin
came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the
Israelites that day twenty and two
thousand men.
22 And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set
their battle again in array in the
place where they put themselves
in array the first day.
23 (And the children of Israel went
up and wept before the Lord until even, and asked counsel of the
Lord, saying, Shall I go up again to
battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the Lord
said, Go up against him.)
24 And the children of Israel came
near against the children of Benjamin the second day.
25 And Benjamin went forth
against them out of Gibeah the
second day, and destroyed down to
the ground of the children of Israel
again eighteen thousand men; all
these drew the sword.
26 ¶ Then all the children of Israel,

and all the people, went up, and
came unto the a house of God, and
wept, and sat there before the Lord,
and fasted that day until even, and
offered burnt offerings and peace
offerings before the Lord.
27 And the children of Israel inquired of the Lord, (for the ark of
the covenant of God was there in
those days,
28 And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before
it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet
again go out to battle against the
children of Benjamin my brother,
or shall I cease? And the Lord said,
Go up; for to morrow I will deliver
them into thine hand.
29 And Israel set a liers in wait
round about Gibeah.
30 And the children of Israel went
up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as
at other times.
31 And the children of Benjamin
went out against the people, and
were drawn away from the city; and
they began to smite of the people,
and kill, as at other times, in the
highways, of which one goeth up
to the house of God, and the other
to Gibeah in the field, about thirty
men of Israel.
32 And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down
before us, as at the first. But the
children of Israel said, Let us flee,
and draw them from the city unto
the highways.
33 And all the men of Israel rose
up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and
the liers in wait of Israel came forth
out of their places, even out of the
meadows of Gibeah.
34 And there came against Gibeah
ten thousand chosen men out of
all Israel, and the battle was a sore:
but they knew not that evil was
near them.
35 And the Lord smote Benjamin

Judges 20:36–21:6

before Israel: and the children of
Israel destroyed of the Benjamites
that day twenty and five thousand
and an hundred men: all these drew
the sword.
36 So the children of Benjamin
saw that they were smitten: for
the men of Israel gave place to the
Benjamites, because they trusted
unto the liers in wait which they
had set beside Gibeah.
37 And the liers in wait hasted,
and rushed upon Gibeah; and the
liers in wait drew themselves along,
and smote all the city with the edge
of the sword.
38 Now there was an appointed
sign between the men of Israel and
the liers in wait, that they should
make a great flame with smoke rise
up out of the city.
39 And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began
to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they
said, Surely they are smitten down
before us, as in the first battle.
40 But when the flame began to
arise up out of the city with a pillar
of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame
of the city ascended up to heaven.
41 And when the men of Israel
turned again, the men of Benjamin
were amazed: for they saw that evil
was come upon them.
42 Therefore they turned their
backs before the men of Israel unto
the way of the wilderness; but the
battle overtook them; and them
which came out of the cities they
destroyed in the midst of them.
43 Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased
them, and a trode them down with
ease over against Gibeah toward
b 
the sunrising.
44 And there fell of Benjamin
eighteen thousand men; all these
were men of valour.
45 And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock
of Rimmon: and they a gleaned of

them in the highways five thousand
men; and pursued hard after them
unto Gidom, and slew two thousand
men of them.
46 So that all which fell that day
of Benjamin were twenty and five
thousand men that drew the sword;
all these were men of valour.
47 But six hundred men turned
and fled to the wilderness unto
the rock Rimmon, and abode in the
rock Rimmon four months.
48 And the men of Israel turned
again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the
edge of the sword, as well the men
of every city, as the beast, and all
that came to hand: also they set on
fire all the cities that they came to.
Chapter 21
The people lament the desolation of
Benjamin—The inhabitants of Jabeshgilead are destroyed for not engaging
in the war with Benjamin—Wives are
provided for the remnant of Benjamin.
Now the men of Israel had sworn
in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not
any of us give his daughter unto
Benjamin to wife.
2 And the people came to the
house of God, and abode there till
even before God, and lifted up their
voices, and wept sore;
3 And said, O Lord God of Israel,
why is this come to pass in Israel,
that there should be to day one
tribe lacking in Israel?
4 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and
built there an altar, and offered
burnt offerings and peace offerings.
5 And the children of Israel said,
Who is there among all the tribes
of Israel that a came not up with
the b congregation unto the Lord?
For they had made a great oath
concerning him that came not up
to the Lord to Mizpeh, saying, He
shall surely be put to death.

them for Benjamin their brother,

and said, There is one tribe cut off
from Israel this day.
7 How shall we do for wives for
them that remain, seeing we have
sworn by the Lord that we will
not give them of our daughters to
wives?
8 ¶ And they said, What one is there
of the tribes of Israel that came not
up to Mizpeh to the Lord? And, behold, there came none to the camp
from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.
9 For the people were numbered,
and, behold, there were none of
the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead
there.
10 And the congregation sent
thither twelve thousand men of the
valiantest, and commanded them,
saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge
of the sword, with the women and
the children.
11 And this is the thing that ye
shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy
every male, and every woman that
hath lain by man.
12 And they found among the
inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four
hundred young virgins, that had
known no man by lying with any
male: and they brought them unto
the camp to Shiloh, which is in the
land of Canaan.
13 And the whole congregation
sent some to speak to the children
of Benjamin that were in the rock
Rimmon, and to call peaceably
unto them.
14 And Benjamin came again at
that time; and they gave them wives
which they had saved alive of the
women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so
they sufficed them not.
15 And the people repented them
for Benjamin, because that the Lord
had made a breach in the tribes
of Israel.
16 ¶ Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for
wives for them that remain, seeing
	20	a	 Josh. 8:13.
	21	a	 Mosiah 20:1 (1–5).

the women are destroyed out of
Benjamin?
17 And they said, There must be
an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be
not destroyed out of Israel.
18 Howbeit we may not give them
wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying,
Cursed be he that giveth a wife to
Benjamin.
19 Then they said, Behold, there is
a feast of the Lord in Shiloh yearly
in a place which is on the north side
of Beth-el, on the east side of the
highway that goeth up from Beth-el
to Shechem, and on the south of
Lebonah.
20 Therefore they commanded the
children of Benjamin, saying, Go
and a lie in wait in the vineyards;
21 And see, and, behold, if the
daughters of Shiloh come out to
a 
dance in dances, then come ye
out of the vineyards, and catch you
every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land
of Benjamin.
22 And it shall be, when their
fathers or their brethren come unto
us to complain, that we will say unto
them, Be favourable unto them for
our sakes: because we reserved not
to each man his wife in the war: for
ye did not give unto them at this
time, that ye should be a guilty.
23 And the children of Benjamin
did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that
danced, whom they caught: and
they went and returned unto their
inheritance, and repaired the cities,
and dwelt in them.
24 And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every
man to his tribe and to his family,
and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.
25 In those days there was no a king
in Israel: every man did that which
was b right in his own eyes.

ow it came to pass in the
days when the a judges ruled,
that there was a famine in the
land. And a certain man of Bethlehem-judah went to sojourn in the
country of Moab, he, and his wife,
and his two sons.
2 And the name of the man was

wife Naomi, and the name of his two
sons Mahlon and Chilion, b Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they
came into the country of Moab, and

one was Orpah, and the name of

there about ten years.
5 And Mahlon and Chilion died
also both of them; and the woman
was left of her two sons and her

from the country of Moab: for she
had heard in the country of Moab
how that the Lord had visited his
people in giving them bread.
7 Wherefore she went forth out of
the place where she was, and her
two daughters in law with her; and

they went on the way to return unto

daughters in law, Go, return each to
her mother’s house: the Lord deal
kindly with you, as ye have dealt
with the dead, and with me.
9 The Lord grant you that ye may
find rest, each of you in the house
of her husband. Then she kissed
them; and they lifted up their voice,
and wept.
10 And they said unto her, Surely
we will return with thee unto thy
people.
11 And Naomi said, Turn again,
my daughters: why will ye go with
me? are there yet any more a sons in
my womb, that they may be your
husbands?
12 Turn again, my daughters, go
your way; for I am too old to have an
husband. If I should say, I have hope,
if I should have an husband also to
night, and should also bear sons;
13 Would ye tarry for them till
they were grown? would ye stay for
them from having husbands? nay,
my daughters; for it grieveth me
much for your sakes that the hand
of the Lord is gone out against me.

in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou
after thy sister in law.
16 And Ruth said, Entreat me not
to leave thee, or to return from a following after thee: for whither thou
goest, I will b go; and where thou

lodgest, I will lodge: thy c people shall
be my people, and thy God my d God:
17 Where thou diest, will I die, and
there will I be buried: the Lord do
so to me, and more also, if ought but
death part thee and me.
18 When she saw that she was
a 
steadfastly minded to go with her,
then she left speaking unto her.
19 ¶ So they two went until they
came to Beth-lehem. And it came
to pass, when they were come to
Beth-lehem, that all the city was
moved about them, and they said,
Is this Naomi?
20 And she said unto them, Call
me not a Naomi, call me b Mara: for
the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
21 I went out full, and the Lord
hath brought me home again empty:
why then call ye me Naomi, seeing
the Lord hath a testified against me,
and the Almighty hath afflicted me?
22 So Naomi returned, and Ruth
the Moabitess, her daughter in law,
with her, which returned out of the
country of Moab: and they came
to Beth-lehem in the beginning of
barley harvest.
Chapter 2
Ruth gleans in the fields of Boaz, a
near relative of Naomi—He treats
Ruth kindly.
And Naomi had a kinsman of her
husband’s, a mighty man of wealth,
of the family of Elimelech; and his
name was a Boaz.
2 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto
Naomi, Let me now go to the field,
and a glean ears of b corn after him in
whose sight I shall find grace. And
she said unto her, Go, my daughter.
3 And she went, and came, and
gleaned in the field after the reapers:

4 ¶ And, behold, Boaz came from
Beth-lehem, and said unto the reapers, The Lord be with you. And
they answered him, The Lord bless
thee.
5 Then said Boaz unto his servant
that was set over the reapers, Whose
damsel is this?
6 And the servant that was set over
the reapers answered and said, It
is the Moabitish damsel that came
back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:
7 And she said, I pray you, let me
glean and gather after the reapers
among the sheaves: so she came,
and hath continued even from the
morning until now, that she tarried
a little in the house.
8 Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not
to a glean in another field, neither
go from hence, but abide here b fast
by my maidens:
9 Let thine eyes be on the field
that they do reap, and go thou after
them: have I not charged the young
men that they shall not touch thee?
and when thou art athirst, go unto
the vessels, and drink of that which
the young men have drawn.
10 Then she fell on her face, and
bowed herself to the ground, and
said unto him, Why have I found
grace in thine eyes, that thou
shouldest take a knowledge of me,
seeing I am a stranger?
11 And Boaz answered and said
unto her, It hath fully been shewed
me, all that thou hast done unto
thy mother in law since the death
of thine husband: and how thou
hast left thy father and thy mother,
and the land of thy nativity, and
art come unto a people which thou

12 The Lord recompense thy work,
and a full a reward be given thee of
the Lord God of Israel, under whose
b 
wings thou art come to trust.
13 Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that
thou hast comforted me, and for
that thou hast spoken a friendly unto
thine handmaid, though I be not
like unto one of thine handmaidens.
14 And Boaz said unto her, At
mealtime come thou hither, and
eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached
her parched a corn, and she did eat,
and was sufficed, and b left.
15 And when she was risen up to
glean, Boaz commanded his young
men, saying, Let her glean even
among the sheaves, and reproach
her not:
16 And let fall also some of the
handfuls of purpose for her, and
leave them, that she may glean them,
and rebuke her not.
17 So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had
gleaned: and it was about an ephah
of barley.
18 ¶ And she took it up, and went
into the city: and her mother in
law saw what she had gleaned: and
she brought forth, and gave to her
that she had reserved after she was
sufficed.
19 And her mother in law said
unto her, Where hast thou gleaned
to day  ? and where wroughtest thou?
blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she a shewed her
mother in law with whom she had
b 
wrought, and said, The man’s name
with whom I wrought to day is
Boaz.
20 And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the Lord,
who hath not a left off his kindness
to the living and to the dead. And

21 And Ruth the Moabitess said,
He said unto me also, Thou shalt

they have ended all my harvest.
22 And Naomi said unto Ruth
her daughter in law, It is good, my
daughter, that thou go out with his
maidens, that they a meet thee not
in any other field.
23 So she kept fast by the maidens
of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest;
and dwelt with her mother in law.
Chapter 3
By Naomi’s instruction, Ruth lies at the
feet of Boaz—He promises as a relative
to take her as his wife.
Then Naomi her mother in law said
unto her, My daughter, shall I not
seek a rest for thee, that it may be
well with thee?
2 And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou
wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.

anoint thee, and put thy raiment

and lay thee down; and he will tell

5 And she said unto her, All that

he went to lie down at the end of
the heap of a corn: and she came
softly, and uncovered his feet, and
laid her down.
8 ¶ And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid,
and turned himself: and, behold,
a woman lay at his feet.
9 And he said, Who art thou? And
she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt
over thine handmaid; for thou art
a near a kinsman.
10 And he said, Blessed be thou
of the Lord, my daughter: for thou
hast shewed more kindness in the
latter end than at the beginning,
inasmuch as thou followedst not
young men, whether poor or rich.
11 And now, my daughter, fear
not; I will do to thee all that thou
requirest: for all the city of my
people doth know that thou art a
a 
virtuous woman.
12 And now it is true that I am thy
a 
near kinsman: howbeit there is a
kinsman nearer than I.
13 Tarry this night, and it shall
be in the morning, that if he will
perform unto thee the a part of a
kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman’s part: but if he will not do the
part of a kinsman to thee, then will
I do the part of a kinsman to thee,
as the Lord liveth: lie down until
the morning.
14 ¶ And she lay at his feet until
the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And
he said, Let it not be known that a
woman came into the floor.
15 Also he said, Bring the a veil that
thou hast upon thee, and hold it.
And when she held it, he measured
six measures of barley, and laid it
on her: and she went into the city.
16 And when she came to her
mother in law, she said, Who art

18 Then said she, Sit still, my
daughter, until thou know how the
matter will fall: for the man will
not be in rest, until he have finished
the thing this day.
Chapter 4
The nearest relative declines, and Boaz
takes Ruth to wife—Ruth bears Obed,
through whom came David the king.
Then went Boaz up to the a gate,
and sat him down there: and, behold, the b kinsman of whom Boaz
spake came by; unto whom he said,
c 
Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down
here. And he turned aside, and sat
down.
2 And he took ten men of the a elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down
here. And they sat down.
3 And he said unto the kinsman,
Naomi, that is come again out of
the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother
Elimelech’s:
4 And I thought to advertise thee,
saying, a Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my
people. If thou wilt b redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem
it, then tell me, that I may know: for
there is none to redeem it beside
thee; and I am after thee. And he
said, I will redeem it.
5 Then said Boaz, What day thou
buyest the field of the hand of
Naomi, thou must buy it also of
Ruth the Moabitess, the a wife of the
dead, to raise up the b  name of
the dead upon his inheritance.

7 Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning a changing,
for to confirm all things; a man
plucked off his b shoe, and gave it
to his neighbour: and this was a
testimony in Israel.
8 Therefore the kinsman said unto
Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew
off his shoe.
9 ¶ And Boaz said unto the elders,
and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought
all that was Elimelech’s, and all that
was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, of the
hand of Naomi.
10 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess,
the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased
to be my wife, to raise up the name
of the dead upon his inheritance,
that the a name of the dead be not
cut off from among his brethren,
and from the gate of his place: ye
are witnesses this day.
11 And all the people that were in
the gate, and the elders, said, We
are witnesses. The Lord make the
woman that is come into thine house

two did build the house of Israel:
and a do thou worthily in Ephratah,

house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare

Lord shall give thee of this young
woman.
13 ¶ So Boaz took Ruth, and she
was his wife: and when he went in
unto her, the Lord gave her conception, and she bare a son.
14 And the women said unto
Naomi, Blessed be the Lord, which
hath not left thee this day without
a kinsman, that his name may be
famous in Israel.
15 And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher
of thine a old age: for thy daughter
in law, which loveth thee, which
is better to thee than seven sons,
hath born him.
16 And Naomi took the child, and
laid it in her bosom, and became
nurse unto it.
17 And the women her neighbours
gave it a name, saying, There is a
son born to Naomi; and they called
his name Obed: he is the father of
Jesse, the father of David.
18 ¶ Now these are the generations

Hannah prays for a son and vows to

N

ow there was a certain man
of a Ramathaim-zophim, of
mount Ephraim, and his
name was b  Elkanah, the son of
Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son
of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:
2 And he had two wives; the name
of the one was Hannah, and the
name of the other Peninnah: and
Peninnah had children, but Hannah had a no children.
3 And this man went up out of
his city a yearly to worship and to
sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in
b 
Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli,
Hophni and Phinehas, the priests
of the Lord, were there.
4 ¶ And when the time was that
Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and
her daughters, portions:
5 But unto Hannah he gave a
worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the Lord had shut up her
womb.
6 And her adversary also a provoked her sore, for to make her
fret, because the Lord had shut up
her womb.
7 And as he did so year by year,
when she went up to the a house

of the Lord, so she provoked her;
therefore she wept, and did not eat.
8 Then said Elkanah her husband
to her, Hannah, why weepest thou?
and why eatest thou not? and why
is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?
9 ¶ So Hannah rose up after they
had eaten in Shiloh, and after
they had drunk. Now Eli the priest
sat upon a a seat by a post of the
temple of the Lord.
10 And she was in a bitterness of
soul, and prayed unto the Lord,
and wept sore.
11 And she a vowed a b vow, and
said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt
indeed look on the affliction of
thine c handmaid, and remember
me, and not forget thine handmaid,
but wilt give unto thine handmaid
a man child, then I will give him
unto the Lord all the days of his
life, and there shall no d razor come
upon his head.
12 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the Lord,
that Eli a marked her mouth.
13 Now Hannah, she spake in her
heart; only her lips moved, but her
voice was not heard: therefore Eli
thought she had been drunken.
14 And Eli said unto her, How long
wilt thou be drunken? put away thy
wine from thee.
15 And Hannah answered and said,

16 Count not thine handmaid for

the abundance of my complaint
and grief have I spoken hitherto.
17 Then Eli answered and said,
Go in peace: and the God of Israel
grant thee thy petition that thou
hast asked of him.
18 And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So
the woman went her way, and did
eat, and her countenance was no
more sad.
19 ¶ And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before
the Lord, and returned, and came
to their house to a Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the
Lord b remembered her.
20 Wherefore it came to pass, when
the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a
a 
son, and called his name Samuel,
saying, Because I have asked him
of the Lord.
21 And the man Elkanah, and all
his house, went up to offer unto
the Lord the a yearly sacrifice, and
his vow.
22 But Hannah went not up; for
she said unto her husband, I will
not go up until the child be weaned,
and then I will bring him, that he
may appear before the Lord, and
there abide for ever.
23 And Elkanah her husband said
unto her, Do what seemeth thee
good; tarry until thou have weaned
him; only the Lord establish his
word. So the woman abode, and
gave her son suck until she weaned
him.

Lord in Shiloh: and the child was
young.
25 And they slew a bullock, and
brought the child to Eli.
26 And she said, Oh my lord, as
thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the
woman that stood by thee here,
praying unto the Lord.
27 For this a child I prayed; and
the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him:

Hannah sings praises to the Lord—
Samuel ministers before the Lord—Eli
blesses Elkanah and Hannah, and
they have sons and daughters—The
sons of Eli reject the Lord and live in
wickedness—The Lord rejects the house
of Eli.

the child Samuel grew before the
Lord.
22 ¶ Now Eli was very old, and
heard all that his sons did unto all
Israel; and how they lay with the
women that assembled at the door of
the tabernacle of the congregation.
23 And he said unto them, Why do
ye such things? for I hear of your
evil dealings by all this people.
24 Nay, my sons; for it is no good
report that I hear: ye make the
Lord’s people to a transgress.
25 If one man sin against another,
the judge shall a judge him: but if a
man sin against the Lord, who shall
entreat for him? Notwithstanding
they hearkened not unto the voice
of their father, because the Lord
would slay them.
26 And the child Samuel a grew on,
and was in b favour both with the
Lord, and also with men.
27 ¶ And there came a man of God
unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus
saith the Lord, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father,
when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house?
28 And did I a choose him out of all
the tribes of Israel to be my priest,
to offer upon mine altar, to burn
incense, to wear an b ephod before
me? and did I give unto the house
of thy father all the c offerings made
by fire of the children of Israel?
29 Wherefore a kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I
have commanded in my habitation;
and b honourest thy sons above me,
to make yourselves fat with the
chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?

thee, that shall come upon thy two

and shall say, Put me, I pray thee,

I may eat a piece of bread.

And the child Samuel ministered
unto the Lord before Eli. And the
word of the Lord was precious
in those days; there was no open
a 
vision.
2 And it came to pass at that time,
when Eli was laid down in his place,
and his a eyes began to wax dim,
that he could not see;
3 And ere the a lamp of God went
out in the temple of the Lord, where
the ark of God was, and Samuel was
laid down to sleep;
4 That the Lord called Samuel:
and he answered, Here am I.
5 And he ran unto Eli, and said,
Here am I; for thou calledst me.
And he said, I called not; lie down
again. And he went and lay down.
6 And the Lord called yet again,
Samuel. And Samuel arose and went
to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou
didst call me. And he answered, I
called not, my son; lie down again.
7 Now Samuel did not yet know
the Lord, neither was the word of
the Lord yet revealed unto him.
8 And the Lord called Samuel
again the third time. And he arose
and went to Eli, and said, Here am
I; for thou didst call me. And Eli
perceived that the Lord had called
the child.
9 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel,
Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he
call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak,
Lord; for thy servant heareth. So
Samuel went and lay down in his
place.
10 And the Lord came, and a stood,
and called as at other times, Samuel,
Samuel. Then Samuel answered,
Speak; for thy b servant heareth.
11 ¶ And the Lord said to Samuel,

a 
against Eli all things which I have
spoken concerning his house: when
I begin, I will also make an end.
13 For I have told him that I will
a 
judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because
his b sons made themselves vile, and
he c restrained them not.
14 And therefore I have sworn unto
the house of Eli, that the iniquity
of Eli’s house shall not be purged
with sacrifice nor offering for ever.
15 ¶ And Samuel lay until the
morning, and opened the doors of
the house of the Lord. And Samuel
a 
feared to shew Eli the vision.
16 Then Eli called Samuel, and
said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.
17 And he said, What is the thing
that the Lord hath said unto thee? I
pray thee hide it not from me: God
do so to thee, and more also, if thou
hide any thing from me of all the
things that he said unto thee.
18 And Samuel told him every
whit, and hid nothing from him.
And he said, It is the Lord: let him
do what seemeth him good.
19 ¶ And Samuel a grew, and the
b 
Lord was c with him, and did let

Chapter 4

The Israelites are smitten and defeated
by the Philistines, who also capture the
ark of God—Eli’s sons are slain, Eli
dies in an accident, and his daughterin-law dies in childbirth.
And the word of Samuel came to all
Israel. Now Israel went out against
the Philistines to battle, and pitched
beside a Eben-ezer: and the Philistines pitched in b Aphek.
2 And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and
when they joined battle, Israel was
smitten before the Philistines: and
they slew of the army in the field
about four thousand men.
3 ¶ And when the people were
come into the camp, the elders of
Israel said, Wherefore hath the
Lord smitten us to day before the
Philistines? Let us fetch the a ark
of the covenant of the Lord out of
Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh
among us, it may save us out of the
hand of our enemies.
4 So the people sent to Shiloh, that
they might bring from thence the
ark of the covenant of the Lord of
hosts, which dwelleth between the
a 
cherubims: and the two sons of Eli,
Hophni and Phinehas, were there
with the ark of the covenant of God.
5 And when the ark of the covenant
of the Lord came into the camp, all
Israel shouted with a great shout,
so that the earth rang again.
6 And when the Philistines heard
the noise of the shout, they said,
What meaneth the noise of this great
shout in the camp of the Hebrews?
And they understood that the ark of
the Lord was come into the camp.
7 And the Philistines were afraid,
for they said, God is come into the
camp. And they said, Woe unto us!
for there hath not been such a thing
heretofore.
8 Woe unto us! who shall deliver

us out of the hand of these a mighty
Gods? these are the Gods that smote
the Egyptians with all the plagues
in the wilderness.
9 Be strong, and a quit yourselves
like b men, O ye Philistines, that ye
be not c servants unto the Hebrews,
as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.
10 ¶ And the Philistines fought,
and Israel was smitten, and they
fled every man into his tent: and
there was a very great slaughter;
for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
11 And the ark of God was taken;
and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and
Phinehas, were a slain.
12 ¶ And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to
Shiloh the same day with his clothes
a 
rent, and with earth upon his head.
13 And when he came, lo, Eli sat
upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the
ark of God. And when the man
came into the city, and told it, all
the city cried out.
14 And when Eli heard the noise
of the crying, he said, What meaneth
the noise of this tumult? And the
man came in hastily, and told Eli.
15 Now Eli was ninety and eight
years old; and his a eyes were dim,
that he could not see.
16 And the man said unto Eli, I am
he that came out of the army, and I
fled to day out of the army. And he
said, What is there done, my son?
17 And the messenger answered
and said, Israel is fled before the
Philistines, and there hath been also
a great slaughter among the people,
and thy two sons also, Hophni and
Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of
God is taken.
18 And it came to pass, when he
made mention of the ark of God,
that he fell from off the a seat backward by the side of the gate, and his

an old man, and heavy. And he had
judged Israel forty years.
19 ¶ And his daughter in law,
Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near
to be delivered: and when she heard
the tidings that the ark of God
was taken, and that her father in
law and her husband were dead, she
bowed herself and travailed; for her
pains came upon her.
20 And about the time of her death
the women that stood by her said
unto her, Fear not; for thou hast
born a son. But she answered not,
neither did she regard it.
21 And she named the child a Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark
of God was taken, and because of
her father in law and her husband.
22 And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of
God is taken.
Chapter 5
The Philistines place the ark in the
house of Dagon, their god—The Philistines in Ashdod, then Gath, and then
Ekron are plagued and slain because
the ark is lodged with them.
And the Philistines took the a ark
of God, and brought it from b Ebenezer unto Ashdod.
2 When the Philistines took the
a 
ark of God, they brought it into the
house of b Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
3 ¶ And when they of Ashdod
arose early on the morrow, behold,
Dagon was fallen upon his face to
the earth before the ark of the Lord.
And they took Dagon, and set him
in his place again.
4 And when they arose early on the
morrow morning, behold, Dagon was
fallen upon his face to the ground
before the ark of the Lord; and the
head of Dagon and both the palms
of his hands were cut off upon the

was left to him.
5 Therefore neither the priests
of Dagon, nor any that come into
Dagon’s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this
day.
6 But the hand of the Lord was
heavy upon them of Ashdod, and
he destroyed them, and smote them
with a emerods, even Ashdod and the
coasts thereof.
7 And when the men of Ashdod
saw that it was so, they said, The
ark of the God of Israel shall not
abide with us: for his hand is sore
upon us, and upon Dagon our god.
8 They sent therefore and gathered
all the lords of the Philistines unto
them, and said, What shall we do
with the ark of the God of Israel?
And they answered, Let the ark of
the God of Israel be carried about
unto a Gath. And they carried the
ark of the God of Israel about thither.
9 And it was so, that, after they
had carried it about, the a hand of
the Lord was against the city with a
very great destruction: and he smote
the men of the city, both small and
great, and they had emerods in their
secret parts.
10 ¶ Therefore they sent the ark of
God to Ekron. And it came to pass,
as the ark of God came to Ekron,
that the Ekronites cried out, saying,
They have brought about the ark
of the God of Israel to us, to slay us
and our people.
11 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines,
and said, Send away the ark of the
God of Israel, and let it go again to
his own place, that it slay us not, and
our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the
hand of God was very heavy there.
12 And the men that died not were
smitten with the emerods: and the
cry of the city went up to heaven.

Chapter 6

The Philistines send back the ark with
an offering—The Lord smites and slays
the Israelites in Beth-shemesh who look
into the ark.
And the ark of the Lord was in the
country of the Philistines seven
months.
2 And the Philistines called for the
priests and the a diviners, saying,
What shall we do to the ark of the
Lord? tell us wherewith we shall
send it to his place.
3 And they said, If ye send away
the ark of the God of Israel, send
it not empty; but in any wise return him a a trespass offering: then
ye shall be healed, and it shall be
known to you why his hand is not
removed from you.
4 Then said they, What shall be the
trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five
golden emerods, and five golden
mice, according to the number of
the lords of the Philistines: for
one plague was on you all, and on
your lords.
5 Wherefore ye shall make images
of your emerods, and images of
your mice that mar the land; and
ye shall give a glory unto the God of
Israel: peradventure he will lighten
his hand from off you, and from off
your gods, and from off your land.
6 Wherefore then do ye a harden
your hearts, as the Egyptians and
Pharaoh b hardened their hearts?
when he had wrought wonderfully
among them, did they not let the
people go, and they departed?
7 Now therefore make a new cart,
and take two a milch kine, on which
there hath come no yoke, and tie
the kine to the cart, and bring their
calves home from them:
8 And take the ark of the Lord,
and lay it upon the cart; and put
the jewels of gold, which ye return
him for a trespass offering, in a

a 
coffer by the side thereof; and send
it away, that it may go.
9 And see, if it goeth up by the way
of his own coast to Beth-shemesh,
then he hath done us this great evil:
but if not, then we shall know that
it is not his hand that smote us; it
was a chance that happened to us.
10 ¶ And the men did so; and took
two milch kine, and tied them to
the cart, and shut up their calves at
home:
11 And they laid the ark of the
Lord upon the cart, and the coffer
with the mice of gold and the images of their a emerods.
12 And the kine took the straight
way to the way of Beth-shemesh, and
went along the highway, lowing as
they went, and turned not aside to the
right hand or to the left; and the lords
of the Philistines went after them
unto the border of Beth-shemesh.
13 And they of Beth-shemesh were
reaping their wheat harvest in the
valley: and they lifted up their eyes,
and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.
14 And the cart came into the field
of Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and stood
there, where there was a great stone:
and they a clave the wood of the
cart, and offered the kine a burnt
offering unto the Lord.
15 And the Levites took down the
ark of the Lord, and the coffer that
was with it, wherein the jewels of
gold were, and put them on the great
stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh
offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto
the Lord.
16 And when the five lords of the
Philistines had seen it, they returned
to Ekron the same day.
17 And these are the golden em­
erods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto
the Lord; for Ashdod one, for Gaza
one, for Askelon one, for Gath one,
for Ekron one;

to the number of all the cities of
the Philistines belonging to the five
lords, both of a fenced cities, and
of country villages, even unto the
great stone of Abel, whereon they
set down the ark of the Lord: which
stone remaineth unto this day in the
field of Joshua, the Beth-shemite.
19 ¶ And he a smote the men of
Beth-shemesh, because they had
b 
looked into the ark of the Lord,
even he smote of the people fifty
thousand and threescore and ten
men: and the people lamented, because the Lord had smitten many of
the people with a great slaughter.
20 And the men of Beth-shemesh
said, Who is able to stand before
this holy Lord God? and to whom
shall he go up from us?
21 ¶ And they sent messengers to
the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim,
saying, The Philistines have brought
again the a ark of the Lord; come ye
down, and fetch it up to you.
Chapter 7
Samuel exhorts Israel to forsake Ash­
taroth and Baalim and serve the Lord—
Israel fasts and seeks the Lord—The

And the men of Kirjath-jearim
came, and fetched up the a ark of
the Lord, and brought it into the
house of Abinadab in the hill, and
sanctified Eleazar his son to keep
the ark of the Lord.
2 And it came to pass, while the
ark abode in Kirjath-jearim, that
the time was long; for it was twenty
years: and all the house of Israel
lamented after the Lord.

put away a Baalim and Ashtaroth,
and served the Lord only.
5 And Samuel said, Gather all
Israel to a Mizpeh, and I will b pray for
you unto the Lord.
6 And they gathered together to
Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured
it out before the Lord, and fasted
on that day, and said there, We
have a sinned against the Lord. And
Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.
7 And when the Philistines heard
that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords
of the Philistines went up against
Israel. And when the children of
Israel heard it, they were afraid of
the Philistines.
8 And the children of Israel said
to Samuel, a Cease not to cry unto
the Lord our God for us, that he
will save us out of the hand of the
Philistines.
9 ¶ And Samuel took a sucking
lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the Lord: and
Samuel a cried unto the Lord for
Israel; and the Lord b heard him.
10 And as Samuel was offering up
the burnt offering, the Philistines
drew near to battle against Israel:
but the Lord thundered with a
great thunder on that day upon the
Philistines, and a discomfited them;
and they were smitten before Israel.

1 Samuel 7:11–8:13

11 And the men of Israel went out
of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they
came under Beth-car.
12 Then Samuel took a a stone, and
set it between Mizpeh and Shen,
and called the name of it b Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the Lord
helped us.
13 ¶ So the Philistines were a subdued, and they came no more into
the coast of Israel: and the b hand
of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
14 And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were
restored to Israel, from Ekron even
unto Gath; and the coasts thereof
did Israel deliver out of the hands of
the Philistines. And there was peace
between Israel and the Amorites.
15 And Samuel judged Israel all
the days of his life.
16 And he went from year to year
in circuit to Beth-el, and Gilgal,
and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in
all those places.
17 And his return was to Ramah;
for there was his house; and there
he judged Israel; and there he built
an altar unto the Lord.
Chapter 8
Samuel’s sons take bribes and pervert
judgment—The Israelites seek for a king
to rule over them—Samuel rehearses
the nature and evils of kingly rule—
The Lord consents to give them a king.
And it came to pass, when a Samuel
was old, that he made his sons judges
over Israel.
2 Now the name of his firstborn
was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in
Beer-sheba.

ways, but turned aside after lucre,
and took a bribes, and perverted

4 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came
to Samuel unto Ramah,
5 And said unto him, Behold, thou
art old, and thy sons a walk not in thy
ways: now make us a b king to judge
us like all the nations.
6 ¶ But the thing displeased Sam­
uel, when they said, Give us a king
to judge us. And Samuel prayed
unto the Lord.
7 And the Lord said unto Samuel,
Hearken unto the a voice of the people in all that they say unto thee:
for they have not rejected thee,
but they have b rejected me, that I
should not c reign over them.
8 According to all the works which
they have done since the day that I
brought them up out of Egypt even
unto this day, wherewith they have
forsaken me, and served other gods,
so do they also unto thee.
9 Now therefore hearken unto
their voice: howbeit yet a protest solemnly unto them, and shew them
the manner of the b king that shall
c 
reign over them.
10 ¶ And Samuel told all the words
of the Lord unto the people that
asked of him a king.
11 And he said, This will be the
manner of the king that shall reign
over you: He will take your sons,
and appoint them for himself, for his
chariots, and to be his horsemen; and
some shall run before his chariots.
12 And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains
over fifties; and will set them to a ear
his ground, and to reap his harvest,
and to make his instruments of war,
and instruments of his chariots.

to be a confectionaries, and to be

14 And he will take your fields,
and your vineyards, and your olive­
yards, even the best of them, and give
them to his servants.
15 And he will take the a tenth of
your seed, and of your vineyards,
and give to his officers, and to his

16 And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and

18 And ye shall cry out in that
day because of your a king which
ye shall have b chosen you; and the
Lord will not c hear you in that day.
19 ¶ Nevertheless the people refused to a obey the voice of Samuel;
and they said, Nay; but we will have
a king over us;
20 That we also may be like all
the a nations; and that our king may
judge us, and go out before us, and
fight our battles.
21 And Samuel heard all the words
of the people, and he rehearsed
them in the ears of the Lord.
22 And the Lord said to Samuel,
Hearken unto their voice, and make
them a king. And Samuel said unto
the men of Israel, Go ye every man
unto his city.
Chapter 9
Saul, the son of Kish, a Benjamite, is a
choice and goodly person—He is sent
to seek his father’s asses—The Lord
reveals to Samuel the seer that Saul is
to be king—Saul goes to Samuel and
is entertained by him.
Now there was a man of Benjamin,
whose name was a Kish, the son
of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of

Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a
Benjamite, a mighty man of power.
2 And he had a son, whose name
was a Saul, a choice young man, and
a b goodly: and there was not among
the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and
upward he was c higher than any of
the people.
3 And the asses of Kish Saul’s
father were lost. And Kish said to
Saul his son, Take now one of the
servants with thee, and arise, go
seek the asses.
4 And he passed through mount
Ephraim, and passed through the
land of Shalisha, but they found
them not: then they passed through
the land of Shalim, and there they
were not: and he passed through the
land of the Benjamites, but they
found them not.
5 And when they were come to
the land of Zuph, Saul said to his
servant that was with him, Come,
and let us return; lest my father
leave caring for the asses, and take
thought for us.
6 And he said unto him, Behold
now, there is in this city a man of
God, and he is an honourable man;
all that he saith cometh surely to
pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way
that we should go.
7 Then said Saul to his servant,
But, behold, if we go, what shall
we bring the man? for the bread
is spent in our vessels, and there is
not a a present to bring to the man
of God: what have we?
8 And the servant answered Saul
again, and said, Behold, I have here
at hand the fourth part of a shekel
of silver: that will I give to the man
of God, to tell us our way.

spake, Come, and let us go to the b seer:
for he that is now called a c Prophet
was beforetime called a d Seer.)
10 Then said Saul to his servant,
Well said; come, let us go. So they
went unto the city where the man
of God was.
11 ¶ And as they went up the hill
to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and
said unto them, Is the seer here?
12 And they answered them, and
said, He is; behold, he is a before you:
make haste now, for he came to day
to the city; for there is a sacrifice of
the people to day in the high place:
13 As soon as ye be come into the
city, ye shall straightway find him,
before he go up to the high place to
eat: for the people will not eat until
he come, because he doth bless
the sacrifice; and afterwards they
eat that be bidden. Now therefore
get you up; for about this time ye
shall find him.
14 And they went up into the
city: and when they were come into
the city, behold, Samuel came out
a 
against them, for to go up to the
high place.
15 ¶ Now the a Lord had b told
Samuel in his ear a day before Saul
came, saying,
16 To morrow about this time I will
send thee a man out of the land of
Benjamin, and thou shalt a anoint
him to be captain over my people
Israel, that he may save my people
out of the hand of the Philistines:
for I have looked upon my people,
because their b cry is come unto me.
17 And when Samuel saw Saul,
the Lord said unto him, Behold the
man whom I spake to thee of! this
same shall reign over my people.
18 Then Saul drew near to Samuel
in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray
thee, where the seer’s house is.

19 And Samuel answered Saul,
and said, I am the a seer: go up before me unto the high place; for
ye shall eat with me to day, and to
morrow I will let thee go, and will
tell thee all that is in thine heart.
20 And as for thine asses that
were lost three days ago, set not thy
mind on them; for they are found.
And on whom is all the desire of
Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all
thy father’s house?
21 And Saul answered and said, Am
not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of
the tribes of Israel? and my family
the a least of all the families of the
tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then
speakest thou b so to me?
22 And Samuel took Saul and his
servant, and brought them into
the a parlour, and made them sit
in the chiefest place among them
that were bidden, which were about
thirty persons.
23 And Samuel said unto the cook,
Bring the portion which I gave thee,
of which I said unto thee, a Set it
by thee.
24 And the cook took up the a shoulder, and that which was upon it, and
set it before Saul. And Samuel said,
Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time
hath it been kept for thee since I
said, I have invited the people. So
Saul did eat with Samuel that day.
25 ¶ And when they were come
down from the high place into the
city, Samuel communed with Saul
upon the a top of the house.
26 And they arose early: and it
came to pass a about the spring of
the day, that Samuel called Saul to
the top of the house, saying, Up,
that I may send thee away. And
Saul arose, and they went out both
of them, he and Samuel, abroad.

Chapter 10
Samuel anoints Saul to be captain over
the Lord’s inheritance—Samuel manifests the gift of seership—Saul prophesies among the prophets, and the Lord
gives him a new heart—He is chosen
king at Mizpeh.
Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and
poured it upon his head, and kissed
him, and said, Is it not because the
Lord hath a anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?
2 When thou art departed from
me to day, then thou shalt find
two men by Rachel’s sepulchre in
the border of Benjamin at Zelzah;
and they will say unto thee, The
asses which thou wentest to seek
are found: and, lo, thy father hath
left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall
I do for my son?
3 Then shalt thou go on forward
from thence, and thou shalt come
to the plain of Tabor, and there
shall meet thee three men going
up to God to Beth-el, one carrying
three kids, and another carrying
three loaves of bread, and another
carrying a bottle of wine:
4 And they will a salute thee, and
give thee two loaves of bread; which
thou shalt receive of their hands.
5 After that thou shalt come to
the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall
come to pass, when thou art come
thither to the city, that thou shalt
meet a company of prophets coming
down from the high place with a
psaltery, and a tabret, and a a pipe,
and a harp, before them; and they
shall prophesy:

offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices
of peace offerings: seven days shalt
thou tarry, till I come to thee, and
shew thee what thou shalt do.
9 ¶ And it was so, that when he had
turned his back to go from Samuel,
God gave him another a heart: and
all those signs came to pass that
day.
10 And when they came thither
to the hill, behold, a company of
a 
prophets met him; and the b Spirit
of God came upon him, and he
prophesied among them.
11 And it came to pass, when all
that knew him beforetime saw that,
behold, he prophesied among the
prophets, then the people said one
to another, What is this that is come
unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also
among the prophets?
12 And one of the same place
answered and said, But who is
their father? Therefore it became
a proverb, Is a Saul also among the
prophets?
13 And when he had made an
end of prophesying, he came to the
high place.
14 ¶ And Saul’s uncle said unto
him and to his servant, Whither
went ye? And he said, To seek the
asses: and when we saw that they
were no where, we came to Samuel.
15 And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me,
I pray thee, what Samuel said unto
you.

were found. But of the matter of the
kingdom, whereof Samuel spake,
he told him not.
17 ¶ And Samuel called the people
together unto the Lord to Mizpeh;
18 And said unto the children
of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God of
Israel, I brought up Israel out of
Egypt, and delivered you out of the
hand of the Egyptians, and out
of the hand of all kingdoms, and of
them that oppressed you:
19 And ye have this day rejected
your God, who himself saved you
out of all your a adversities and your
b 
tribulations; and ye have said unto
him, Nay, but set a c king over us.
Now therefore present yourselves
before the Lord by your tribes, and
by your thousands.
20 And when Samuel had caused
all the tribes of Israel to come near,
the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
21 When he had caused the tribe
of Benjamin to come near by their
families, the family of Matri was
taken, and Saul the son of Kish
was taken: and when they sought
him, he could not be found.
22 Therefore they a inquired of the
Lord further, if the man should yet
come thither. And the Lord answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.
23 And they ran and fetched him
thence: and when he stood among
the people, he was a higher than any
of the people from his shoulders
and upward.
24 And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the Lord
hath chosen, that there is none like
him among all the people? And all
the people shouted, and said, God
save the king.
25 Then Samuel told the people the
manner of the a kingdom, and b wrote
it in a c book, and laid it up before the
Lord. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.

had touched.
27 But the children of Belial said,
How shall this man a save us? And
they despised him, and brought him

Chapter 11
The Ammonites encamp against the Israelites of Jabesh-gilead—Saul rescues
them and defeats the Ammonites—His
kingship is renewed in Gilgal.
Then Nahash the Ammonite came
up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh
said unto Nahash, Make a covenant
with us, and we will serve thee.
2 And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will
I make a covenant with you, that I
may thrust out all your right eyes,
and lay it for a reproach upon all
Israel.
3 And the elders of Jabesh said
unto him, Give us seven days’ respite, that we may send messengers
unto all the coasts of Israel: and
then, if there be no man to save us,
we will come out to thee.
4 ¶ Then came the messengers to
Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings
in the ears of the people: and all
the people lifted up their voices,
and wept.
5 And, behold, Saul came after
the herd out of the field; and Saul
said, What aileth the people that
they weep? And they told him the
tidings of the men of Jabesh.
6 And the Spirit of God came upon
Saul when he heard those tidings,
and his anger was kindled greatly.

after Saul and after Samuel, so shall
it be done unto his oxen. And the
fear of the Lord fell on the people,
and they came out with one consent.
8 And when he numbered them in
Bezek, the children of Israel were
three hundred thousand, and the
men of Judah thirty thousand.
9 And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say
unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, To
morrow, by that time the sun be hot,
ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed it to the
men of Jabesh; and they were glad.
10 Therefore the men of Jabesh
said, To morrow we will come out
unto you, and ye shall do with us
all that seemeth good unto you.
11 And it was so on the morrow,
that Saul put the people in three
companies; and they came into the
midst of the host in the morning
watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came
to pass, that they which remained
were scattered, so that two of them
were not left together.
12 ¶ And the people said unto
Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall
Saul a reign over us? bring the men,
that we may put them to death.
13 And Saul said, There shall not
a man be put to death this day: for
to day the Lord hath wrought salvation in Israel.
14 Then said Samuel to the people,
Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and
renew the kingdom there.
15 And all the people went to
Gilgal; and there they made Saul
king before the Lord in Gilgal; and
there they sacrificed sacrifices of
peace offerings before the Lord;
and there Saul and all the men of
Israel rejoiced greatly.
Chapter 12
Samuel testifies of his own just dealings
in Israel—He reproves the people for
their ingratitude—He exhorts them to

keep the commandments lest the Lord
consume them and their king.
And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your
voice in all that ye said unto me,
and have made a king over you.
2 And now, behold, the king walketh
before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with
you: and I have a walked before you
from my childhood unto this day.
3 Behold, here I am: witness against
me before the Lord, and before his
anointed: whose ox have I taken? or
whose ass have I taken? or whom
have I a defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any b bribe to blind mine eyes
therewith? and I will restore it you.
4 And they said, Thou hast not
defrauded us, nor oppressed us,
neither hast thou taken ought of
any man’s hand.
5 And he said unto them, The
Lord is witness against you, and his
anointed is witness this day, that ye
have not found ought in my hand.
And they answered, He is witness.
6 ¶ And Samuel said unto the people, It is the Lord that a advanced
Moses and Aaron, and that brought
your fathers up out of the land of
Egypt.
7 Now therefore stand still, that
I may a reason with you before the
Lord of all the righteous acts of
the Lord, which he did to you and
to your fathers.
8 When Jacob was come into Egypt,

1 Samuel 12:10–13:3

10 And they cried unto the Lord,
and said, We have sinned, because
we have forsaken the Lord, and
have served Baalim and Ashtaroth:
but now deliver us out of the hand
of our enemies, and we will serve
thee.
11 And the Lord sent a Jerubbaal,
and Bedan, and b Jephthah, and
Samuel, and delivered you out of
the hand of your enemies on every
side, and ye dwelled safe.
12 And when ye saw that Nahash
the king of the children of Ammon
came against you, ye said unto me,
Nay; but a king shall reign over
us: when the Lord your God was
your a king.
13 Now therefore behold the king
whom ye have chosen, and whom
ye have desired! and, behold, the
Lord hath set a king over you.
14 If ye will fear the Lord, and
serve him, and obey his voice, and
not a rebel against the commandment of the Lord, then shall both
ye and also the king that reigneth
over you continue following the
Lord your God:
15 But if ye will not a obey the voice
of the Lord, but rebel against the
commandment of the Lord, then
shall the b hand of the Lord be
against you, as it was against your
fathers.
16 ¶ Now therefore stand and see
this great thing, which the Lord
will do before your eyes.
17 Is it not wheat harvest to day ?
I will call unto the Lord, and he
shall send thunder and rain; that
ye may perceive and see that your
wickedness is great, which ye have
done in the sight of the Lord, in
asking you a a king.
18 So Samuel called unto the Lord;
and the Lord sent thunder and rain
that day: and all the people greatly
feared the Lord and Samuel.

19 And all the people said unto
Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto
the Lord thy God, that we die not:
for we have added unto all our sins
this evil, to ask us a king.
20 ¶ And Samuel said unto the
people, Fear not: ye have done all
this wickedness: yet a turn not aside
from following the Lord, but serve
the Lord with all your heart;
21 And turn ye not aside: for then
should ye go after vain things, which
cannot a profit nor deliver; for they
are vain.
22 For the Lord will not forsake
his people for his great a name’s sake:
because it hath pleased the Lord
to make you his people.
23 Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the
Lord in ceasing to pray for you:
but I will teach you the good and
the right a way:
24 Only a fear the Lord, and b serve
him in truth with all your heart: for
c 
consider how great things he hath
done for you.
25 But if ye shall still do wickedly,
ye shall be consumed, both ye and
your king.

Saul offers a burnt offering—The Lord
rejects him and chooses another captain
over His people.
Saul reigned one year; and when he
had reigned two years over Israel,
2 Saul chose him three thousand
men of Israel; whereof two thousand
were with Saul in Michmash and
in mount Beth-el, and a thousand
were with Jonathan in Gibeah of
Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
3 And Jonathan smote the garrison
of the Philistines that was in Geba,
and the Philistines heard of it. And
Saul blew the trumpet throughout

all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
4 And all Israel heard say that
Saul had smitten a garrison of the
Philistines, and that Israel also was
had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called
together after Saul to Gilgal.
5 ¶ And the Philistines gathered
themselves together to fight with
Israel, thirty thousand chariots,
and six thousand horsemen, and
people as the sand which is on the
sea shore in multitude: and they
came up, and pitched in Michmash,
eastward from Beth-aven.
6 When the men of Israel saw that
they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the
people did a  hide themselves in
b 
caves, and in thickets, and in rocks,
and in high places, and in pits.
7 And some of the a Hebrews went
over Jordan to the land of Gad and
Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in
Gilgal, and all the people followed
him trembling.
8 ¶ And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel
had appointed: but Samuel came not
to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
9 And a Saul said, Bring hither a
burnt offering to me, and peace off­
erings. And he b offered the c burnt
offering.
10 And it came to pass, that as soon
as he had made an end of offering
the burnt offering, behold, Samuel
came; and Saul went out to meet
him, that he might a salute him.
11 ¶ And Samuel said, What hast
thou done? And Saul said, Because
I saw that the people were scattered
from me, and that thou camest not
within the days appointed, and that
the Philistines gathered themselves
together at Michmash;

12 Therefore said I, The Philistines
will come down now upon me to
Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the Lord: I a forced
myself therefore, and offered a
burnt offering.
13 And Samuel said to Saul, Thou
hast done foolishly: thou hast not
kept the commandment of the Lord
thy God, which he commanded
thee: for now would the Lord have
established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.
14 But now thy a kingdom shall not
continue: the Lord hath b sought him
a c man after his own d heart, and
the Lord hath commanded him to
be captain over his people, because
thou hast not kept that which the
Lord commanded thee.
15 And Samuel arose, and gat
him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of
Benjamin. And Saul numbered the
people that were present with him,
about six hundred men.
16 And Saul, and Jonathan his
son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of
Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
17 ¶ And the spoilers came out of
the camp of the Philistines in three
companies: one company turned
unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah,
unto the land of Shual:
18 And another company turned
the way to Beth-horon: and another
company turned to the way of the
border that looketh to the valley
of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
19 ¶ Now there was no a smith found
throughout all the land of Israel: for
the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews
make them swords or spears:
20 But all the Israelites went down
to the Philistines, to sharpen every
man his a share, and his b coulter, and
his axe, and his mattock.

21 Yet they had a file for the a mattocks, and for the coulters, and for
the forks, and for the axes, and to
sharpen the goads.
22 So it came to pass in the day of
battle, that there was neither sword
nor spear found in the hand of any
of the people that were with Saul and
Jonathan: but with Saul and with
Jonathan his son was there found.
23 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the a passage of
Michmash.
Chapter 14
Jonathan smites the garrison of the Philistines—Saul instructs the people to eat
no food until evening—Unaware of the
oath, Jonathan eats, and Saul decrees
his death—He is rescued by the people
—Saul vexes his enemies on every
hand.
Now it came to pass upon a day,
that Jonathan the son of Saul said
unto the young man that bare his
armour, Come, and let us go over
to the Philistines’ garrison, that is
on the other side. But he told not
his father.
2 And Saul tarried in the uttermost
part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and
the people that were with him were
about six hundred men;
3 And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub,
I-chabod’s brother, the son of Phin­
ehas, the son of Eli, the Lord’s priest
in Shiloh, wearing an a ephod. And
the people knew not that Jonathan
was gone.
4 ¶ And between the a passages, by
which Jonathan sought to go over
unto the Philistines’ garrison, there
was a sharp rock on the one side,
and a sharp rock on the other side:
and the name of the one was Bozez,
and the name of the other Seneh.
5 The forefront of the one was
situate northward over against

Michmash, and the other southward
over against Gibeah.
6 And Jonathan said to the young
man that bare his armour, Come,
and let us go over unto the garrison
of these uncircumcised: it may be
that the Lord will work for us: for
there is no a restraint to the Lord to
save by many or by b few.
7 And his armourbearer said unto
him, Do all that is in thine heart:
a 
turn thee; behold, I am with thee
according to thy heart.
8 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we
will pass over unto these men, and we
will discover ourselves unto them.
9 If they say thus unto us, Tarry
until we come to you; then we will
stand still in our place, and will not
go up unto them.
10 But if they say thus, Come up
unto us; then we will go up: for
the Lord hath delivered them into
our hand: and this shall be a sign
unto us.
11 And both of them a discovered
themselves unto the garrison of the
Philistines: and the Philistines said,
Behold, the Hebrews come forth
out of the b holes where they had
hid themselves.
12 And the men of the garrison
answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to
us, and we will shew you a thing.
And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the
Lord hath a delivered them into the
hand of Israel.
13 And Jonathan climbed up upon
his hands and upon his feet, and
his armourbearer after him: and
they fell before Jonathan; and his
armourbearer slew after him.
14 And that first slaughter, which
Jonathan and his armourbearer
made, was about twenty men, within
as it were an half acre of land, which
a yoke of oxen might plow.
15 And there was trembling in the

host, in the field, and among all
the people: the garrison, and the
spoilers, they also trembled, and
the earth quaked: so it was a very
great trembling.
16 And the watchmen of Saul in
Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and,
behold, the multitude melted away,
and they went on beating down
one another.
17 Then said Saul unto the people
that were with him, Number now,
and see who is gone from us. And
when they had numbered, behold,
Jonathan and his armourbearer
were not there.
18 And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring
hither the ark of God. For the a ark
of God was at that time with the
children of Israel.
19 ¶ And it came to pass, while
Saul talked unto the priest, that
the noise that was in the host of the
Philistines went on and increased:
and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.
20 And Saul and all the people
that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle:
and, behold, every man’s sword was
against his a fellow, and there was a
very great b discomfiture.
21 Moreover the a Hebrews that
were with the Philistines before
that time, which went up with them
into the camp from the country round
about, even they also turned to be
with the Israelites that were with
Saul and Jonathan.
22 Likewise all the men of Israel
which had a hid themselves in mount
Ephraim, when they heard that the
Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
23 So the Lord saved Israel that
day: and the battle passed over unto
Beth-aven.
24 ¶ And the men of Israel were
distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be
the man that eateth any food until

evening, that I may be avenged on
mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.
25 And all they of the land came to
a wood; and there was honey upon
the ground.
26 And when the people were come
into the wood, behold, the honey
dropped; but no man put his hand
to his mouth: for the people feared
the oath.
27 But Jonathan heard not when
his father charged the people with
the oath: wherefore he put forth the
end of the rod that was in his hand,
and dipped it in an honeycomb, and
put his hand to his mouth; and his
eyes were a enlightened.
28 Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father a straitly
charged the people with an oath,
saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.
29 Then said Jonathan, My father
hath troubled the land: see, I pray
you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little
of this honey.
30 How much more, if a haply the
people had eaten freely to day of the
spoil of their enemies which they
found? for had there not been now
a much greater slaughter among
the Philistines?
31 And they smote the Philistines
that day from Michmash to Aijalon:
and the people were very faint.
32 And the people flew upon the
spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,
and calves, and slew them on the
ground: and the people did eat them
with the blood.
33 ¶ Then they told Saul, saying,
Behold, the people sin against the
Lord, in that they eat with the
blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me
this day.
34 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say

man his ox, and every man his sheep,
and slay them here, and eat; and
sin not against the Lord in eating
with the a blood. And all the people
brought every man his ox with him
that night, and slew them there.
35 And Saul built an altar unto
the Lord: the same was the first
altar that he built unto the Lord.
36 ¶ And Saul said, Let us go
down after the Philistines by night,
and spoil them until the morning
light, and let us not leave a man of
them. And they said, Do whatsoever
seemeth good unto thee. Then said
the priest, Let us draw near hither
unto God.
37 And Saul asked counsel of God,
Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into
the hand of Israel? But he a answered
him not that day.
38 And Saul said, Draw ye near
hither, all the chief of the people:
and know and see wherein this sin
hath been this day.
39 For, as the Lord liveth, which
saveth Israel, though it be in Jona­
than my son, he shall surely die.
But there was not a man among all
the people that answered him.
40 Then said he unto all Israel, Be
ye on one side, and I and Jonathan
my son will be on the other side.
And the people said unto Saul, Do
what seemeth good unto thee.
41 Therefore Saul said unto the
Lord God of Israel, a Give a perfect
lot. And Saul and Jonathan were
taken: but the people escaped.
42 And Saul said, Cast lots between
me and Jonathan my son. And
Jonathan was taken.
43 Then Saul said to Jonathan,
Tell me what thou hast done. And
Jonathan told him, and said, I did

of the rod that was in mine hand,
and, lo, I must die.
44 And Saul answered, God do so
and more also: for thou shalt surely
die, Jonathan.
45 And the a  people said unto
Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath
wrought this great salvation in
Israel? God forbid: as the Lord liveth, there shall not one hair of his
head fall to the ground; for he hath
wrought with God this day. So the
people rescued Jonathan, that he
died not.
46 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.
47 ¶ So Saul took the kingdom over
Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab,
and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against
the kings of Zobah, and against the
Philistines: and whithersoever he
turned himself, he vexed them.
48 And he gathered an host, and
smote the Amalekites, and delivered
Israel out of the hands of them that
spoiled them.
49 Now the sons of a Saul were
Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two
daughters were these; the name of the
firstborn b Merab, and the name of
the younger c Michal:

and the name of the captain of his
host was b Abner, the son of Ner,
Saul’s uncle.
51 And a Kish was the father of
Saul; and Ner the father of Abner
was the son of Abiel.
52 And there was a sore war against
the Philistines all the days of Saul:
and when Saul saw any strong man,

unto him.

402

Chapter 15
Saul is commanded to smite and destroy the Amalekites and all that they
have—He saves some animals to sacrifice—Saul is rejected as king and told
that to obey is better than sacrifice—
Samuel destroys Agag.
Samuel also said unto Saul, The
Lord sent me to a anoint thee to be
king over his people, over Israel:
now therefore hearken thou unto
the voice of the words of the Lord.
2 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I
remember that which a Amalek did
to Israel, how he laid wait for him
in the way, when he came up from
Egypt.
3 Now go and smite Amalek, and
utterly a destroy all that they have,
and spare them not; but slay both man
and woman, infant and suckling,
ox and sheep, camel and ass.
4 And Saul gathered the people
together, and numbered them in
Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
5 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
6 ¶ And Saul said unto the a Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from
among the Amalekites, lest I destroy
you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel,
when they came up out of Egypt. So
the Kenites departed from among
the Amalekites.
7 And Saul smote the Amalekites
from Havilah until thou comest to
a 
Shur, that is over against Egypt.
8 And he took a Agag the king of
the Amalekites alive, and utterly
destroyed all the people with the
edge of the sword.
9 But Saul and the people spared
Agag, and the best of the sheep, and
of the oxen, and of the fatlings,
and the lambs, and all that was good,
and would not utterly destroy them:

but every thing that was vile and
refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
10 ¶ Then came the word of the
Lord unto Samuel, saying,
11 a It b repenteth me that I have set
up Saul to be king: for he is turned
back from following me, and hath
not performed my commandments.
And it grieved Samuel; and he cried
unto the Lord all night.
12 And when Samuel rose early
to meet Saul in the morning, it was
told Samuel, saying, Saul came to
Carmel, and, behold, he set him
up a place, and is gone about, and
passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.
13 And Samuel came to Saul: and
Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou
of the Lord: I have performed the
commandment of the Lord.
14 And Samuel said, What meaneth
then this bleating of the sheep in
mine ears, and the lowing of the
oxen which I hear?
15 And Saul said, They have
brought them from the Amalekites:
for the people spared the best of
the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God; and
the rest we have utterly destroyed.
16 Then Samuel said unto Saul,
Stay, and I will tell thee what the
Lord hath said to me this night.
And he said unto him, Say on.
17 And Samuel said, When thou
wast little in thine own sight, wast
thou not made the head of the tribes
of Israel, and the Lord a anointed
thee king over Israel?
18 And the Lord sent thee on a
journey, and said, Go and utterly
destroy the sinners the Amalekites,
and fight against them until they
be consumed.
19 Wherefore then didst thou not
obey the voice of the Lord, but didst
fly upon the spoil, and didst evil
in the sight of the Lord?
20 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea,

I have obeyed the voice of the Lord,
and have gone the way which the
Lord sent me, and have brought
Agag the king of Amalek, and have
utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
21 But the people took of the
spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of
the things which should have been
utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto
the Lord thy God in Gilgal.
22 And Samuel said, Hath the
Lord as great a delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying
the b voice of the Lord? Behold, to
c 
obey is better than d sacrifice, and
to hearken than the fat of e rams.
23 For a rebellion is as the sin of
witchcraft, and b stubbornness is
as iniquity and idolatry. Because
thou hast c rejected the word of the
Lord, he hath also d rejected thee

have a sinned: for I have b transgressed
the commandment of the Lord, and
thy words: because I c feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
25 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with
me, that I may worship the Lord.
26 And Samuel said unto Saul, I
will not return with thee: for thou
hast rejected the word of the Lord,
and the Lord hath rejected thee
from being king over Israel.
27 And as Samuel turned about to
go away, he laid hold upon the skirt
of his mantle, and it a rent.

30 Then he said, I have sinned: yet
honour me now, I pray thee, before
the elders of my people, and before
Israel, and turn again with me, that
I may worship the Lord thy God.
31 So Samuel turned again after
Saul; and Saul worshipped the Lord.
32 ¶ Then said Samuel, Bring ye
hither to me Agag the king of the
Amalekites. And Agag came unto
him delicately. And Agag said,
Surely the bitterness of death
is past.
33 And Samuel said, As thy sword
hath made women childless, so shall
thy mother be childless among
women. And Samuel hewed Agag
in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal.
34 ¶ Then Samuel went to Ramah;
and Saul went up to his house to
Gibeah of Saul.
35 And Samuel came no more to
see Saul until the day of his death:
nevertheless Samuel mourned for
Saul: and a the Lord repented that
he had made Saul king over Israel.
Chapter 16
The Lord chooses David of Bethlehem
as king—He is anointed by Samuel—
Saul chooses David as his companion
and armor bearer.
And the Lord said unto Samuel,
How long wilt thou mourn for Saul,
seeing I have rejected him from
reigning over Israel? fill thine horn
with oil, and go, I will send thee
to a Jesse the b Beth-lehemite: for I
have provided me a c king among
his sons.
2 And Samuel said, How can I go?
if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And
the Lord said, Take an heifer with
thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice
to the Lord.

and I will shew thee what thou shalt
do: and thou shalt a anoint unto me

4 And Samuel did that which the
Lord spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town
trembled at his coming, and said,
Comest thou peaceably ?
5 And he said, Peaceably: I am
come to sacrifice unto the Lord:
a 
sanctify yourselves, and come with
me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called
them to the sacrifice.
6 ¶ And it came to pass, when
they were come, that he looked on
a 
Eliab, and said, Surely the Lord’s
anointed is before him.
7 But the Lord said unto Samuel,
Look not on his countenance, or on
the height of his stature; because I
have refused him: for the Lord a seeth
not as b man seeth; for man looketh
on the outward c appearance, but the
d 
Lord looketh on the e heart.
8 Then Jesse called Abinadab,
and made him pass before Samuel.
And he said, Neither hath the Lord
chosen this.
9 Then Jesse made Shammah to
pass by. And he said, Neither hath
the Lord chosen this.
10 Again, Jesse made seven of his
sons to pass before Samuel. And
Samuel said unto Jesse, The Lord
hath not chosen these.
11 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are
here all thy children? And he said,
There remaineth yet the youngest,
and, behold, he keepeth the sheep.
And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send
and fetch him: for we will not sit
down till he come hither.

in. Now he was ruddy, and withal

of a a beautiful countenance, and
goodly to look to. And the Lord
said, Arise, anoint him: for this
is he.
13 Then Samuel took the horn of
oil, and a anointed him in the midst
of his brethren: and the b Spirit of
the Lord came upon c David from
that day forward. So Samuel rose
up, and went to Ramah.
14 ¶ But the a Spirit of the Lord
b 
departed from Saul, and an evil
spirit c from the Lord troubled him.
15 And Saul’s servants said unto
him, Behold now, an evil spirit
a 
from God troubleth thee.
16 Let our lord now command thy
servants, which are before thee, to
seek out a man, who is a cunning
player on an harp: and it shall come
to pass, when the evil spirit a from
God is upon thee, that he shall
play with his hand, and thou shalt
be well.
17 And Saul said unto his servants,
Provide me now a man that can play
well, and bring him to me.
18 Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen
a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that
is cunning in playing, and a mighty
valiant man, and a man of war, and
a 
prudent in matters, and a comely
person, and the Lord is with him.
19 ¶ Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send
me David thy son, which is with
the sheep.
20 And Jesse took an ass laden with
bread, and a bottle of wine, and a
kid, and sent them by David his son
unto Saul.
21 And David came to Saul, and
stood before him: and he loved
him greatly; and he became his
armourbearer.

22 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying,
Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour
in my sight.
23 And it came to pass, when the
a 
evil spirit b from God was upon
Saul, that David took an harp, and
played with his hand: so Saul was
refreshed, and was well, and the
evil spirit departed from him.
Chapter 17
Israel and the Philistines engage in
war—Goliath of Gath, a giant, defies
Israel and challenges any Israelite to
personal combat—David goes against
him in the name of the Lord—David
slays Goliath with a sling and a stone—
Israel defeats the Philistines.
Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and
were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah,
and pitched between Shochoh and
Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.
2 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and
pitched by the valley of Elah, and
set the battle in array against the
Philistines.
3 And the Philistines stood on a
mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the
other side: and there was a valley
between them.
4 ¶ And there went out a champion
out of the camp of the Philistines,
named Goliath, of a Gath, whose
height was six b cubits and a span.
5 And he had an helmet of brass
upon his head, and he was armed
with a coat of mail; and the weight
of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.
6 And he had a greaves of brass upon
his legs, and b a target of brass between his shoulders.

7 And the a staff of his spear was
like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s
head weighed six hundred shekels
of iron: and one bearing a shield
went before him.
8 And he stood and cried unto the
armies of Israel, and said unto them,
Why are ye come out to set your battle in array ? am not I a Philistine,
and ye servants to Saul? choose you
a man for you, and let him come
down to me.
9 If he be able to fight with me,
and to kill me, then will we be your
servants: but if I prevail against
him, and kill him, then shall ye be
our servants, and serve us.
10 And the Philistine said, I defy
the armies of Israel this day; give me
a man, that we may fight together.
11 When Saul and all Israel heard
those words of the Philistine, they
were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
12 ¶ Now a David was the son of
that Ephrathite of Beth-lehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and
he had eight sons: and the man went
among men for an old man in the
days of Saul.
13 And the three eldest sons of Jesse
went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons
that went to the battle were a Eliab
the firstborn, and next unto him
Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
14 And David was the youngest:
and the three eldest followed Saul.
15 But David went and returned
from Saul to feed his father’s sheep
at Beth-lehem.
16 And the Philistine drew near
morning and evening, and presented
himself forty days.
17 And Jesse said unto David his
son, Take now for thy brethren an
ephah of this parched corn, and these
ten loaves, and run to the camp to
thy brethren;

18 And carry these ten cheeses

and look how thy brethren fare,
and take their pledge.
19 Now Saul, and they, and all the
men of Israel, were in the valley of
Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
20 ¶ And David rose up early in
the morning, and left the sheep
with a keeper, and took, and went,
as Jesse had commanded him; and
he came to the trench, as the host
was going forth to the fight, and
shouted for the battle.
21 For Israel and the Philistines
had put the battle in array, army
against army.
22 And David left his a carriage in
the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and
came and saluted his brethren.
23 And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion,
the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by
name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the
same words: and David heard them.
24 And all the men of Israel, when
they saw the man, fled from him,
and were sore afraid.
25 And the men of Israel said, Have
ye seen this man that is come up?
surely to defy Israel is he come up:
and it shall be, that the man who
killeth him, the king will enrich him
with great riches, and will give him
his daughter, and make his father’s
house free in Israel.
26 And David spake to the men
that stood by him, saying, What
shall be done to the man that kill­
eth this Philistine, and taketh away
the reproach from Israel? for who
is this uncircumcised Philistine,
that he should defy the armies of
the a living God?
27 And the people answered him
after this manner, saying, So shall it
be done to the man that killeth him.
28 ¶ And Eliab his eldest brother
heard when he spake unto the

men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said,
Why camest thou down hither? and
with whom hast thou left those few
sheep in the wilderness? I know thy
pride, and the naughtiness of thine
heart; for thou art come down that
thou mightest see the battle.
29 And David said, What have I
now done? Is there not a cause?
30 ¶ And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the
same manner: and the people answered him again after the former
manner.
31 And when the words were
heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he
sent for him.
32 ¶ And David said to Saul, Let
no man’s heart fail because of him;
thy servant a will go and b fight with
this Philistine.
33 And Saul said to David, Thou
art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou
art but a a youth, and he a man of
war from his youth.
34 And David said unto Saul, Thy
servant kept his father’s sheep, and
there came a lion, and a bear, and
took a lamb out of the flock:
35 And I went out after him, and
smote him, and delivered it out
of his mouth: and when he arose
against me, I caught him by his
beard, and smote him, and slew him.
36 Thy servant slew both the lion
and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of
them, seeing he hath defied the
armies of the living God.
37 David said moreover, The Lord
that a delivered me out of the paw
of the lion, and out of the paw of
the bear, he will b deliver me out
of the hand of this Philistine. And
Saul said unto David, Go, and the
Lord be with thee.
38 ¶ And Saul armed David with
his armour, and he put an helmet of

brass upon his head; also he armed
him with a coat of mail.
39 And David girded his sword
upon his armour, and he assayed
to go; for he had not proved it.
And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not
proved them. And David put them
off him.
40 And he took his staff in his
hand, and chose him five smooth
stones out of the brook, and put
them in a shepherd’s bag which he
had, even in a scrip; and his sling
was in his hand: and he drew near
to the Philistine.
41 And the Philistine came on and
drew near unto David; and the man
that bare the shield went before him.
42 And when the Philistine looked
about, and saw David, he disdained
him: for he was but a youth, and
ruddy, and of a fair countenance.
43 And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a a dog, that thou comest to
me with staves? And the Philistine
cursed David by his gods.
44 And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy
flesh unto the fowls of the air, and
to the beasts of the field.
45 Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a
sword, and with a spear, and with
a shield: but I come to thee in the
a 
name of the Lord of hosts, the God
of the armies of Israel, whom thou
hast defied.
46 This day will the Lord a deliver
thee into mine hand; and I will
smite thee, and take thine head
from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines
this day unto the fowls of the air,
and to the wild beasts of the earth;
that all the earth may b know that
there is a God in Israel.
47 And all this assembly shall
know that the Lord saveth not with
sword and spear: for the a battle is
the Lord’s, and he will give you
into our hands.

48 And it came to pass, when the
Philistine arose, and came and drew
nigh to meet David, that David
hasted, and ran toward the army
to meet the Philistine.
49 And David put his hand in his
bag, and took thence a stone, and
slang it, and smote the Philistine
in his forehead, that the stone sunk
into his forehead; and he fell upon
his face to the earth.
50 So David prevailed over the
Philistine with a sling and with a
stone, and smote the Philistine, and
slew him; but there was no sword in
the hand of David.
51 Therefore David ran, and stood
upon the Philistine, and took his
sword, and drew it out of the sheath
thereof, and slew him, and cut off
his head therewith. And when the
Philistines saw their champion was
dead, they fled.
52 And the men of Israel and
of Judah arose, and shouted, and
pursued the Philistines, until thou
come to the valley, and to the gates
of Ekron. And the wounded of the
Philistines fell down by the way to
Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto
Ekron.
53 And the children of Israel
returned from chasing after the
Philistines, and they spoiled their
tents.
54 And David took the head of the
Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his
tent.
55 ¶ And when Saul saw David go
forth against the Philistine, he said
unto Abner, the captain of the host,
a 
Abner, whose son is this youth?
And Abner said, As thy soul liveth,
O king, I cannot tell.
56 And the king said, Inquire thou
whose son the a stripling is.
57 And as David returned from the
slaughter of the Philistine, Abner
took him, and brought him before
Saul with the head of the Philistine
in his hand.

Chapter 18
Jonathan loves David—Saul sets David over his armies—David is honored
by the people, and Saul becomes jealous—David marries Michal, a daughter
of Saul.
And it came to pass, when he had
made an end of speaking unto Saul,
that the soul of Jonathan was a knit
with the soul of David, and Jonathan
loved him as his own soul.
2 And Saul took him that day, and
would let him go no more home to
his father’s house.
3 Then Jonathan and David made
a a covenant, because he loved him
as his own soul.
4 And Jonathan stripped himself
of the robe that was upon him, and
gave it to David, and his garments,
even to his sword, and to his bow,
and to his girdle.
5 ¶ And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved
himself wisely: and Saul set him
over the men of war, and he was
accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s
servants.
6 And it came to pass as they came,
when David was returned from the
slaughter of the Philistine, that the
a 
women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet
king Saul, with tabrets, with joy,
and with b instruments of musick.
7 And the women answered one
another as they played, and said,
a 
Saul hath slain his thousands, and
David his ten thousands.
8 And Saul was very wroth, and
the saying displeased him; and he
said, They have ascribed unto David
ten thousands, and to me they have

ascribed but thousands: and what
can he have more but the kingdom?
9 And Saul eyed David from that
day and forward.
10 ¶ And it came to pass on the
morrow, that the evil spirit a from
God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and
David played with his hand, as at
other times: and there was a javelin
in Saul’s hand.
11 And Saul cast the javelin; for
he said, I will smite David even to
the wall with it. And David avoided
out of his presence twice.
12 ¶ And Saul was afraid of David,
because the Lord was with him,
and was a departed from Saul.
13 Therefore Saul removed him
from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went
out and came in before the people.
14 And David behaved himself
wisely in all his ways; and the Lord
was with him.
15 Wherefore when Saul saw that
he behaved himself very wisely, he
was afraid of him.
16 But all Israel and a J  udah loved
David, because he went out and
came in before them.
17 ¶ And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter a Merab, her
will I give thee to wife: only be thou
valiant for me, and fight the Lord’s
battles. For Saul said, Let not mine
hand be upon him, but let the hand
of the Philistines be upon him.
18 And David said unto Saul,
Who am I? and what is my life, or
my father’s family in Israel, that I
should be son in law to the king?
19 But it came to pass at the time
when Merab Saul’s daughter should
have been given to David, that she
was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.
20 And Michal Saul’s daughter
loved David: and they told Saul,
and the thing pleased him.

21 And Saul said, I will give him
her, that she may be a snare to him,
and that the hand of the Philistines
may be against him. Wherefore Saul
said to David, Thou shalt this day be
my son in law a in the one of the twain.
22 ¶ And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David
secretly, and say, Behold, the king
hath delight in thee, and all his
servants love thee: now therefore
be the king’s son in law.
23 And Saul’s servants spake those
words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a a light
thing to be a king’s son in law, seeing
that I am a poor man, and lightly
esteemed?
24 And the servants of Saul told
him, saying, On this manner spake
David.
25 And Saul said, Thus shall ye say
to David, The king desireth not any
dowry, but an hundred foreskins of
the Philistines, to be avenged of the
king’s enemies. But Saul thought to
make David fall by the hand of the
Philistines.
26 And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David
well to be the king’s son in law: and
the days were not expired.
27 Wherefore David arose and
went, he and his men, and slew of
the Philistines two hundred men;
and David brought their foreskins,
and they gave them in a full tale to
the king, that he might be the king’s
son in law. And Saul gave him b Michal his daughter to wife.
28 ¶ And Saul saw and knew that
the Lord was with David, and that
Michal Saul’s daughter loved him.
29 And Saul was yet the more
afraid of David; and Saul became
David’s enemy continually.
30 Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass,
after they went forth, that David
behaved himself more wisely than
all the servants of Saul; so that his
name was much a set by.

Saul seeks to kill David—Michal saves
David by artifice—David joins Samuel
and the company of prophets.
And Saul spake to Jonathan his son,
and to all his servants, that they
should kill David.
2 But Jonathan Saul’s son delighted
much in David: and Jonathan told
David, saying, Saul my father
seek­eth to kill thee: now therefore,
I pray thee, take heed to thyself
until the morning, and abide in a
secret place, and hide thyself:
3 And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where
thou art, and I will commune with
my father of thee; and what I see,
that I will tell thee.
4 ¶ And Jonathan spake good of
David unto Saul his father, and
said unto him, Let not the king sin
against his servant, against David;
because he hath not sinned against
thee, and because his works have
been to thee-ward very good:
5 For he did put his life in his
hand, and slew the Philistine, and
the Lord wrought a great salvation
for all Israel: thou sawest it, and
didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt
thou sin against innocent blood, to
slay David without a cause?
6 And Saul hearkened unto the
voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As
the Lord liveth, he shall not be slain.
7 And Jonathan called David, and
Jonathan shewed him all those
things. And Jonathan brought David
to Saul, and he was in his presence,
as in times past.
8 ¶ And there was war again: and
David went out, and fought with
the Philistines, and slew them with
a great slaughter; and they fled
from him.
9 And the evil spirit a from the
Lord was upon Saul, as he sat in his
house with his javelin in his hand:
and David played with his hand.
10 And Saul sought to smite David

even to the wall with the javelin;
but he slipped away out of Saul’s
presence, and he smote the javelin
into the wall: and David fled, and
escaped that night.
11 Saul also sent messengers unto
David’s house, to watch him, and to
slay him in the morning: and Michal David’s wife told him, saying,
If thou save not thy life to night, to
morrow thou shalt be slain.
12 ¶ So Michal let David down
through a window: and he went,
and fled, and escaped.
13 And Michal took an a image, and
laid it in the bed, and put a pillow
of goats’ hair for his bolster, and
covered it with a cloth.
14 And when Saul sent messengers
to take David, she said, He is sick.
15 And Saul sent the messengers
again to see David, saying, Bring
him up to me in the bed, that I
may slay him.
16 And when the messengers were
come in, behold, there was an image
in the bed, with a pillow of goats’
hair for his bolster.
17 And Saul said unto Michal, Why
hast thou deceived me so, and sent
away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul,
He said unto me, Let me go; why
should I kill thee?
18 ¶ So David fled, and escaped,
and came to Samuel to Ramah, and
told him all that Saul had done to
him. And he and Samuel went and
dwelt in Naioth.
19 And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.
20 And Saul sent messengers to
take David: and when they saw the
company of the a prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God
was upon the messengers of Saul,
and they also prophesied.
21 And when it was told Saul, he
sent other messengers, and they
prophesied likewise. And Saul sent
messengers again the third time,
and they prophesied also.
	13	a	 Judg. 17:5.
	20	a	 1 Sam. 10:10.

22 Then went he also to Ramah,
and came to a great well that is
in Sechu: and he asked and said,
Where are Samuel and David? And
one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in
Ramah.
23 And he went thither to Naioth
in Ramah: and the Spirit of God
was upon him also, and he went
on, and prophesied, until he came
to Naioth in Ramah.
24 And he stripped off his clothes
also, and prophesied before Samuel
in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night.
Wherefore they say, Is Saul also
among the a prophets?
Chapter 20
David and Jonathan make a covenant
of friendship and peace—They take
leave of each other.
And David fled from Naioth in
Ramah, and came and said before
Jonathan, What have I done? what
is mine iniquity ? and what is my sin
before thy father, that he seeketh
my life?
2 And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my
father will do nothing either great
or small, but that he will shew it
me: and why should my father hide
this thing from me? it is not so.
3 And David sware moreover, and
said, Thy father certainly knoweth
that I have found grace in thine
eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved:
but truly as the Lord liveth, and
as thy soul liveth, there is but a step
between me and death.
4 Then said Jonathan unto David,
Whatsoever thy soul a desireth, I will
even do it for thee.
5 And David said unto Jonathan,
Behold, to morrow is the new a moon,
and I should not fail to sit with the
king at meat: but let me go, that I
may hide myself in the field unto
the third day at even.
6 If thy father at all miss me, then

1 Samuel 20:7–28

say, David earnestly asked leave
of me that he might run to Beth lehem his city: for there is a yearly
sacrifice there for all the family.
7 If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be
very wroth, then be sure that evil
is determined by him.
8 Therefore thou shalt deal kindly
with thy servant; for thou hast
brought thy servant into a a covenant
of the Lord with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay
me thyself; for why shouldest thou
bring me to thy father?
9 And Jonathan said, Far be it from
thee: for if I knew certainly that evil
were determined by my father to
come upon thee, then would not I
tell it thee?
10 Then said David to Jonathan,
Who shall tell me? or what if thy
father answer thee roughly?
11 ¶ And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into
the field. And they went out both
of them into the field.
12 And Jonathan said unto David,
O Lord God of Israel, when I have
sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and,
behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee,
and shew it thee;
13 The Lord do so and much more
to Jonathan: but if it please my
father to do thee evil, then I will
shew it thee, and send thee away,
that thou mayest go in peace: and
the Lord be with thee, as he hath
been with my father.
14 And thou shalt not only while
yet I live shew me the a kindness of
the Lord, that I die not:
15 But also thou shalt not cut off
thy kindness from my house for
ever: no, not when the Lord hath
cut off the enemies of David every
one from the face of the earth.
16 So Jonathan made a covenant
with the house of David, saying,
Let the Lord even require it at the
hand of David’s enemies.
	8	a	 2 Sam. 21:7.

	14	a	 2 Sam. 9:1.

17 And Jonathan caused David to
 swear again, because he loved him:
for he loved him as he loved his
own soul.
18 Then Jonathan said to David,
To morrow is the new moon: and
thou shalt be missed, because thy
seat will be empty.
19 And when thou hast stayed
three days, then thou shalt go down
quickly, and come to the place
where thou didst hide thyself when
the business was in hand, and shalt
remain by the stone Ezel.
20 And I will shoot three arrows
on the side thereof, as though I shot
at a mark.
21 And, behold, I will send a lad,
saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I
expressly say unto the lad, Behold,
the arrows are on this side of thee,
take them; then come thou: for there
is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the
Lord liveth.
22 But if I say thus unto the young
man, Behold, the arrows are beyond
thee; go thy way: for the Lord hath
sent thee away.
23 And as touching the matter
which thou and I have spoken of,
behold, the Lord be between thee
and me for ever.
24 ¶ So David hid himself in the
field: and when the new moon was
come, the king sat him down to
eat meat.
25 And the king sat upon his seat,
as at other times, even upon a seat
by the wall: and Jonathan arose,
and Abner sat by Saul’s side, and
David’s place was empty.
26 Nevertheless Saul spake not
any thing that day: for he thought,
Something hath befallen him, he
is not clean; surely he is not clean.
27 And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of
the month, that David’s place was
empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan
his son, Wherefore cometh not the
son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?
28 And Jonathan answered Saul,

1 Samuel 20:29–21:5

412

David earnestly asked leave of me
to go to Beth-lehem:
29 And he said, Let me go, I pray
thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he
hath commanded me to be there: and
now, if I have found favour in thine
eyes, let me get away, I pray thee,
and see my brethren. Therefore he
cometh not unto the king’s table.
30 Then Saul’s a anger was kindled
against Jonathan, and he said unto
him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that
thou hast chosen the son of Jesse
to thine own confusion, and unto
the confusion of thy mother’s nakedness?
31 For as long as the son of Jesse
liveth upon the ground, thou shalt
not be a established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch
him unto me, for he shall surely die.
32 And Jonathan answered Saul his
father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath
he done?
33 And Saul cast a javelin at him
to smite him: whereby Jonathan
knew that it was determined of his
father to slay David.
34 So Jonathan arose from the table
in fierce anger, and did eat no meat
the second day of the month: for he
was grieved for David, because his
father had done him shame.
35 ¶ And it came to pass in the
morning, that Jonathan went out
into the field at the time appointed
with David, and a little lad with him.
36 And he said unto his lad, Run,
find out now the arrows which I
shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot
an arrow beyond him.
37 And when the lad was come to
the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after
the lad, and said, Is not the arrow
beyond thee?
38 And Jonathan cried after the
lad, Make speed, haste, stay not.
And Jonathan’s lad gathered up
the arrows, and came to his master.
	30	a	 tg  Anger.
	31	a	 1 Sam. 23:17.

39 But the lad knew not any thing:
only Jonathan and David knew the
matter.
40 And Jonathan gave his artillery
unto his lad, and said unto him, Go,
carry them to the city.
41 ¶ And as soon as the lad was
gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face
to the ground, and bowed himself
three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another,
until David exceeded.
42 And a Jonathan said to David,
Go in peace, forasmuch as we have
sworn both of us in the name of the
Lord, saying, The Lord be between
me and thee, and between my seed
and thy seed for ever. And he arose
and departed: and Jonathan went
into the city.
Chapter 21
David gets help from Ahimelech the
priest—He eats the shewbread—He goes
to Gath, where he pretends madness.
Then came David to a Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was
afraid at the meeting of David, and
said unto him, Why art thou alone,
and no man with thee?
2 And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath
said unto me, Let no man know any
thing of the business whereabout
I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed
my servants to such and such a
place.
3 Now therefore what is under
thine hand? give me five loaves of
bread in mine hand, or what there
is present.
4 And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common
bread under mine hand, but there
is a hallowed b bread; if the young
men have kept themselves at least
from women.
5 And David answered the priest,
and said unto him, Of a truth women

have been kept from us about these
three days, since I came out, and
the vessels of the young men are
holy, and the bread is in a manner
common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.
6 So the priest gave him a hallowed
bread: for there was no bread there
but the b shewbread, that was taken
from before the Lord, to put hot
bread in the day when it was taken
away.
7 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,
detained before the Lord; and his
name was a Doeg, an Edomite, the
chiefest of the herdmen that belonged
to Saul.
8 ¶ And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under
thine hand spear or sword? for I
have neither brought my sword
nor my weapons with me, because
the king’s business required haste.
9 And the priest said, The sword
of Goliath the Philistine, whom
thou slewest in the valley of Elah,
behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth
behind the ephod: if thou wilt take
that, take it: for there is no other save
that here. And David said, There is
none like that; give it me.
10 ¶ And David arose, and fled
that day for fear of Saul, and went
to Achish the king of Gath.
11 And the servants of Achish said
unto him, Is not this David the king
of the land? did they not a sing one
to another of him in dances, saying,
Saul hath slain his thousands, and
David his ten thousands?
12 And David laid up these words
in his heart, and was sore afraid of
Achish the king of Gath.
13 And he changed his behaviour
before them, and feigned himself
mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and
let his a spittle fall down upon his
beard.
14 Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad:
	6	a	 Matt. 12:3 (3–4).
		b	 Luke 6:4 (3–4).
	7	a	 1 Sam. 22:9.

wherefore then have ye brought
him to me?
15 Have I need of mad men, that
ye have brought this fellow to play
the mad man in my presence? shall
this fellow come into my house?
Chapter 22
David gains followers—He goes from
one place to another, fleeing from Saul—
Saul slays the priests who showed kindness to David.
David therefore departed thence,
and escaped to the cave Adullam:
and when his brethren and all his
father’s house heard it, they went
down thither to him.
2 And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt,
and every one that was discontented,
gathered themselves unto him; and
he became a captain over them: and
there were with him about four
hundred men.
3 ¶ And David went thence to
Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto
the king of Moab, Let my father
and my mother, I pray thee, come
forth, and be with you, till I know
what God will do for me.
4 And he brought them before the
king of Moab: and they dwelt with
him all the while that David was
in the hold.
5 ¶ And the prophet a Gad said
unto David, Abide not in the hold;
depart, and get thee into the land
of Judah. Then David departed,
and came into the forest of Hareth.
6 ¶ When Saul heard that David
was discovered, and the men that
were with him, (now Saul a abode
in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah,
having his spear in his hand, and
all his servants were standing about
him;)
7 Then Saul said unto his servants
that stood about him, Hear now, ye
Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give
every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains

of thousands, and captains of
hundreds;
8 That all of you have a conspired
against me, and there is none that
sheweth me that my son hath made
a b league with the son of Jesse, and
there is none of you that is sorry for
me, or sheweth unto me that my son
hath stirred up my servant against
me, to lie in wait, as at this day ?
9 ¶ Then answered a  Doeg the
Edomite, which was set over the
servants of Saul, and said, I saw
the son of Jesse coming to b Nob, to
Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
10 And he inquired of the Lord
for him, and gave him a victuals,
and gave him the sword of Goliath
the Philistine.
11 Then the king sent to call
 Ahimelech the priest, the son of
Ahitub, and all his father’s house,
the priests that were in Nob: and
they came all of them to the king.
12 And Saul said, Hear now, thou
son of Ahitub. And he answered,
Here I am, my lord.
13 And Saul said unto him, Why
have ye conspired against me, thou
and the son of Jesse, in that thou
hast given him bread, and a sword,
and hast inquired of God for him,
that he should rise against me, to
lie in wait, as at this day ?
14 Then Ahimelech answered the
king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David,
which is the king’s son in law, and
goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?
15 Did I then begin to inquire of
God for him? be it far from me: let
not the king impute any thing unto
his servant, nor to all the house of
my father: for thy servant knew
nothing of all this, less or more.
16 And the king said, Thou shalt
surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and
all thy father’s house.
17 ¶ And the king said unto the

footmen that stood about him, Turn,
and slay the priests of the Lord;
because their hand also is with
David, and because they knew when
he fled, and did not shew it to me.
But the servants of the king would
not put forth their hand to fall upon
the priests of the Lord.
18 And the king said to Doeg, Turn
thou, and fall upon the priests. And
Doeg the Edomite turned, and he
fell upon the priests, and slew on
that day fourscore and five persons
that did wear a linen a ephod.
19 And Nob, the city of the priests,
smote he with the edge of the
sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and
asses, and sheep, with the edge of the
sword.
20 ¶ And one of the sons of Ahime­
lech the son of Ahitub, named
a 
Abiathar, escaped, and fled after
David.
21 And Abiathar shewed David
that Saul had slain the Lord’s
priests.
22 And David said unto Abiathar,
I knew it that day, when Doeg the
Edomite was there, that he would
surely tell Saul: I have occasioned
the death of all the persons of thy
father’s house.
23 Abide thou with me, fear not:
for he that seeketh my life seeketh
thy life: but with me thou shalt be
in safeguard.
Chapter 23
David smites the Philistines and saves
Keilah—He continues to flee from
Saul—Jonathan comforts him in Ziph.
Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against
a 
Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.
2 Therefore David a inquired of the
Lord, saying, Shall I go and smite
these Philistines? And the Lord

said unto David, Go, and smite the
Philistines, and save Keilah.
3 And David’s men said unto him,
Behold, we be afraid here in Judah:
how much more then if we come
to Keilah against the armies of the
Philistines?
4 Then David inquired of the Lord
yet again. And the Lord answered
him and said, Arise, go down to
Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.
5 So David and his men went to
Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and a smote them with a great
slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
6 And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to
David to Keilah, that he came down
with an ephod in his hand.
7 ¶ And it was told Saul that
David was come to Keilah. And Saul
said, God hath delivered him into
mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates
and bars.
8 And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah,
to besiege David and his men.
9 ¶ And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against
him; and he said to Abiathar the
priest, Bring hither the ephod.
10 Then said David, O Lord God
of Israel, thy servant hath certainly
heard that Saul seeketh to come
to Keilah, to destroy the city for
my sake.
11 Will the men of Keilah deliver
me up into his hand? will Saul come
down, as thy servant hath heard? O
Lord God of Israel, I beseech thee,
tell thy servant. And the Lord said,
He will come down.
12 Then said David, Will the men
of Keilah deliver me and my men
into the hand of Saul? And the Lord
said, They will deliver thee up.
13 ¶ Then David and his a men,
which were about six hundred, arose

and departed out of Keilah, and
went whithersoever they could go.
And it was told Saul that David
was escaped from Keilah; and he
forbare to go forth.
14 And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained
in a mountain in the wilderness of
Ziph. And Saul sought him every
day, but God delivered him not
into his hand.
15 And David saw that Saul was
come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph
in a a wood.
16 ¶ And a Jonathan Saul’s son
arose, and went to David into the
wood, and strengthened his hand
in God.
17 And he said unto him, Fear
not: for the hand of Saul my father
shall not find thee; and thou shalt
be king over Israel, and I shall be
next unto thee; and that also Saul
my father a knoweth.
18 And they two made a covenant
before the Lord: and David abode
in the wood, and Jonathan went to
his house.
19 ¶ Then came up the Ziphites
to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth
not David hide himself with us in
strong holds in the wood, in the hill
of Hachilah, which is on the south
of Jeshimon?
20 Now therefore, O king, come
down according to all the desire
of thy soul to come down; and our
part shall be to deliver him into the
king’s hand.
21 And Saul said, Blessed be ye of
the Lord; for ye have compassion
on me.
22 Go, I pray you, prepare yet,
and know and see his place where
a 
his haunt is, and who hath seen
him there: for it is told me that he
dealeth very subtilly.

will go with you: and it shall come
to pass, if he be in the land, that I
will search him out throughout all
the thousands of Judah.
24 And they arose, and went to
Ziph before Saul: but David and
his men were in the wilderness of
Maon, in the plain on the south of
Jeshimon.
25 Saul also and his men went
to seek him. And they told David:
wherefore he came down into a
rock, and abode in the wilderness
of Maon. And when Saul heard that,
he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
26 And Saul went on this side of
the mountain, and David and his
men on that side of the mountain:
and David made haste to get away
for fear of Saul; for Saul and his
men compassed David and his men
round about to take them.
27 ¶ But there came a messenger
unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and
come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.
28 Wherefore Saul returned from
pursuing after David, and went
against the Philistines: therefore they called that place a Selahammahlekoth.
29 ¶ And David went up from
thence, and dwelt in a strong holds
at En-gedi.
Chapter 24
David finds Saul in a cave and spares
his life—Saul confesses that David
is more righteous than he —David
swears that he will not cut off the seed
of Saul.
And it came to pass, when Saul was
returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying,
Behold, David is in the wilderness
of En-gedi.
2 Then Saul took three thousand

24	3	a	 or  sheepfolds; shelters,
probably caves with
stone walls about the

chosen men out of all Israel, and
went to seek David and his men
upon the rocks of the wild goats.
3 And he came to the a sheepcotes
by the way, where was a cave; and
Saul went in to cover his feet: and
David and his men remained in the
b 
sides of the cave.
4 And the men of David said unto
him, Behold the day of which the
Lord said unto thee, Behold, I will
deliver thine enemy into thine hand,
that thou mayest do to him as it
shall seem good unto thee. Then
David arose, and cut off the a skirt
of Saul’s robe b privily.
5 And it came to pass afterward,
that David’s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.
6 And he said unto his men, The
Lord forbid that I should do this
thing unto my master, the Lord’s
anointed, to stretch forth mine
hand against him, seeing he is the
a 
anointed of the Lord.
7 So David stayed his servants with
these words, and suffered them not
to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up
out of the cave, and went on his way.
8 David also arose afterward, and
went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king.
And when Saul looked behind him,
David stooped with his face to the
earth, and bowed himself.
9 ¶ And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men’s words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?
10 Behold, this day thine eyes
have seen how that the Lord had
delivered thee to day into mine
hand in the cave: and some bade me
kill thee: but mine eye a spared thee;
and I said, I will not put forth mine
hand against my lord; for he is the
b 
Lord’s anointed.

and see that there is neither evil nor

have not sinned against thee; yet
thou huntest my soul to take it.
12 The Lord a judge between me
and thee, and the Lord avenge me
of thee: but mine hand shall not
be upon thee.
13 As saith the proverb of the
ancients, a Wickedness proceedeth
from the wicked: but mine hand

14 After whom is the king of Israel
come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.
15 The Lord therefore be judge,
and judge between me and thee, and
see, and plead my cause, and deliver
me out of thine hand.
16 ¶ And it came to pass, when
David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul
said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice,
and wept.
17 And he said to David, Thou art
more righteous than I: for thou hast
rewarded me a good, whereas I have
rewarded thee evil.
18 And thou hast shewed this day
how that thou hast dealt well with
me: forasmuch as when the Lord
had delivered me into thine hand,
thou killedst me not.
19 For if a man find his enemy, will
he let him go well away ? wherefore
the Lord a reward thee good for that
thou hast done unto me this day.
20 And now, behold, I know well
that thou shalt surely be king, and
that the kingdom of Israel shall be
established in thine hand.
21 Swear now therefore unto me
by the Lord, that thou wilt not cut
off my seed after me, and that thou
wilt not destroy my name out of my
father’s house.

Saul went home; but David and his

Chapter 25
Samuel dies—Nabal rebuffs David and
refuses to give him food—Abigail intercedes, saves Nabal, and gives David a
present—David is pacified, Nabal dies,
and David marries Abigail.
And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and
lamented him, and buried him in
his house at Ramah. And David
arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
2 And there was a man in Maon,
whose possessions were in Carmel;
and the man was very great, and
he had three thousand sheep, and
a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
3 Now the name of the man was
Nabal; and the name of his wife
Abigail: and she was a woman of
good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was
a 
churlish and evil in his doings; and
he was of the house of Caleb.
4 ¶ And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his
sheep.
5 And David sent out ten young
men, and David said unto the young
men, Get you up to Carmel, and go
to Nabal, and greet him in my name:
6 And thus shall ye say to him that
liveth in prosperity, a Peace be both to
thee, and b peace be to thine house,
and peace be unto all that thou hast.
7 And now I have heard that thou
hast shearers: now thy shepherds
which were with us, we hurt them
not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they
were in Carmel.
8 Ask thy young men, and they will
shew thee. Wherefore let the young
men find favour in thine eyes: for
we come in a good day: give, I pray
thee, whatsoever cometh to thine
hand unto thy servants, and to thy
son David.
9 And when David’s young men

Alma 58:6;
3 Ne. 4:1.
25	3	a	 or  rude, rough, “hard.”

came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name
of David, and ceased.
10 ¶ And Nabal answered David’s
servants, and said, Who is David?
and who is the son of Jesse? there
be many servants now a days that
break away every man from his
master.
11 Shall I then take my bread,
and my water, and my flesh that
I have killed for my shearers, and
give it unto men, whom I know not
whence they be?
12 So David’s young men turned
their way, and went again, and came
and told him all those sayings.
13 And David said unto his men,
Gird ye on every man his sword.
And they girded on every man his
sword; and David also girded on his
sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and
two hundred abode by the stuff.
14 ¶ But one of the young men
told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying,
Behold, David sent messengers out
of the wilderness to a salute our master; and he b railed on them.
15 But the men were very good unto
us, and we were not hurt, neither
missed we any thing, as long as we
were conversant with them, when
we were in the fields:
16 They were a wall unto us both
by night and day, all the while we
were with them keeping the sheep.
17 Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil
is determined against our master,
and against all his household: for
he is such a son of Belial, that a man
cannot speak to him.
18 ¶ Then Abigail made haste,
and took two hundred loaves, and
two bottles of wine, and five sheep
ready dressed, and five measures
of parched corn, and an hundred
clusters of raisins, and two hundred
cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.
	14	a	 heb  bless or greet.
		b	 heb  swooped upon
(as a bird attacking).
	20	a	 or  concealed by the
hill.

19 And she said unto her servants,
Go on before me; behold, I come
after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.
20 And it was so, as she rode on
the ass, that she came down a by the
covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against
her; and she met them.
21 Now David had said, Surely in
vain have I kept all that this fellow
hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained
unto him: and he hath a requited
me evil for good.
22 So and more also do God unto
the enemies of David, if I leave of
all that pertain to him by the morning light a any that pisseth against
the wall.
23 And when Abigail saw David,
she hasted, and lighted off the ass,
and fell before David on her face, and
bowed herself to the ground,
24 And fell at his feet, and said,
Upon me, my lord, upon me let this
iniquity be: and let thine handmaid,
I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine
handmaid.
25 Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even a Nabal:
for as his name is, so is he; Nabal
is his name, and folly is with him:
but I thine handmaid saw not the
young men of my lord, whom thou
didst send.
26 Now therefore, my lord, as the
Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth,
seeing the Lord hath withholden
thee from coming to shed blood, and
from avenging thyself with thine
own hand, now let thine enemies,
and they that seek evil to my lord,
be as Nabal.
27 And now this blessing which
thine handmaid hath brought unto
my lord, let it even be given unto
the young men that follow my lord.
28 I pray thee, forgive the trespass

	21	a	 or  returned.
	22	a	 What follows is a
derisive term for “any

of thine handmaid: for the Lord
will certainly make my lord a a sure
b 
house; because my lord fighteth the
battles of the Lord, and evil hath
not been found in thee all thy days.
29 Yet a man is risen to pursue
thee, and to seek thy soul: but the
soul of my lord shall be bound in
the bundle of life with the Lord
thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as
out of the middle of a sling.
30 And it shall come to pass, when
the Lord shall have done to my
lord according to all the good that
he hath spoken concerning thee,
and shall have appointed thee ruler
over Israel;
31 That this shall be no grief unto
thee, nor offence of heart unto my
lord, either that thou hast shed
blood causeless, or that my lord hath
avenged himself: but when the Lord
shall have dealt well with my lord,
then remember thine handmaid.
32 ¶ And David said to Abigail,
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,
which sent thee this day to meet me:
33 And blessed be thy advice, and
blessed be thou, which hast kept
me this day from coming to shed
blood, and from avenging myself
with mine own hand.
34 For in very deed, as the Lord
God of Israel liveth, which hath kept
me back from hurting thee, except
thou hadst hasted and come to meet
me, surely there had not been left
unto Nabal by the morning light
any that pisseth against the wall.
35 So David received of her hand
that which she had brought him,
and said unto her, Go up in peace to
thine house; see, I have hearkened
to thy voice, and have accepted
thy person.
36 ¶ And Abigail came to Nabal;
and, behold, he held a feast in his
house, like the feast of a king; and
Nabal’s heart was merry within him,
	28	a	 or  firm house;
an assurance of
descendants.
		b	 1 Sam. 2:35.

for he was very drunken: wherefore
she told him nothing, less or more,
until the morning light.
37 But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out
of Nabal, and his wife had told
him these things, that his heart
died within him, and he became
as a stone.
38 And it came to pass about ten
days after, that the Lord a smote
Nabal, that he died.
39 ¶ And when David heard that
Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed
be the Lord, that hath pleaded the
cause of my reproach from the
hand of Nabal, and hath kept his
servant from evil: for the Lord hath
returned the wickedness of Nabal
upon his own head. And David sent
and communed with Abigail, to
take her to him to wife.
40 And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel,
they spake unto her, saying, David
sent us unto thee, to take thee to
him to wife.
41 And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and
said, Behold, let thine handmaid
be a servant to wash the feet of the
servants of my lord.
42 And Abigail hasted, and arose,
and rode upon an ass, with five
damsels of hers that went after her;
and she went after the messengers
of David, and became his wife.
43 David also took a Ahinoam of
Jezreel; and they were also both of
them his b wives.
44 ¶ But Saul had given Michal his
daughter, David’s wife, to a Phalti the
son of Laish, which was of Gallim.

And the Ziphites came unto Saul
to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David
hide himself in the hill of Hachilah,
which is before Jeshimon?
2 Then Saul arose, and went down
to the wilderness of Ziph, having
three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the
wilderness of Ziph.
3 And Saul pitched in the hill
of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David
abode in the wilderness, and he saw
that Saul came after him into the
wilderness.
4 David therefore sent out spies,
and understood that Saul was come
in very deed.
5 ¶ And David arose, and came to
the place where Saul had pitched:
and David beheld the place where
Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner,
the captain of his host: and Saul
lay in the a trench, and the people
pitched round about him.
6 Then answered David and said
to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to
Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother
to Joab, saying, Who will go down
with me to Saul to the camp? And
a 
Abishai said, I will go down with
thee.
7 So David and Abishai came to
the people by night: and, behold,
Saul lay sleeping within the trench,
and his spear stuck in the ground
at a his bolster: but Abner and the
people lay round about him.
8 Then said Abishai to David, God
hath delivered thine enemy into
thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee,
with the spear even to the earth at
once, and I will not smite him the
second time.
9 And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for a who can stretch
forth his hand against the Lord’s
anointed, and be guiltless?
10 David said furthermore, As the
Lord liveth, the Lord shall smite
him; or his day shall come to a die;

or he shall descend into battle, and

11 The Lord forbid that I should
stretch forth mine hand against the
Lord’s anointed: but, I pray thee,
take thou now the spear that is at
his bolster, and the cruse of water,
and let us go.
12 So David took the spear and
the cruse of water from Saul’s bolster; and they gat them away, and
no man saw it, nor knew it, neither
awaked: for they were all asleep; because a a deep sleep from the Lord
was fallen upon them.
13 ¶ Then David went over to the
other side, and stood on the top of
an hill afar off; a great space being
between them:
14 And David cried to the people,
and to Abner the son of Ner, saying,
Answerest thou not, Abner? Then
Abner answered and said, Who art
thou that criest to the king?
15 And David said to Abner, Art
not thou a valiant man? and who
is like to thee in Israel? wherefore
then hast thou not kept thy lord the
king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.
16 This thing is not good that thou
hast done. As the Lord liveth, ye
are worthy to die, because ye have
not kept your master, the Lord’s
anointed. And now see where the
king’s spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.
17 And Saul knew David’s voice,
and said, Is this thy voice, my son
David? And David said, It is my
voice, my lord, O king.
18 And he said, Wherefore doth my
lord thus pursue after his servant?
for what have I done? or what evil
is in mine hand?
19 Now therefore, I pray thee, let
my lord the king hear the words of
his servant. If the Lord have stirred
thee up against me, let him accept
an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before
the Lord; for they have driven me

out this day from abiding in the
inheritance of the Lord, saying,
Go, serve other gods.
20 Now therefore, let not my blood
fall to the earth before the face of the
Lord: for the king of Israel is come
out to seek a flea, as when one doth
hunt a partridge in the mountains.
21 ¶ Then said Saul, I have sinned:
return, my son David: for I will no
more do thee harm, because my
soul was a precious in thine eyes
this day: behold, I have played the
fool, and have erred exceedingly.
22 And David answered and said,
Behold the king’s spear! and let
one of the young men come over
and fetch it.
23 The Lord render to every man
his a righteousness and his faithfulness: for the Lord delivered thee
into my hand to day, but I would
not stretch forth mine hand b against
the Lord’s anointed.
24 And, behold, as thy life was
much set by this day in mine eyes,
so let my life be much set by in
the eyes of the Lord, and let him
deliver me out of all a tribulation.
25 Then Saul said to David, Blessed
be thou, my son David: thou shalt
both do great things, and also shalt
still prevail. So David went on his
way, and Saul returned to his place.

David flees to Achish at Gath—He
dwells among the Philistines for sixteen months.
And David said in his heart, I shall
now perish one day by the hand of
Saul: there is nothing better for me
than that I should speedily escape
into the land of the Philistines; and
Saul shall despair of me, to seek me
any more in any coast of Israel: so
shall I escape out of his hand.

were with him unto b  Achish, the son

with his two a wives, Ahinoam the
Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s wife.
4 And it was told Saul that David
was fled to Gath: and he sought no
more again for him.
5 ¶ And David said unto Achish,
If I have now found grace in thine
eyes, let them give me a place in
some town in the country, that I
may dwell there: for why should
thy servant dwell in the royal city
with thee?
6 Then Achish gave him Ziklag
that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah
unto this day.
7 And the time that David dwelt
in the country of the Philistines
was a full year and four months.
8 ¶ And David and his men went
up, and invaded the Geshurites, and
the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for
those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to
Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.
9 And David smote the land, and
left neither man nor woman alive,
and took away the sheep, and the
oxen, and the asses, and the camels,
and the apparel, and returned, and
came to Achish.
10 And Achish said, Whither have
ye made a a road to day ? And David
said, Against the south of Judah,
and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of
the Kenites.
11 And David saved neither man
nor woman alive, to bring tidings to
Gath, saying, Lest they should tell
on us, saying, So did David, and
so will be his manner all the while
he dwelleth in the country of the
Philistines.

Chapter 28
Saul inquires of the witch of Endor for
revelation—She foretells his death, the
death of his sons, and the defeat of Israel by the Philistines.
And it came to pass in those days,
that the Philistines gathered their
armies together for warfare, to fight
with Israel. And Achish said unto
David, Know thou assuredly, that
thou shalt go out with me to battle,
thou and thy men.
2 And David said to Achish, Surely
thou shalt know what thy servant
can do. And Achish said to David,
Therefore will I make thee a keeper
of mine head for ever.
3 ¶ Now Samuel was dead, and all
Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own
city. And Saul had a put away those
that had b familiar spirits, and the
wizards, out of the land.
4 And the Philistines gathered
themselves together, and came and
pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they
pitched in Gilboa.
5 And when Saul saw the host of
the Philistines, he was afraid, and
his heart greatly trembled.
6 And when Saul inquired of the
Lord, the Lord a answered him not,
neither by b dreams, nor by c Urim,
nor by prophets.
7 ¶ Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath
a a familiar spirit, that I may go to
her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a
woman that hath a familiar spirit
at En-dor.
8 And Saul disguised himself, and
put on other raiment, and he went,
and two men with him, and they
came to the woman by night: and

thee.
9 And the woman said unto him,
Behold, thou knowest what Saul
hath done, how he hath cut off those
that have familiar spirits, and the
wizards, out of the land: wherefore
then layest thou a snare for my life,
to cause me to die?
10 And Saul sware to her by the
Lord, saying, As the Lord liveth,
there shall no punishment happen
to thee for this thing.
11 Then said the woman, Whom
shall I bring up unto thee? And he
said, Bring me up Samuel.
12 And when the woman saw Sam­
uel, she cried with a loud voice: and
the woman spake to Saul, saying,
Why hast thou deceived me? for
thou art Saul.
13 And the king said unto her, Be
not afraid: for what sawest thou?
And the woman said unto Saul,
I saw gods ascending out of the
earth.
14 And he said unto her, What
form is he of? And she said, a An old
man cometh up; and he is covered
with a mantle. And Saul perceived
that it was Samuel, and he stooped
with his face to the ground, and
bowed himself.
15 ¶ And Samuel said to Saul,
Why hast thou disquieted me, to
bring me up? And Saul answered,
I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and
God is a departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by
prophets, nor by dreams: therefore
I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I
shall do.

then dost thou ask of me, seeing the
Lord is departed from thee, and is
become thine enemy ?
17 And the Lord hath done to
him, as he spake by me: for the
Lord hath rent the a kingdom out
of thine hand, and given it to thy
neighbour, even to David:
18 Because thou a obeyedst not
the voice of the Lord, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek,
therefore hath the Lord done this
thing unto thee this day.
19 Moreover the Lord will also
deliver Israel with thee into the
hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with
me: the Lord also shall deliver the
host of Israel into the hand of the
Philistines.
20 Then a Saul fell straightway all
along on the earth, and was sore
afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in
him; for he had eaten no bread all
the day, nor all the night.
21 ¶ And the woman came unto
Saul, and saw that he was sore
troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed
thy voice, and I have put my life
in my hand, and have hearkened
unto thy words which thou spakest
unto me.
22 Now therefore, I pray thee,
hearken thou also unto the voice
of thine handmaid, and let me set
a morsel of bread before thee; and
eat, that thou mayest have strength,
when thou goest on thy way.
23 But he refused, and said, I will
not eat. But his servants, together
with the woman, compelled him;
and he hearkened unto their voice.
So he arose from the earth, and sat
upon the bed.
24 And the woman had a fat calf in
the house; and she hasted, and killed
it, and took flour, and kneaded it,

Chapter 29
Israel and the Philistines gather for
war—The Philistine princes send David away.
Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and
the Israelites pitched by a a fountain
which is in Jezreel.
2 And the lords of the Philistines
passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed
on a in the rearward with Achish.
3 Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here?
And Achish said unto the princes
of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king
of Israel, which hath been with
me these days, or these years, and
I have found no fault in him since
he fell unto me unto this day ?
4 And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and
the princes of the Philistines said
unto him, Make this fellow return,
that he may go again to his place
which thou hast appointed him,
and let him not go down with us
to battle, lest in the battle he be
an a adversary to us: for wherewith
should he b reconcile himself unto
his master? should it not be with the
heads of these men?
5 Is not this David, of whom they
sang one to another in dances, saying, a Saul slew his thousands, and
David his ten thousands?
6 ¶ Then Achish called David, and
said unto him, Surely, as the Lord
liveth, thou hast been upright, and
thy going out and thy coming in
with me in the host is good in my
sight: for I have not found evil in
thee since the day of thy coming
unto me unto this day: nevertheless
the lords favour thee not.

peace, that thou displease not the
lords of the Philistines.
8 ¶ And David said unto Achish,
But what have I done? and what
hast thou found in thy servant so
long as I have been with thee unto
this day, that I may not go fight
against the enemies of my lord the
king?
9 And Achish answered and said
to David, I know that thou art good
in my sight, as an a angel of God:
notwithstanding the princes of the
Philistines have said, He shall not
go up with us to the battle.
10 Wherefore now rise up early
in the morning with thy master’s
servants that are come with thee:
and as soon as ye be up early in the
morning, and have light, depart.
11 So David and his men rose up
early to depart in the morning, to
return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up
to Jezreel.
Chapter 30
The Amalekites spoil Ziklag and the
borders of Judah—David smites Amalek and regains and divides the spoil.
And it came to pass, when David
and his men were come to Ziklag on
the third day, that the Amalekites
had invaded the south, and Ziklag,
and smitten Ziklag, and burned it
with fire;
2 And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew
not any, either great or small, but
carried them away, and went on
their way.
3 ¶ So David and his men came to
the city, and, behold, it was burned
with fire; and their wives, and their
sons, and their daughters, were
taken captives.
4 Then David and the people that
were with him lifted up their voice
and wept, until they had no more
power to weep.
5 And David’s two a wives were
taken captives, Ahinoam the Jez	9	a	 tg  Angels.

reelitess, and Abigail the wife of
Nabal the Carmelite.
6 And David was greatly distressed;
for the people spake of stoning
him, because the soul of all the
people was grieved, every man for
his sons and for his daughters: but
David a encouraged himself in the
Lord his God.
7 And David said to Abiathar
the priest, Ahimelech’s son, I pray
thee, bring me hither the ephod.
And Abiathar brought thither the
ephod to David.
8 And David inquired at the Lord,
saying, Shall I pursue after this
troop? shall I overtake them? And
he answered him, Pursue: for thou
shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.
9 So David went, he and the six
hundred men that were with him,
and came to the brook Besor, where
those that were left behind stayed.
10 But David pursued, he and
four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so
faint that they could not go over
the brook Besor.
11 ¶ And they found an Egyptian
in the field, and brought him to
David, and gave him bread, and he
did eat; and they made him drink
water;
12 And they gave him a piece of
a cake of figs, and two clusters of
raisins: and when he had eaten,
his spirit came again to him: for he
had eaten no bread, nor drunk any
water, three days and three nights.
13 And David said unto him, To
whom belongest thou? and whence
art thou? And he said, I am a young
man of Egypt, servant to an Amalek­
ite; and my master left me, because
three days agone I fell sick.
14 We made an invasion upon the
south of the a Cherethites, and upon
the coast which belongeth to Judah,
and upon the south of Caleb; and
we burned Ziklag with fire.
15 And David said to him, Canst thou
bring me down to this company ?

And he said, Swear unto me by God,
that thou wilt neither kill me, nor
deliver me into the hands of my
a 
master, and I will bring thee down
to this company.
16 ¶ And when he had brought
him down, behold, they were spread
abroad upon all the earth, eating
and drinking, and dancing, because
of all the great spoil that they had
taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of
Judah.
17 And David smote them from
the twilight even unto the evening
of the next day: and there escaped
not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon
camels, and fled.
18 And David recovered all that
the a Amalekites had carried away:
and David rescued his two wives.
19 And there was nothing lacking
to them, neither small nor great,
neither sons nor daughters, neither
spoil, nor any thing that they had
taken to them: David recovered all.
20 And David took all the flocks
and the herds, which they drave
before those other cattle, and said,
This is David’s spoil.
21 ¶ And David came to the two
hundred men, which were so faint
that they could not follow David,
whom they had made also to abide
at the brook Besor: and they went
forth to meet David, and to meet
the people that were with him: and
when David came near to the people, he saluted them.
22 Then answered all the wicked
men and men of Belial, of those that
went with David, and said, Because
they went not with us, we will not
give them ought of the spoil that we
have recovered, save to every man
his wife and his children, that they
may lead them away, and depart.
23 Then said David, Ye shall not
do so, my brethren, with that which
the Lord hath given us, who hath
preserved us, and delivered the

stuff: they a shall part alike.
25 And it was so from that day
forward, that he made it a statute
and an ordinance for Israel unto
this day.
26 ¶ And when David came to
Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the
elders of Judah, even to his friends,
saying, Behold a present for you of
the spoil of the enemies of the Lord;
27 To them which were in Beth-el,
and to them which were in south
Ramoth, and to them which were
in Jattir,
28 And to them which were in
Aroer, and to them which were in
Siphmoth, and to them which were
in Eshtemoa,
29 And to them which were in
Rachal, and to them which were in
the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and
to them which were in the cities of
the Kenites,
30 And to them which were in
Hormah, and to them which were
in Chor-ashan, and to them which
were in Athach,
31 And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where
David himself and his men a were
wont to haunt.
Chapter 31
The Philistines defeat Israel—Saul and
his three sons are slain—Their bodies are
retrieved by the Gileadites and burned.
Now the a Philistines fought against
Israel: and the men of Israel fled
from before the Philistines, and fell
down slain in mount Gilboa.

hard upon Saul and upon his sons;
and the Philistines slew Jonathan,

3 And the battle went sore against
Saul, and the archers hit him; and
he was sore wounded of the archers.
4 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust
me through therewith; lest these
uncircumcised come and thrust me
through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was
sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a
sword, and a fell upon it.
5 And when his armourbearer saw
that a Saul was dead, he fell likewise
upon his sword, and died with him.
6 So Saul died, and his three sons,
and his armourbearer, and all his
men, that same day together.
7 ¶ And when the men of Israel
that were on the other side of the
valley, and they that were on the
other side Jordan, saw that the men
of Israel fled, and that Saul and his
sons were dead, they forsook the
cities, and fled; and the Philistines
came and dwelt in them.

8 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to
strip the slain, that they found Saul
and his three sons fallen in mount
Gilboa.
9 And they cut off his head, and
stripped off his armour, and sent
into the land of the Philistines round
about, to publish it in the house of
their idols, and among the people.
10 And they put his armour in
the house of Ashtaroth: and they
fastened his a body to the wall of
Beth-shan.

Jabesh-gilead heard of that which
the Philistines had done to Saul;
12 All the valiant men arose, and
went all night, and took the body of
Saul and the bodies of his sons from
the wall of Beth-shan, and came to
Jabesh, and burnt them there.
13 And they took their bones, and
buried them under a tree at Jabesh,
and fasted seven days.

went the matter? I pray thee, tell
me. And he answered, That the
people are fled from the battle, and
many of the people also are fallen
and dead; and Saul and Jonathan
his son are dead also.
5 And David said unto the young
man that told him, How knowest
thou that Saul and Jonathan his
son be dead?
6 And the young man that told
him said, As I happened by chance
upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul
leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the
chariots and horsemen followed
hard after him.
7 And when he looked behind him,
he saw me, and called unto me. And
I answered, Here am I.
8 And he said unto me, Who art
thou? And I answered him, I am an
Amalekite.
9 He said unto me again, Stand, I
pray thee, upon me, and slay me:
for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.
10 So I stood upon him, and a slew
him, because I was sure that he could
not live after that he was fallen:
and I took the crown that was upon
his head, and the bracelet that
was on his arm, and have brought
them hither unto my lord.
11 Then David took hold on his
clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:
12 And they mourned, and wept,
and fasted until even, for Saul, and
for Jonathan his son, and for the
people of the Lord, and for the
house of Israel; because they were
fallen by the sword.

young man that told him, Whence
art thou? And he answered, I am

mouth hath testified against thee,
saying, I have slain the Lord’s

17 ¶ And David lamented with
this lamentation over Saul and over
Jonathan his son:
18 (Also he bade them a teach the
children of Judah the use of the bow:
behold, it is written in the book of

Chapter 2
David is anointed king over the house
of Judah—Ishbosheth becomes the king
of Israel—David’s followers defeat Abner and the men of Israel.
And it came to pass after this, that
David inquired of the Lord, saying,
Shall I go up into any of the cities
of Judah? And the Lord said unto
him, Go up. And David said, Whither
shall I go up? And he said, Unto
Hebron.
2 So David went up thither, and
his two a wives also, Ahinoam the
Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal’s
wife the Carmelite.
3 And his a men that were with him
did David bring up, every man with
his household: and they dwelt in
the cities of Hebron.
4 And the men of Judah came,
and there they anointed a David
king over the house of b Judah. And
they told David, saying, That the
men of c Jabesh-gilead were they that
buried Saul.
5 ¶ And David sent messengers
unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and
said unto them, Blessed be ye of
the Lord, that ye have shewed this
kindness unto your lord, even unto
Saul, and have buried him.
6 And now the Lord shew kindness
and truth unto you: and I also will
a 
requite you this kindness, because
ye have done this thing.
7 Therefore now let your hands be

him over to Mahanaim;
9 And made him king over Gilead,
and over the Ashurites, and over
Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over
Benjamin, and over all Israel.
10 Ish-bosheth Saul’s son was forty
years old when he began to reign over
Israel, and reigned two years. But
the house of Judah followed David.
11 And the time that David was
a 
king in Hebron over the house
of b Judah was seven years and six
months.
12 ¶ And Abner the son of Ner, and
the servants of Ish-bosheth the son
of Saul, went out from Mahanaim
to Gibeon.
13 And Joab the son of Zeruiah,
and the servants of David, went
out, and met together by the pool of
Gibeon: and they sat down, the one
on the one side of the pool, and the
other on the other side of the pool.
14 And Abner said to Joab, Let the
young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.
15 Then there arose and went over
by number twelve of Benjamin,
which pertained to Ish-bosheth the
son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
16 And they caught every one his
fellow by the head, and thrust his
sword in his fellow’s side; so they
fell down together: wherefore that
place was called a Helkath-hazzurim,

and the men of Israel, before the

and in going he turned not to the
right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
20 Then Abner looked behind him,
and said, Art thou Asahel? And he
answered, I am.
21 And Abner said to him, Turn
thee aside to thy right hand or to
thy left, and lay thee hold on one
of the young men, and take thee
his armour. But Asahel would not
turn aside from following of him.
22 And Abner said again to Asahel,
Turn thee aside from following me:
wherefore should I smite thee to the
ground? how then should I hold up
my face to Joab thy brother?
23 Howbeit he refused to turn aside:
wherefore Abner with the hinder
end of the spear smote him under
the a fifth rib, that the spear came
out behind him; and he fell down
there, and died in the same place:
and it came to pass, that as many
as came to the place where b Asahel
fell down and died stood still.
24 Joab also and Abishai pursued
after Abner: and the sun went down
when they were come to the hill of
Ammah, that lieth before Giah by
the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
25 ¶ And the children of Benjamin
gathered themselves together after
Abner, and became one troop, and
stood on the top of an hill.
26 Then Abner called to Joab, and
said, Shall the sword devour for
ever? knowest thou not that it will
be bitterness in the latter end? how
long shall it be then, ere thou bid
the people return from following
their brethren?
27 And Joab said, As God liveth,
unless thou hadst spoken, surely
then in the morning the people had
gone up every one from following
his brother.
28 So Joab blew a trumpet, and all
the people stood still, and pursued
after Israel no more, neither fought
they any more.

through all Bithron, and they came
to Mahanaim.
30 And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there
lacked of David’s servants nineteen
men and Asahel.
31 But the servants of David had
smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner’s men, so that three hundred
and threescore men died.
32 ¶ And they took up Asahel, and
buried him in the sepulchre of his
father, which was in Beth-lehem.
And Joab and his men went all
night, and they came to Hebron at
break of day.
Chapter 3
The houses of David and Saul engage
in a long war—David grows stronger—Abner joins David but is slain by
Joab—David mourns for Abner.
Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the
house of David: but David waxed
stronger and stronger, and the
house of Saul waxed weaker and
weaker.
2 ¶ And unto a David were sons
born in Hebron: and his firstborn
was Amnon, of b Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;

made himself strong for the house
of Saul.
7 And Saul had a concubine, whose
name was a Rizpah, the daughter of
Aiah: and Ish-bosheth said to Abner,
Wherefore hast thou gone in unto
my father’s concubine?
8 Then was Abner very wroth for
the words of Ish-bosheth, and said,
Am I a a dog’s head, which against
Judah do shew kindness this day
unto the house of Saul thy father,
to his brethren, and to his friends,
and have not delivered thee into the
hand of David, that thou chargest
me to day with a fault concerning
this woman?
9 So do God to Abner, and more
also, except, as the Lord hath sworn
to a David, even so I do to him;
10 To a translate the kingdom from
the house of Saul, and to set up the
throne of David over Israel and
over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.
11 And he could not answer Abner
a word again, because he feared him.
12 ¶ And Abner sent messengers to
David on his behalf, saying, Whose
is the land? saying also, Make thy
a 
league with me, and, behold, my
hand shall be with thee, to bring
about all Israel unto thee.
13 ¶ And he said, Well; I will make
a league with thee: but one thing I
require of thee, that is, Thou shalt
not see my face, except thou first
bring Michal Saul’s daughter, when
thou comest to see my face.
14 And David sent messengers to
Ish-bosheth Saul’s son, saying, Deliver me my wife a Michal, which
I espoused to me for an hundred

15 And Ish-bosheth sent, and took
her from her husband, even from
a 
Phaltiel the son of Laish.
16 And her husband went with
her along weeping behind her to
Bahurim. Then said Abner unto
him, Go, return. And he returned.
17 ¶ And Abner had communica	7	a	 2 Sam. 21:8 (8, 10).

tion with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times
past to be king over you:
18 Now then do it: for the Lord
hath spoken of David, saying, By
the hand of my servant David I will
save my people Israel out of the
hand of the Philistines, and out of
the hand of all their enemies.
19 And Abner also spake in the
ears of Benjamin: and Abner went
also to speak in the ears of David
in Hebron all that seemed good to
Israel, and that seemed good to the
whole house of Benjamin.
20 So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him.
And David made Abner and the
men that were with him a feast.
21 And Abner said unto David, I
will arise and go, and will gather
all Israel unto my lord the king,
that they may make a league with
thee, and that thou mayest reign
over all that thine heart desireth.
And David sent Abner away; and
he went in peace.
22 ¶ And, behold, the servants of
David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great
spoil with them: but Abner was not
with David in Hebron; for he had
sent him away, and he was gone in
peace.
23 When Joab and all the host that
was with him were come, they told
Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner
came to the king, and he hath sent
him away, and he is gone in peace.
24 Then Joab came to the king,
and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why
is it that thou hast sent him away,
and he is quite gone?
25 Thou knowest Abner the son of
Ner, that he came to deceive thee,
and to know thy going out and thy
coming in, and to know all that
thou doest.
26 And when Joab was come out
from David, he sent messengers
after Abner, which brought him

again from the well of Sirah: but
David knew it not.
27 And when a Abner was returned
to Hebron, Joab took him aside in
the gate to speak with him quietly,
and smote him there under the fifth
rib, that he died, for the blood of
b 
Asahel his brother.
28 ¶ And afterward when David
heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the Lord
for ever from the blood of Abner
the son of Ner:
29 Let it rest on the head of a Joab,
and on all his father’s house; and
let there not fail from the house
of Joab one that hath an issue, or
that is a leper, or that leaneth on a
staff, or that falleth on the sword,
or that lacketh bread.
30 So Joab and Abishai his brother
slew Abner, because he had slain
their brother Asahel at Gibeon in
the battle.
31 ¶ And David said to Joab, and
to all the people that were with
him, Rend your clothes, and gird
you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself
followed the bier.
32 And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his
voice, and wept at the grave of
Abner; and all the people wept.
33 And the king lamented over
Abner, and said, Died Abner as a
fool dieth?
34 Thy hands were not bound, nor
thy feet put into fetters: as a man
falleth before wicked men, so fellest
thou. And all the people wept again
over him.
35 And when all the people came
to cause David to eat meat while it
was yet day, David sware, saying,
So do God to me, and more also, if
I taste bread, or ought else, till the
sun be down.
36 And all the people took notice
of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the
people.

37 For all the people and all Israel
understood that day that it was not
of the king to slay Abner the son
of Ner.
38 And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a
prince and a great man fallen this
day in Israel?
39 And I am this day weak, though
anointed king; and these men the
sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me:
the Lord shall a reward the doer of
evil according to his wickedness.
Chapter 4
Two of Saul’s captains slay Ishbosheth—They take his head to David, who
has them slain for killing a righteous
person.
And when Saul’s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands
were feeble, and all the Israelites
were troubled.
2 And Saul’s son had two men that
were captains of bands: the name of
the one was Baanah, and the name
of the other Rechab, the sons of
Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also
was reckoned to Benjamin:
3 And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were a sojourners there
until this day.)
4 And a Jonathan, Saul’s son, had
a son that was lame of his feet. He
was five years old when the tidings
came of Saul and Jonathan out of
Jezreel, and his nurse took him up,
and fled: and it came to pass, as she
made haste to flee, that he fell, and
became lame. And his name was
Mephibosheth.
5 And the sons of Rimmon the
Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah,
went, and came about the heat of
the day to the house of Ish-bosheth,
who lay on a bed at noon.
6 And they came thither into the
midst of the house, as though they
would have fetched wheat; and they
smote him under the fifth rib: and

Rechab and Baanah his brother
escaped.
7 For when they came into the
house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and
slew him, and beheaded him, and
took his head, and gat them away
through the plain all night.
8 And they brought the head of
Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron,
and said to the king, Behold the
head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul
thine enemy, which sought thy life;
and the Lord hath avenged my
lord the king this day of Saul, and
of his seed.
9 ¶ And David answered Rechab
and Baanah his brother, the sons of
Rimmon the Beerothite, and said
unto them, As the Lord liveth, who
hath redeemed my soul out of all
adversity,
10 When one told me, saying, Behold, a Saul is b dead, thinking to have
brought good tidings, I took hold of
him, and slew him in Ziklag, who
thought that I would have given him
a reward for his tidings:
11 How much more, when wicked
men have slain a righteous person
in his own house upon his bed?
shall I not therefore now require
his blood of your hand, and take
you away from the earth?
12 And David commanded his
young men, and they slew them,
and cut off their hands and their
feet, and hanged them up over the
pool in Hebron. But they took the
head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in
the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.

to a David unto Hebron, and spake,
saying, Behold, we are thy bone
and thy flesh.
2 Also in time past, when Saul was
king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel:
and the Lord said to thee, Thou
shalt feed my people Israel, and
thou shalt be a captain over Israel.
3 So all the elders of Israel came
to the king to Hebron; and king
David made a league with them in
Hebron before the Lord: and they
a 
anointed b David c king over Israel.
4 ¶ David was thirty years old
when he began to a reign, and he
b 
reigned forty years.
5 In Hebron he reigned over a Judah seven years and six months:
and in Jerusalem he b reigned thirty
and three years over all Israel and
Judah.
6 ¶ And the king and his men
went to Jerusalem unto the a Jebus­
ites, the inhabitants of the land:
which spake unto David, saying,
Except thou take away the blind
and the lame, thou shalt not come
in hither: thinking, David cannot
come in hither.
7 Nevertheless David took the
strong hold of a Zion: the same is
the b city of David.
8 And David said on that day,
Whosoever getteth up to the gutter,
and smiteth the a Jebusites, and the
lame and the blind, that are hated
of David’s soul, he shall be chief and
captain. Wherefore they said, The
blind and the lame shall not come
into the house.
9 So David dwelt in the fort, and
called it the a city of David. And
David built round about from
b 
Millo and inward.
10 And David went on, and grew
great, and the Lord God of hosts
was with him.

11 ¶ And a Hiram king of Tyre sent
messengers to David, and cedar
trees, and carpenters, and masons:
and they built David an house.
12 And David perceived that the
Lord had established him king over
Israel, and that he had exalted his
kingdom for his people Israel’s sake.
13 ¶ And David took him more
concubines and a wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from
Hebron: and there were yet b sons
and daughters born to David.
14 And these be the names of those
that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, and
Nathan, and Solomon,
15 Ibhar also, and Elishua, and
Nepheg, and Japhia,
16 And Elishama, and Eliada, and
Eliphalet.
17 ¶ But when the Philistines
heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and
David heard of it, and went down
to the a hold.
18 The Philistines also came and
spread themselves in the valley of
Rephaim.
19 And David inquired of the
Lord, saying, Shall I go up to the
Philistines? wilt thou deliver them
into mine hand? And the Lord
said unto David, Go up: for I will
doubtless deliver the Philistines
into thine hand.
20 And David came to a  Baalperazim, and David smote them
there, and said, The Lord hath
broken forth upon mine enemies
before me, as the b breach of waters. Therefore he called the name
of that place Baal-perazim.
21 And there they left their a images, and David and his men b burned
them.

yet again, and spread themselves in
the valley of Rephaim.
23 And when David inquired of
the Lord, he said, Thou shalt not
go up; but fetch a compass behind
them, and come upon them over
against the mulberry trees.
24 And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops
of the mulberry trees, that then
thou shalt bestir thyself: for then
shall the Lord go out before thee,
to smite the host of the Philistines.
25 And David did so, as the Lord
had commanded him; and smote
the a Philistines from Geba until
thou come to Gazer.

David takes the ark to the city of David—Uzzah is smitten for steadying the
ark and dies—David dances before the
Lord, causing a breach between him
and Michal.
Again, David a gathered together
all the chosen men of Israel, thirty
thousand.
2 And David arose, and went with
all the people that were with him
from Baale of Judah, to bring up
from thence the a ark of God, whose
name is called by the name of the
Lord of hosts that dwelleth between
the b cherubims.
3 And they set the ark of God upon
a new cart, and brought it out of
the house of Abinadab that was in
Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the
sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.
4 And they brought it out of the
house of Abinadab which was at
Gibeah, accompanying the ark of
God: and Ahio went before the ark.
5 And David and all the house of
Israel played before the Lord on

cornets, and on cymbals.
6 ¶ And when they came to Nachon’s threshingfloor, Uzzah put
forth his hand to the a ark of God, and
took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.
7 And the anger of the Lord was
kindled against a Uzzah; and God
b 
smote him there for his error; and
there he died by the ark of God.
8 And David was displeased, because the Lord had made a breach
upon Uzzah: and he called the name
of the place a Perez-uzzah to this day.
9 And David was afraid of the
Lord that day, and said, How shall
the ark of the Lord come to me?
10 So David would not remove the
ark of the Lord unto him into the
city of David: but David carried it
aside into the house of Obed-edom
the Gittite.
11 And the ark of the Lord continued in the house of Obed-edom
the Gittite three months: and the
Lord blessed Obed-edom, and all
his household.
12 ¶ And it was told king David,
saying, The Lord hath blessed the
house of Obed-edom, and all that
pertaineth unto him, because of the
a 
ark of God. So David went and
brought up the ark of God from the
house of Obed-edom into the city
of David with gladness.
13 And it was so, that when they
that bare the ark of the Lord had
gone six paces, he a sacrificed oxen
and fatlings.
14 And David a danced before the
Lord with all his might; and David
was girded with a linen ephod.
15 So David and all the house of
Israel brought up the ark of the
Lord with shouting, and with the
sound of the trumpet.

into the city of David, Michal Saul’s
daughter looked through a window,
and saw king David leaping and
dancing before the Lord; and she
despised him in her heart.
17 ¶ And they brought in the a ark
of the Lord, and set it in his place,
in the midst of the tabernacle that
David had pitched for it: and David
offered burnt offerings and peace
offerings before the Lord.
18 And as soon as David had made
an end of offering burnt offerings
and peace offerings, he a blessed
the people in the name of the Lord
of hosts.
19 And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude
of Israel, as well to the women as
men, to every one a cake of bread,
and a good piece of flesh, and a a
flagon of wine. So all the people
departed every one to his house.
20 ¶ Then David returned to a bless
his household. And b Michal the
daughter of Saul came out to meet
David, and said, How glorious was
the king of Israel to day, who c uncovered himself to day in the eyes
of the handmaids of his servants,
as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!
21 And David said unto Michal, It
was before the Lord, which chose
me before thy father, and before
all his house, to appoint me ruler
over the people of the Lord, over
Israel: therefore will I play before
the Lord.
22 And I will yet be more vile
than thus, and will be base in mine
own sight: and of the maidservants
which thou hast spoken of, of them
shall I be had in honour.

of Saul had no child unto the day
of her death.

Chapter 7

David offers to build a house for the
Lord—The Lord, through Nathan, says
He has not asked David to do so—The
Lord will establish David’s house and
kingdom forever—David offers a prayer
of thanksgiving.
And it came to pass, when the king
sat in his house, and the Lord had
given him a rest round about from
all his enemies;
2 That the king said unto Nathan
the prophet, See now, I dwell in an
house of cedar, but the ark of God
dwelleth within a curtains.
3 And Nathan said to the king, Go,
do all that is in thine a heart; for the
Lord is with thee.
4 ¶ And it came to pass that night,
that the word of the Lord came
unto a Nathan, saying,
5 Go and tell my servant David,
Thus saith the Lord, Shalt thou
build me an a house for me to dwell
in?
6 Whereas I have not dwelt in any
house since the time that I brought
up the children of Israel out of
Egypt, even to this day, but have
walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.
7 In all the places wherein I have
walked with all the children of Israel
spake I a word with any of the tribes
of Israel, whom I commanded to
feed my people Israel, saying, Why
build ye not me an a house of cedar?
8 Now therefore so shalt thou say
unto my servant David, Thus saith
the Lord of hosts, I took thee from
the a sheepcote, from following the
sheep, to be ruler over my people,
over Israel:
9 And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off
all thine enemies out of thy sight,
and have made thee a great name,

like unto the name of the great men
that are in the earth.
10 Moreover I will appoint a place
for my people Israel, and will plant
them, that they may dwell in a
place of their own, and move no
more; neither shall the children of
wickedness afflict them any more,
as beforetime,
11 And as since the time that I
commanded a judges to be over my
people Israel, and have caused thee
to b rest from all thine enemies. Also
the Lord telleth thee that he will
make thee an c house.
12 ¶ And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with
thy fathers, I will set up thy a seed
after thee, which shall proceed out
of thy bowels, and I will establish
his kingdom.
13 He shall a build an house for
my name, and I will b stablish the
throne of his kingdom for ever.
14 I will be his a father, and he shall
be my b son. If he commit iniquity,
I will c chasten him with the rod of
men, and with the stripes of the

away from him, as I took it from
Saul, whom I put away before thee.
16 And thine a house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever
before thee: thy b throne shall be
established for ever.
17 According to all these words, and
according to all this vision, so did
Nathan speak unto David.
18 ¶ Then went king David in, and
sat before the Lord, and he said,
Who am I, O Lord God? and what
is my house, that thou hast brought
me hitherto?

this the manner of man, O Lord God?
20 And what can David say more
unto thee? for thou, Lord God,
a 
knowest thy servant.
21 For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou
done all these a great things, to make
thy servant know them.
22 Wherefore thou art great, O
Lord God: for there is none a like
thee, neither is there any God beside
thee, according to all that we have
heard with our ears.
23 And what one a nation in the
earth is like thy people, even like
Israel, whom God went to redeem
for a people to himself, and to make
him a name, and to do for you great
things and terrible, for thy land,
before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from
the nations and their gods?
24 For thou hast a confirmed to thyself thy people b Israel to be a people
unto thee for ever: and thou, Lord,
art become their God.
25 And now, O Lord God, the word
that thou hast spoken concerning
thy servant, and concerning his
house, a establish it for ever, and do
as thou hast said.
26 And let thy name be magnified
for ever, saying, The Lord of hosts
is the God over Israel: and let the

27 For thou, O Lord of hosts, God
of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an
house: therefore hath thy servant
found in his heart to pray this
prayer unto thee.

that God, and thy words be a true,
and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:

Chapter 8
David defeats and subjects many nations—The Lord is with him—He exe­
cutes judgment and justice unto all
his people.
And after this it came to pass, that
David a smote the Philistines, and
subdued them: and David took
Metheg-ammah out of the hand of
the Philistines.
2 And he smote a Moab, and b measured them with a line, casting them
down to the ground; even with two
lines measured he to put to death,
and with one full line to keep alive.
And so the c Moabites became David’s
servants, and brought gifts.
3 ¶ David smote also Hadadezer,
the son of Rehob, king of Zobah,
as he went to recover his border at
the river Euphrates.
4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred
horsemen, and twenty thousand
footmen: and David houghed all
the chariot horses, but reserved of
them for an hundred chariots.
5 And when the a Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king
of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians
two and twenty thousand men.
6 Then David put garrisons in Syria
of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought
gifts. And the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went.

Jerusalem.
8 And from Betah, and from
Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king
David took exceeding much brass.
9 ¶ When Toi king of Hamath
heard that David had smitten all
the host of Hadadezer,
10 Then Toi sent Joram his son
unto king David, to salute him, and
to bless him, because he had fought
against Hadadezer, and smitten
him: for Hadadezer had wars with
Toi. And Joram brought with him
vessels of silver, and vessels of gold,
and vessels of brass:
11 Which also king David did a dedicate unto the Lord, with the silver
and gold that he had dedicated of
all nations which he subdued;

the children of a Ammon, and of the
b

he returned from smiting of the
Syrians in the valley of a salt, being
eighteen thousand men.

throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of  a Edom became
David’s servants. And the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went.

and justice unto all his people.

David seeks to honor the house of
Saul—He finds Mephibosheth, the son
of Jonathan, to whom he restores all
the land of Saul.
And David said, Is there yet any
that is left of the house of Saul,
that I may shew him a kindness for
b 
Jonathan’s sake?
2 And there was of the house of
Saul a servant whose name was
a 
Ziba. And when they had called
him unto David, the king said unto
him, Art thou Ziba? And he said,
Thy servant is he.
3 And the king said, Is there not
yet any of the house of Saul, that I
may shew the kindness of God unto
him? And Ziba said unto the king,
a 
Jonathan hath yet a son, which is
lame on his feet.
4 And the king said unto him,
Where is he? And Ziba said unto
the king, Behold, he is in the house
of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in
Lo-debar.
5 ¶ Then king David sent, and
fetched him out of the house of
Machir, the son of Ammiel, from
Lo-debar.
6 Now when a Mephibosheth, the
son of Jonathan, the son of Saul,
was come unto David, he fell on
his face, and did reverence. And
David said, Mephibosheth. And he
answered, Behold thy servant!

not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father’s sake,
and will restore thee all the land of

Saul thy father; and thou shalt a eat
bread at my table continually.
8 And he bowed himself, and
said, What is thy servant, that thou
shouldest look upon such a a dead
dog as I am?
9 ¶ Then the king called to Ziba,
Saul’s servant, and said unto him,
I have given unto thy master’s son
all that pertained to Saul and to
all his house.
10 Thou therefore, and thy sons,
and thy servants, shall till the land
for him, and thou shalt bring in the
fruits, that thy master’s son may have
food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy
master’s son shall eat bread alway
at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen
sons and twenty servants.
11 Then said Ziba unto the king,
According to all that my lord the
king hath commanded his servant,
so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall
eat at my table, as one of the king’s
sons.
12 And Mephibosheth had a young
son, whose name was Micha. And
all that dwelt in the house of Ziba
were a servants unto Mephibosheth.
13 So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually
at the king’s table; and was lame on
both his feet.

David’s messengers are abused by the
Ammonites—Israel defeats the Ammon­
ites and Syrians.
And it came to pass after this, that
the king of the children of a Ammon
died, and Hanun his son reigned
in his stead.
2 Then said David, I will shew
kindness unto Hanun the son of
Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to
comfort him by the hand of his
servants for his father. And David’s
servants came into the land of the
children of Ammon.

3 And the princes of the children
of Ammon said unto Hanun their
lord, Thinkest thou that David doth
honour thy father, that he hath sent
comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants unto
thee, to search the city, and to spy
it out, and to overthrow it?
4 Wherefore Hanun took David’s
servants, and shaved off the one
half of their beards, and cut off
their garments in the middle, even to
their buttocks, and sent them away.
5 When they told it unto David,
he sent to meet them, because the
men were greatly ashamed: and the
king said, Tarry at Jericho until your
beards be grown, and then return.
6 ¶ And when the children of
Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon
sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob, and the Syrians of Zoba,
twenty thousand footmen, and of
king Maacah a thousand men, and
of a Ish-tob twelve thousand men.
7 And when David heard of it, he
sent Joab, and all the host of the
mighty men.
8 And the children of Ammon
came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate:
and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ish-tob, and Maacah, were
by themselves in the field.
9 When Joab saw that the front
of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the
choice men of Israel, and put them
in array against the Syrians:
10 And the rest of the people he
delivered into the hand of Abishai
his brother, that he might put them
in array against the children of
Ammon.
11 And he said, If the Syrians be
too strong for me, then thou shalt
help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I
will come and help thee.

good.
13 And Joab drew nigh, and the
people that were with him, unto the
battle against the Syrians: and they
fled before him.
14 And when the children of a Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
then fled they also before Abishai,
and entered into the city. So Joab
returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
15 ¶ And when the Syrians saw
that they were smitten before Israel,
they gathered themselves together.
16 And Hadarezer sent, and brought
out the Syrians that were beyond the
river: and they came to Helam; and
Shobach the captain of the host of
Hadarezer went before them.
17 And when it was told David,
he gathered all Israel together, and
passed over Jordan, and came to
Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and
fought with him.
18 And the Syrians fled before
Israel; and David slew the men of
seven hundred chariots of the Syri­
ans, and forty thousand horsemen,
and smote Shobach the captain of
their host, who died there.
19 And when all the kings that
were servants to Hadarezer saw that
they were smitten before Israel,
they made peace with Israel, and
served them. So the Syrians feared
to help the children of Ammon any
more.

the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried
still at Jerusalem.
2 ¶ And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off
his bed, and walked upon the roof of
the king’s house: and from the roof
he a saw a woman washing herself;
and the woman was very beautiful
to b look upon.
3 And David sent and inquired
after the woman. And one said, Is
not this a Bath-sheba, the daughter
of Eliam, the wife of b Uriah the
Hittite?
4 And David sent messengers, and
took her; and she came in unto him,
and he a lay with her; for she was
purified from her uncleanness: and
she returned unto her house.
5 And the woman conceived, and
sent and told David, and said, I am
with child.
6 ¶ And David sent to Joab, saying,
Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab
sent Uriah to David.
7 And when Uriah was come unto
him, David demanded of him how
Joab did, and how the people did,
and how the war prospered.
8 And David said to Uriah, Go
down to thy house, and wash thy
feet. And Uriah departed out of the
king’s house, and there followed
him a a mess of meat from the king.
9 But Uriah slept at the door of the
king’s house with all the servants
of his lord, and went not down to
his house.
10 And when they had told David,
saying, Uriah went not down unto
his house, David said unto Uriah,
Camest thou not from thy journey ?
why then didst thou not go down
unto thine house?

in the open fields; shall I then go
into mine house, to eat and to drink,
and to lie with my wife? as thou
livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will
not do this thing.
12 And David said to Uriah, Tarry
here to day also, and to morrow I
will let thee depart. So Uriah abode
in Jerusalem that day, and the
morrow.
13 And when David had called
him, he did eat and drink before
him; and he made him drunk: and
at even he went out to lie on his
bed with the servants of his lord,
but went not down to his house.
14 ¶ And it came to pass in the
morning, that David wrote a letter
to Joab, and sent it by the hand of
Uriah.
15 And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront
of the hottest battle, and retire ye
from him, that he may be a smitten,
and die.
16 And it came to pass, when Joab
observed the city, that he assigned
Uriah unto a place where he knew
that valiant men were.
17 And the men of the city went
out, and fought with Joab: and
there fell some of the people of the
servants of David; and Uriah the
Hittite died also.
18 ¶ Then Joab sent and told David
all the things concerning the war;
19 And charged the messenger,
saying, When thou hast made an
end of telling the matters of the
war unto the king,
20 And if so be that the king’s

Wherefore approached ye so nigh

Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall?
then say thou, Thy servant Uriah
the Hittite is dead also.
22 ¶ So the messenger went, and
came and shewed David all that
Joab had sent him for.
23 And the messenger said unto
David, Surely the men prevailed
against us, and came out unto us into
the field, and we were upon them
even unto the entering of the gate.
24 And the shooters shot from off
the wall upon thy servants; and
some of the king’s servants be dead,
and thy servant Uriah the Hittite
is dead also.
25 Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto
Joab, Let not this thing displease
thee, for the sword devoureth one
as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city,
and overthrow it: and encourage
thou him.
26 ¶ And when the wife of Uriah
heard that Uriah her husband was
dead, she mourned for her husband.
27 And when the mourning was
past, David sent and fetched her to
his house, and she became his a wife,
and bare him a son. But the thing
that David had done b displeased
the Lord.
Chapter 12
Nathan tells David the parable of the
ewe lamb—The Lord gave many wives
to David, who is now cursed for taking
Bathsheba—David fasts and prays for
his son, but the Lord takes him—Solomon is born—David conquers the royal
city of the Ammonites.
And the Lord sent a Nathan unto
David. And he came unto him, and
said unto him, There were two men
in one city; the one rich, and the
other poor.

He feared David might
be angry because so
many were killed with
Uriah.

2 The rich man had exceeding
many flocks and herds:
3 But the poor man had nothing,
save one little ewe lamb, which he
had bought and nourished up: and
it grew up together with him, and
with his children; it did eat of his
own meat, and drank of his own
cup, and lay in his bosom, and was
unto him as a daughter.
4 And there came a traveller unto
the rich man, and he spared to take
of his own flock and of his own
herd, to dress for the wayfaring man
that was come unto him; but took
the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it
for the man that was come to him.
5 And David’s anger was greatly
kindled against the man; and he
said to Nathan, As the Lord liveth,
the man that hath done this thing
shall surely die:
6 And he shall restore the lamb
a 
fourfold, because he did this thing,
and because he had no pity.
7 ¶ And Nathan said to David,
Thou art the man. Thus saith the
Lord God of Israel, I a anointed thee
king over Israel, and I delivered thee
out of the hand of Saul;
8 And I gave thee thy master’s
house, and thy master’s wives into thy
bosom, and gave thee the house of
Israel and of Judah; and if that had
been too little, I would moreover have
given unto thee such and such things.

do evil in his sight? thou hast b killed

and hast taken his d wife to be thy

cause thou hast a despised me, and
hast taken the wife of Uriah the

11 Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I
will raise up a evil against thee out
of thine own house, and I will take
thy wives before thine eyes, and
give them unto thy neighbour, and
he shall lie with thy wives in the
sight of this sun.
12 For thou didst it secretly: but I
will a do this thing before all Israel,
and before the sun.
13 And David said unto Nathan, I
have a sinned against the Lord. And
Nathan said unto David, The Lord
also b hath put away thy sin; thou
shalt not die.
14 Howbeit, because by this deed
thou hast given great occasion to
the enemies of the Lord to a blaspheme, the child also that is born
unto thee shall surely die.
15 ¶ And Nathan departed unto
his house. And the Lord struck the
child that Uriah’s wife bare unto
David, and it was very sick.
16 David therefore besought God for
the child; and David a fasted, and went
in, and lay all night upon the earth.
17 And the elders of his house
arose, and went to him, to raise him
up from the earth: but he would not,
neither did he eat bread with them.
18 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And
the servants of David feared to tell
him that the child was dead: for
they said, Behold, while the child
was yet alive, we spake unto him,
and he would not hearken unto our
voice: how will he then vex himself,
if we tell him that the child is dead?

that the child was dead: therefore
David said unto his servants, Is
the child dead? And they said, He
is dead.
20 Then David arose from the
earth, and washed, and anointed
himself, and changed his a apparel,
and came into the house of the
Lord, and worshipped: then he
came to his own house; and when
he required, they set bread before
him, and he did eat.
21 Then said his servants unto
him, What thing is this that thou
hast done? thou didst a fast and weep
for the child, while it was alive; but
when the child was dead, thou didst
rise and eat bread.
22 And he said, While the child
was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for
I said, Who can tell whether God will
be gracious to me, that the child
may live?
23 But now he is dead, wherefore
should I fast? can I bring him back
again? I shall go to him, but he shall
not return to me.

her, and lay with her: and she bare
a son, and he called his name b Solomon: and the Lord loved him.

of the people together, and encamp
against the city, and take it: lest I
take the city, and it be called after

Amnon the son of David loved her.
2 And Amnon was so vexed, that
he fell sick for his sister Tamar;
for she was a virgin; and Amnon
thought it hard for him to do any
thing to her.
3 But Amnon had a friend, whose
name was a  Jonadab, the son of
Shimeah David’s brother: and Jona­
dab was a very subtil man.
4 And he said unto him, Why
art thou, being the king’s son, lean
from day to day ? wilt thou not tell
me? And Amnon said unto him, I
love a Tamar, my brother Absalom’s
sister.
5 And Jonadab said unto him, Lay
thee down on thy bed, and make
thyself sick: and when thy father
cometh to see thee, say unto him, I
pray thee, let my sister Tamar come,
and give me meat, and dress the
meat in my sight, that I may see it,
and eat it at her hand.
6 ¶ So Amnon lay down, and made

himself sick: and when the king was
come to see him, Amnon said unto
the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my
sister come, and make me a couple
of cakes in my sight, that I may eat
at her hand.
7 Then David sent home to Tamar,
saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and dress him meat.
8 So Tamar went to her brother
Amnon’s house; and he was laid
down. And she took flour, and
kneaded it, and made cakes in his
sight, and did bake the cakes.
9 And she took a pan, and poured
them out before him; but he refused
to eat. And Amnon said, Have out
all men from me. And they went
out every man from him.
10 And Amnon said unto Tamar,
Bring the meat into the chamber,
that I may eat of thine hand. And
Tamar took the cakes which she
had made, and brought them into
the chamber to Amnon her brother.
11 And when she had brought
them unto him to eat, he a took hold
of her, and said unto her, Come lie
with me, my sister.
12 And she answered him, Nay,
my brother, do not a force me; for
no such thing ought to be done in
Israel: do not thou this b folly.
13 And I, whither shall I cause
my a shame to go? and as for thee,
thou shalt be as one of the fools in
Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee,
speak unto the king; for he will not
withhold me from thee.
14 Howbeit he would not hearken
unto her voice: but, being stronger
than she, forced her, and lay with her.
15 ¶ Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than
the love wherewith he had loved
her. And Amnon said unto her,
Arise, be gone.
16 And she said unto him, There
is no cause: this evil in sending me
away is greater than the other that
thou didst unto me. But he would
not hearken unto her.

	12	a	 tg  Sexual Immorality.

17 Then he called his servant that
ministered unto him, and said, Put
now this woman out from me, and
bolt the door after her.
18 And she had a garment of di­
vers colours upon her: for with such
robes were the king’s daughters that
were virgins apparelled. Then his
servant brought her out, and bolted
the door after her.
19 ¶ And Tamar put ashes on her
head, and rent her garment of di­
vers colours that was on her, and
laid her hand on her head, and
went on crying.
20 And Absalom her brother said
unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother
been with thee? but hold now thy
peace, my sister: he is thy brother;
regard not this thing. So Tamar
remained desolate in her brother
Absalom’s house.
21 ¶ But when king David heard of
all these things, he was very wroth.
22 And Absalom spake unto his
brother Amnon neither good nor
bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
23 ¶ And it came to pass after two
full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited
all the king’s sons.
24 And Absalom came to the king,
and said, Behold now, thy servant
hath sheepshearers; let the king, I
beseech thee, and his servants go
with thy servant.
25 And the king said to Absalom,
Nay, my son, let us not all now go,
lest we be chargeable unto thee. And
he pressed him: howbeit he would
not go, but blessed him.
26 Then said Absalom, If not, I
pray thee, let my brother Amnon
go with us. And the king said unto
him, Why should he go with thee?
27 But Absalom pressed him, that
he let Amnon and all the king’s sons
go with him.
28 ¶ Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark
ye now when Amnon’s heart is

		b	 Lev. 18:9 (6–22).
	13	a	 tg  Shame.

2 Samuel 13:29–14:9

merry with wine, and when I say
unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill
him, fear not: have not I commanded
you? be a courageous, and be valiant.
29 And the servants of Absalom
did unto Amnon as Absalom had
commanded. Then all the king’s
sons arose, and every man gat him
up upon his mule, and fled.
30 ¶ And it came to pass, while
they were in the way, that tidings
came to David, saying, Absalom
hath slain all the king’s sons, and
there is not one of them left.
31 Then the king arose, and tare
his garments, and lay on the earth;
and all his servants stood by with
their clothes rent.
32 And a Jonadab, the son of
Shimeah David’s brother, answered
and said, Let not my lord suppose
that they have slain all the young
men the king’s sons; for Amnon
only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been
determined from the day that he
forced his sister Tamar.
33 Now therefore let not my lord
the king take the thing to his heart,
to think that all the king’s sons are
dead: for Amnon only is dead.
34 But Absalom fled. And the
young man that kept the watch
lifted up his eyes, and looked, and,
behold, there came much people
by the way of the hill side behind
him.
35 And Jonadab said unto the king,
Behold, the king’s sons come: as thy
servant said, so it is.
36 And it came to pass, as soon as
he had made an end of speaking,
that, behold, the king’s sons came,
and lifted up their voice and wept:
and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.
37 ¶ But Absalom fled, and went to
Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king
of a Geshur. And David mourned
for his son every day.
38 So Absalom fled, and went to
Geshur, and was there three years.
39 And the soul of king David
	28	a	 tg  Hypocrisy.

longed to go forth unto Absalom:
for he was comforted concerning
Amnon, seeing he was dead.
Chapter 14
Joab arranges by artifice to bring Absalom home after three years—After two
more years, Absalom sees the king, and
they are reconciled.
Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was toward Absalom.
2 And Joab sent to Tekoah, and
fetched thence a wise woman, and
said unto her, I pray thee, feign
thyself to be a mourner, and put
on now mourning apparel, and
anoint not thyself with oil, but be
as a woman that had a long time
mourned for the dead:
3 And come to the king, and speak
on this manner unto him. So Joab
put the words in her mouth.
4 ¶ And when the woman of
Tekoah spake to the king, she fell
on her face to the ground, and did
obeisance, and said, Help, O king.
5 And the king said unto her, What
aileth thee? And she answered, I am
indeed a widow woman, and mine
husband is dead.
6 And thy handmaid had two sons,
and they two strove together in the
field, and there was none to part
them, but the one smote the other,
and slew him.
7 And, behold, the whole family is
risen against thine handmaid, and
they said, Deliver him that smote
his brother, that we may kill him,
for the life of his brother whom he
slew; and we will destroy the heir
also: and so they shall quench my
coal which is left, and shall not
leave to my husband neither name
nor remainder upon the earth.
8 And the king said unto the
woman, Go to thine house, and I
will give charge concerning thee.
9 And the woman of Tekoah said
unto the king, My lord, O king, the
iniquity be on me, and on my father’s

	32	a	 2 Sam. 13:3.

	37	a	 2 Sam. 3:3.

445

2 Samuel 14:10–28

house: and the king and his throne
be guiltless.
10 And the king said, Whosoever
saith ought unto thee, bring him
to me, and he shall not touch thee
any more.
11 Then said she, I pray thee, let
the king remember the Lord thy
God, that thou wouldest not suffer
the a revengers of blood to destroy
any more, lest they destroy my son.
And he said, As the Lord liveth,
there shall not one hair of thy son
fall to the earth.
12 Then the woman said, Let thine
handmaid, I pray thee, speak one
word unto my lord the king. And
he said, Say on.
13 And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such
a thing against the people of God?
for the king doth speak this thing
as one which is faulty, in that the
king doth not fetch home again his
banished.
14 For we must needs die, and are
as water spilt on the ground, which
cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person:
yet doth he devise means, that his
banished be not a expelled from
him.
15 Now therefore that I am come to
speak of this thing unto my lord the
king, it is because the people have
made me afraid: and thy handmaid
said, I will now speak unto the king;
it may be that the king will perform
the request of his handmaid.
16 For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand
of the man that would destroy me
and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
17 Then thine handmaid said, The
word of my lord the king shall now
be comfortable: for as an angel of
God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the
Lord thy God will be with thee.
18 Then the king answered and
said unto the woman, Hide not from
me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall

	14	a	 tg  God, Mercy of.

ask thee. And the woman said, Let
my lord the king now speak.
19 And the king said, Is not the
hand of Joab with thee in all this?
And the woman answered and said,
As thy soul liveth, my lord the king,
none can turn to the right hand
or to the left from ought that my
lord the king hath spoken: for thy
servant Joab, he bade me, and he
put all these words in the mouth
of thine handmaid:
20 To fetch about this form of
speech hath thy servant Joab done
this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel
of God, to know all things that are
in the earth.
21 ¶ And the king said unto Joab,
Behold now, I have done this thing:
go therefore, bring the young man
Absalom again.
22 And Joab fell to the ground on
his face, and bowed himself, and
a 
thanked the king: and Joab said,
To day thy servant knoweth that I
have found grace in thy sight, my
lord, O king, in that the king hath
fulfilled the request of his servant.
23 So Joab arose and went to
Geshur, and brought Absalom to
Jerusalem.
24 And the king said, Let him turn
to his own house, and let him not see
my face. So Absalom returned to his
own house, and saw not the king’s face.
25 ¶ But in all Israel there was
none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole
of his foot even to the crown of his
head there was no blemish in him.
26 And when he polled his head,
(for it was at every year’s end that
he polled it: because the hair was
heavy on him, therefore he polled
it:) he weighed the hair of his head
at two hundred shekels after the
king’s weight.
27 And unto Absalom there were
born three a sons, and one daughter,
whose name was Tamar: she was a
woman of a fair countenance.
28 ¶ So Absalom dwelt two full

	22	a	 heb  blessed.
	27	a	 2 Sam. 18:18.

2 Samuel 14:29–15:14

446

years in Jerusalem, and saw not
the king’s face.
29 Therefore Absalom sent for
Joab, to have sent him to the king;
but he would not come to him: and
when he sent again the second time,
he would not come.
30 Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab’s field is near mine,
and he hath barley there; go and set
it on fire. And Absalom’s servants
set the field on fire.
31 Then Joab arose, and came to
Absalom unto his house, and said
unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?
32 And Absalom answered Joab,
Behold, I sent unto thee, saying,
Come hither, that I may send thee
to the king, to say, Wherefore am
I come from a Geshur? it had been
good for me to have been there still:
now therefore let me see the king’s
face; and if there be any iniquity
in me, let him kill me.
33 So Joab came to the king, and
told him: and when he had called
for Absalom, he came to the king,
and bowed himself on his face to
the ground before the king: and the
king kissed Absalom.
Chapter 15
Absalom conspires against David and
gains the support of the people—David
flees, and Absalom enters Jerusalem.
And it came to pass after this, that
Absalom prepared him chariots
and horses, and fifty men to run
before him.
2 And a Absalom rose up early, and
stood beside the way of the gate:
and it was so, that when any man
that had a controversy came to the
king for judgment, then Absalom
called unto him, and said, Of what
city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.
3 And Absalom said unto him, See,
thy matters are good and right; but

there is no man deputed of the king
to hear thee.
4 Absalom said moreover, Oh that
I were made judge in the land, that
every man which hath any suit or
cause might come unto me, and I
would do him justice!
5 And it was so, that when any
man came nigh to him to do him
obeisance, he put forth his hand,
and took him, and kissed him.
6 And on this manner did Absalom
to all Israel that came to the king
for judgment: so a Absalom stole the
hearts of the men of Israel.
7 ¶ And it came to pass after forty
years, that Absalom said unto the
king, I pray thee, let me go and pay
my vow, which I have vowed unto
the Lord, in Hebron.
8 For thy servant vowed a vow
while I abode at a Geshur in Syria,
saying, If the Lord shall bring me
again indeed to Jerusalem, then I
will serve the Lord.
9 And the king said unto him, Go
in peace. So he arose, and went to
Hebron.
10 ¶ But Absalom sent spies
throughout all the tribes of Israel,
saying, As soon as ye hear the sound
of the trumpet, then ye shall say,
Absalom reigneth in Hebron.
11 And with Absalom went two
hundred men out of Jerusalem,
that were called; and they went in
their simplicity, and they knew not
any thing.
12 And Absalom sent for a Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s b counsellor, from his city, even from c Giloh,
while he offered sacrifices. And
the d conspiracy was strong; for the
people increased continually with
Absalom.
13 ¶ And there came a messenger
to David, saying, The hearts of the
men of Israel are after Absalom.
14 And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusa­
lem, Arise, and let us a flee; for we

shall not else escape from Absalom:
make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil
upon us, and smite the city with
the edge of the sword.
15 And the king’s servants said
unto the king, Behold, thy servants
are ready to do whatsoever my lord
the king shall appoint.
16 And the king went forth, and
all his household after him. And
the king left ten women, which were
a 
concubines, to keep the house.
17 And the king went forth, and
all the people after him, and tarried
in a place that was far off.
18 And all his servants passed on
beside him; and all the Cherethites,
and all the Pelethites, and all the
Gittites, six hundred men which
came after him from Gath, passed
on before the king.
19 ¶ Then said the king to Ittai the
Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also
with us? return to thy place, and
abide with the king: for thou art a
stranger, and also an exile.
20 Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee
go up and down with us? seeing I
go whither I may, return thou, and
take back thy brethren: mercy and
truth be with thee.
21 And Ittai answered the king,
and said, As the Lord liveth, and
as my lord the king liveth, surely in
what place my lord the king shall
be, whether in death or life, even
there also will thy servant be.
22 And David said to Ittai, Go
and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite
passed over, and all his men, and all
the little ones that were with him.
23 And all the country wept with
a loud voice, and all the people
passed over: the king also himself
passed over the brook Kidron, and
all the people passed over, toward
the way of the wilderness.
24 ¶ And lo a Zadok also, and all
the Levites were with him, bearing
the ark of the covenant of God:
	16	a	 2 Sam. 16:21.
	24	a	 2 Sam. 8:17; 19:11.

		b	 1 Kgs. 1:42.

and they set down the ark of God;
and b Abiathar went up, until all
the people had done passing out of
the city.
25 And the king said unto Zadok,
Carry back the ark of God into the
city: if I shall find favour in the
eyes of the Lord, he will bring me
again, and shew me both it, and his
habitation:
26 But if he thus say, I have no
delight in thee; behold, here am I,
let him do to me as seemeth good
unto him.
27 The king said also unto Zadok
the priest, Art not thou a a seer? return into the city in peace, and
your two sons with you, Ahimaaz
thy son, and b Jonathan the son of
Abiathar.
28 See, I will tarry in the plain of
the wilderness, until there come
word from you to certify me.
29 Zadok therefore and Abiathar
carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.
30 ¶ And David went up by the
ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as
he went up, and had his a head covered, and he went barefoot: and all
the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they
went up, weeping as they went up.
31 ¶ And one told David, saying,
Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said,
O Lord, I pray thee, turn the a counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
32 ¶ And it came to pass, that when
David was come to the top of the
mount, where he worshipped God,
behold, Hushai the Archite came to
meet him with his coat rent, and
earth upon his head:
33 Unto whom David said, If thou
passest on with me, then thou shalt
be a burden unto me:
34 But if thou return to the city,
and say unto Absalom, I will be thy
servant, O king; as I have been thy
father’s servant hitherto, so will I
now also be thy servant: then mayest

2 Samuel 15:35–16:14

thou for me defeat the counsel of
Ahithophel.
35 And hast thou not there with
thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests?
therefore it shall be, that what thing
soever thou shalt hear out of the
king’s house, thou shalt tell it to
Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
36 Behold, they have there with
them their two sons, Ahimaaz
Zadok’s son, and Jonathan Abiathar’s
son; and by them ye shall send unto
me every thing that ye can hear.
37 So Hushai David’s friend came
into the city, and Absalom came
into Jerusalem.
Chapter 16
Mephibosheth is alleged to be seeking to
be king—Shimei, of the house of Saul,
curses David—Ahithophel counsels Absalom, and Absalom takes his father’s
concubines.
And when David was a little past
the top of the hill, behold, a Ziba the
servant of Mephibosheth met him,
with a couple of asses saddled, and
upon them two hundred loaves of
bread, and an hundred bunches of
raisins, and an hundred of summer
fruits, and a bottle of wine.
2 And the king said unto Ziba,
What meanest thou by these? And
Ziba said, The asses be for the king’s
household to ride on; and the bread
and summer fruit for the young
men to eat; and the wine, that such
as be faint in the wilderness may
drink.
3 And the king said, And where
is thy master’s son? And Ziba said
unto the king, Behold, he abideth
at Jerusalem: for he said, To day
shall the house of Israel restore me
the kingdom of my father.
4 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained
unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I
humbly beseech thee that I may find
grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.

5 ¶ And when king David came to
Bahurim, behold, thence came out
a man of the family of the house
of Saul, whose name was a Shimei,
the son of Gera: he came forth, and
b 
cursed still as he came.
6 And he cast stones at David,
and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the
mighty men were on his right hand
and on his left.
7 And thus said Shimei when he
cursed, Come out, come out, thou
bloody man, and thou a  man of
Belial:
8 The Lord hath returned upon
thee all the blood of the house
of Saul, in whose stead thou hast
reigned; and the Lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of
Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou
art taken in thy mischief, because
thou art a bloody man.
9 ¶ Then said Abishai the son of
Zeruiah unto the king, Why should
this a dead dog curse my lord the
king? let me go over, I pray thee,
and take off his head.
10 And the king said, What have I
to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah?
so let him curse, because the Lord
hath said unto him, Curse David.
Who shall then say, Wherefore hast
thou done so?
11 And David said to Abishai, and
to all his servants, Behold, my son,
which came forth of my bowels,
seeketh my life: how much more
now may this Benjamite do it? let
him alone, and let him curse; for
the Lord hath bidden him.
12 It may be that the Lord will
look on mine affliction, and that
the Lord will a requite me good for
his cursing this day.
13 And as David and his men went
by the way, Shimei went along on
the hill’s side over against him, and
cursed as he went, and threw stones
at him, and cast dust.
14 And the king, and all the people

that were with him, came weary, and
refreshed themselves there.
15 ¶ And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
16 And it came to pass, when
Hushai the Archite, David’s friend,
was come unto Absalom, that Hushai
said unto Absalom, a God save the
king, God save the king.
17 And Absalom said to Hushai, Is
this thy kindness to thy friend? why
wentest thou not with thy friend?
18 And Hushai said unto Absalom,
Nay; but whom the Lord, and this
people, and all the men of Israel,
choose, his will I be, and with him
will I abide.
19 And again, whom should I
serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in
thy father’s presence, so will I be
in thy presence.
20 ¶ Then said Absalom to Ahith­
ophel, Give counsel among you what
we shall do.
21 And Ahithophel said unto
Absalom, Go in unto thy father’s
a 
concubines, which he hath left to
keep the house; and all Israel shall
hear that thou art abhorred of thy
father: then shall the hands of all
that are with thee be strong.
22 So they spread Absalom a tent
upon the top of the house; and
a 
Absalom went in unto his father’s
concubines in the sight of all Israel.
23 And the counsel of a Ahithophel,
which he counselled in those days,
was as if a man had inquired at the
b 
oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David
and with Absalom.

Ahithophel’s counsel is overthrown by
Hushai’s—David is warned and flees
over the Jordan—Ahithophel hangs
himself—The people prepare for war.
Moreover Ahithophel said unto
Absalom, Let me now choose out
	16	a	 heb  Let the king live,
let the king live!
	21	a	 2 Sam. 15:16.

twelve thousand men, and I will
arise and pursue after David this
night:
2 And I will come upon him while
he is weary and weak handed, and
will make him afraid: and all the
people that are with him shall flee;
and I will smite the king only:
3 And I will bring back all the
people unto thee: the man whom
thou seekest is as if all returned:
so all the people shall be in peace.
4 And the saying pleased Absalom
well, and all the a elders of Israel.
5 Then said Absalom, Call now
Hushai the Archite also, and let us
hear likewise what he saith.
6 And when Hushai was come to
Absalom, Absalom spake unto him,
saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after
his saying? if not; speak thou.
7 And Hushai said unto Absalom,
The counsel that Ahithophel hath
given is not good at this time.
8 For, said Hushai, thou knowest
thy father and his men, that they be
mighty men, and they be a chafed in
their minds, as a bear robbed of her
whelps in the field: and thy father
is a man of war, and will not lodge
with the people.
9 Behold, he is hid now in some
pit, or in some other place: and it
will come to pass, when some of
them be overthrown at the first,
that whosoever heareth it will say,
There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.
10 And he also that is valiant,
whose heart is as the heart of a
lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel
knoweth that thy father is a mighty
man, and they which be with him
are valiant men.
11 Therefore I counsel that all
Israel be generally gathered unto
thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba,
as the sand that is by the sea for
multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.
12 So shall we come upon him in

some place where he shall be found,
and we will light upon him as the
dew falleth on the ground: and of
him and of all the men that are
with him there shall not be left so
much as one.
13 Moreover, if he be gotten into
a city, then shall all Israel bring
ropes to that city, and we will draw
it into the river, until there be not
one small stone found there.
14 And Absalom and all the men
of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai
the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the Lord
had a appointed to defeat the good
b 
counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the Lord might bring evil
upon Absalom.
15 ¶ Then said Hushai unto Zadok
and to Abiathar the priests, Thus
and thus did Ahithophel counsel
Absalom and the a elders of Israel;
and thus and thus have I counselled.
16 Now therefore send quickly,
and tell David, saying, Lodge not
this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest
the king be swallowed up, and all
the people that are with him.
17 Now a Jonathan and Ahimaaz
stayed by En-rogel; for they might
not be seen to come into the city:
and a wench went and told them;
and they went and told king David.
18 Nevertheless a lad saw them,
and told Absalom: but they went
both of them away quickly, and
came to a man’s house in Bahurim,
which had a well in his court;
whither they went down.
19 And the woman took and spread
a covering over the well’s mouth,
and spread ground corn thereon;
and the thing was not known.
20 And when Absalom’s servants
came to the woman to the house,
they said, Where is Ahimaaz and
Jonathan? And the woman said
unto them, They be gone over the
brook of water. And when they had

or  ordered, ordained.

sought and could not find them, they
returned to Jerusalem.
21 And it came to pass, after they
were departed, that they came up
out of the well, and went and told
king David, and said unto David,
Arise, and pass quickly over the
water: for thus hath Ahithophel
counselled against you.
22 Then David arose, and all the
people that were with him, and they
passed over Jordan: by the morning
light there lacked not one of them
that was not gone over Jordan.
23 ¶ And when Ahithophel saw
that his counsel was not followed,
he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat
him home to his house, to his a city,
and put his household in order, and
hanged himself, and died, and was
buried in the sepulchre of his father.
24 Then David came to Mahanaim.
And Absalom passed over Jordan, he
and all the men of Israel with him.
25 ¶ And Absalom made a Amasa
captain of the host instead of b Joab:
which Amasa was a man’s son, whose
name was Ithra an Israelite, that
went in to Abigail the daughter
of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab’s
mother.
26 So Israel and Absalom pitched
in the land of Gilead.
27 ¶ And it came to pass, when
David was a come to Mahanaim, that
Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah
of the children of Ammon, and
Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and b Barzillai the Gileadite
of Rogelim,
28 Brought beds, and basins, and
earthen vessels, and wheat, and
barley, and flour, and parched corn,
and beans, and lentiles, and parched
pulse,
29 And a honey, and butter, and
sheep, and cheese of b kine, for David, and for the people that were
with him, to eat: for they said, The
people is hungry, and weary, and
thirsty, in the wilderness.

Chapter 18

The Israelites are smitten in the woods
of Ephraim—Joab slays Absalom—Tidings of his death are taken to David,
who mourns for his son.
And David numbered the people
that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of
hundreds over them.
2 And David sent forth a third
part of the people under the hand
of Joab, and a third part under the
hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah,
Joab’s brother, and a third part
under the hand of Ittai the Gittite.
And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you
myself also.
3 But the people answered, Thou
shalt not a go forth: for if we flee away,
they will not care for us; neither if
half of us die, will they care for us:
but now thou art worth ten thousand
of us: therefore now it is better that
thou b succour us out of the city.
4 And the king said unto them,
What seemeth you best I will do.
And the king stood by the gate side,
and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.
5 And the king commanded a Joab
and Abishai and Ittai, saying, b Deal
gently for my sake with the young
man, even with Absalom. And all the
people heard when the king gave
all the captains charge concerning
Absalom.
6 ¶ So the people went out into the
field against Israel: and the battle
was in the a wood of Ephraim;
7 Where the people of Israel were
slain before the servants of David,
and there was there a great slaughter
that day of twenty thousand men.
8 For the battle was there scattered
over the face of all the country: and
the wood devoured more people
that day than the sword devoured.
9 ¶ And Absalom met the servants
of David. And Absalom rode upon a
mule, and the mule went under the
18	3	a	 2 Sam. 21:17.
		b	 heb  help us.
	5	a	 1 Kgs. 2:5.

thick boughs of a great oak, and his
head caught hold of the oak, and he
was taken up between the heaven
and the earth; and the mule that
was under him went away.
10 And a certain man saw it, and
told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw
Absalom hanged in an oak.
11 And Joab said unto the man
that told him, And, behold, thou
sawest him, and why didst thou not
smite him there to the ground? and
I would have given thee ten shekels
of silver, and a girdle.
12 And the man said unto Joab,
Though I should receive a thousand
shekels of silver in mine hand, yet
would I not put forth mine hand
against the king’s son: for in our
hearing the king a charged thee and
Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware
that none touch the young man
Absalom.
13 Other wise I should have
wrought falsehood against mine
own life: for there is no matter hid
from the king, and thou thyself
wouldest have set thyself against me.
14 Then said Joab, I may not tarry
thus with thee. And he took three
darts in his hand, and thrust them
through the heart of Absalom,
while he was yet alive in the midst
of the oak.
15 And ten young men that bare
Joab’s armour compassed about
and smote Absalom, and slew him.
16 And Joab blew the trumpet, and
the people returned from pursuing
after Israel: for Joab held back the
people.
17 And they took Absalom, and
cast him into a great pit in the
wood, and laid a very great heap
of stones upon him: and all Israel
fled every one to his tent.
18 ¶ Now Absalom in his lifetime
had taken and reared up for himself
a pillar, which is in the a king’s dale:
for he said, I have no b son to keep my
name in remembrance: and he called
the pillar after his own name: and it

is called unto this day, Absalom’s
c 
place.
19 ¶ Then said Ahimaaz the son
of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear
the king tidings, how that the Lord
hath avenged him of his enemies.
20 And Joab said unto him, Thou
shalt not bear tidings this day, but
thou shalt bear tidings another day:
but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king’s son is dead.
21 Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell
the king what thou hast seen. And
Cushi bowed himself unto Joab,
and ran.
22 Then said Ahimaaz the son of
Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run
after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing
that thou hast no tidings ready ?
23 But howsoever, said he, let me
run. And he said unto him, Run.
Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of
the plain, and overran Cushi.
24 And David sat between the two
gates: and the watchman went up to
the roof over the gate unto the wall,
and lifted up his eyes, and looked,
and behold a man running alone.
25 And the watchman cried, and
told the king. And the king said, If
he be alone, there is tidings in his
mouth. And he came apace, and
drew near.
26 And the watchman saw another
man running: and the watchman
called unto the porter, and said,
Behold another man running alone.
And the king said, He also bringeth
tidings.
27 And the watchman said, Me
thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz
the son of Zadok. And the king said,
He is a good man, and cometh with
good tidings.
28 And Ahimaaz called, and said
unto the king, All is well. And he
fell down to the earth upon his face
before the king, and said, Blessed
be the Lord thy God, which hath
delivered up the men that lifted up
their hand against my lord the king.

29 And the king said, Is the young
man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz
answered, When Joab sent the king’s
servant, and me thy servant, I saw a
great tumult, but I knew not what
it was.
30 And the king said unto him,
Turn aside, and stand here. And he
turned aside, and stood still.
31 And, behold, Cushi came; and
Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the
king: for the Lord hath avenged
thee this day of all them that rose
up against thee.
32 And the king said unto Cushi,
Is the young man Absalom safe?
And Cushi answered, The enemies
of my lord the king, and all that
rise against thee to do thee hurt, be
as that young man is.
33 ¶ And the king was much
moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and
as he went, thus he said, O my son
Absalom, my son, my son Absalom!
would God I had died for thee, O
Absalom, my son, my son!
Chapter 19
Joab rebukes David for favoring his
enemies instead of his friends—David
replaces Joab with Amasa—Shimei,
who cursed David, is pardoned—Mephibosheth pledges allegiance to David—The men of Judah take David
back to Jerusalem.
And it was told Joab, Behold, the
king weepeth and mourneth for
Absalom.
2 And the victory that day was
turned into mourning unto all the
people: for the people heard say
that day how the king was grieved
for his son.
3 And the people gat them by
stealth that day into the city, as
people being ashamed steal away
when they flee in battle.
4 But the king covered his face, and
the king cried with a loud voice, O
my son Absalom, O Absalom, my
son, my son!
5 And Joab came into the house to

453

2 Samuel 19:6–22

the king, and said, Thou hast shamed
this day the faces of all thy servants,
which this day have saved thy life,
and the lives of thy sons and of thy
daughters, and the lives of thy wives,
and the lives of thy concubines;
6 In that thou lovest thine enemies,
and hatest thy friends. For thou hast
declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for
this day I perceive, that if Absalom
had lived, and all we had died this
day, then it had pleased thee well.
7 Now therefore arise, go forth,
and a speak comfortably unto thy
servants: for I swear by the Lord,
if thou go not forth, there will not
tarry one with thee this night: and
that will be worse unto thee than
all the evil that befell thee from
thy youth until now.
8 Then the king arose, and sat in
the gate. And they told unto all the
people, saying, Behold, the king
doth sit in the gate. And all the
people came before the king: for
Israel had fled every man to his
tent.
9 ¶ And all the people were at
a 
strife throughout all the tribes of
Israel, saying, The king saved us out
of the hand of our enemies, and he
delivered us out of the hand of the
Philistines; and now he is fled out
of the land for Absalom.
1 0  A n d Ab s a l om , w h om we
anointed over us, is dead in battle.
Now therefore why speak ye not a
word of bringing the king back?
11 ¶ And king David sent to a Za­
dok and to Abiathar the priests,
saying, Speak unto the elders of
Judah, saying, Why are ye the last
to bring the king back to his house?
seeing the speech of all Israel is
come to the king, even to his house.
12 Ye are my a brethren, ye are my
bones and my flesh: wherefore
then are ye the last to bring back
the king?

13 And say ye to a Amasa, Art thou
not of my bone, and of my flesh? God
do so to me, and more also, if thou
be not captain of the host before
me continually in the room of Joab.
14 And he bowed the heart of all
the men of Judah, even as the heart
of one man; so that they sent this
word unto the king, Return thou,
and all thy servants.
15 So the king returned, and came
to Jordan. And Judah came to a Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.
16 ¶ And a Shimei the son of Gera,
a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,
hasted and came down with the
men of Judah to meet king David.
17 And there were a thousand men
of Benjamin with him, and Ziba
the servant of the house of Saul,
and his fifteen sons and his twenty
servants with him; and they went
over Jordan before the king.
18 And there went over a ferry boat
to carry over the king’s household,
and to do what he thought good.
And Shimei the son of Gera fell
down before the king, as he was
come over Jordan;
19 And said unto the king, Let
not my lord impute iniquity unto
me, neither do thou remember that
which thy servant did perversely the
day that my lord the king went out
of Jerusalem, that the king should
take it to his heart.
20 For thy servant doth know that
I have sinned: therefore, behold, I
am come the first this day of all
the house of Joseph to go down to
meet my lord the king.
21 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah
answered and said, Shall not Shimei
be put to death for this, because he
a 
cursed the Lord’s b anointed?
22 And David said, What have I to do
with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye
should this day be adversaries unto
me? shall there any man be put to

death this day in Israel? for do not
I know that I am this day king over
Israel?
23 Therefore the king said unto
Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And
the king sware unto him.
24 ¶ And a Mephibosheth the son
of Saul came down to meet the
king, and had neither dressed his
feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor
washed his clothes, from the day
the king departed until the day he
came again in peace.
25 And it came to pass, when he
was come to Jerusalem to meet the
king, that the king said unto him,
Wherefore wentest not thou with
me, Mephibosheth?
26 And he answered, My lord, O
king, my a servant deceived me: for
thy servant said, I will saddle me
an ass, that I may ride thereon, and
go to the king; because thy servant
is lame.
27 And he hath slandered thy
servant unto my lord the king; but
my lord the king is as an angel of
God: do therefore what is good in
thine eyes.
28 For all of my father’s house were
but dead men before my lord the
king: yet didst thou set thy servant
among them that did a eat at thine
own table. What right therefore have
I yet to cry any more unto the king?
29 And the king said unto him,
Why speakest thou any more of thy
matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba
divide the land.
30 And Mephibosheth said unto
the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come
again in peace unto his own house.
31 ¶ And a Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and
went over Jordan with the king, to
conduct him over Jordan.
32 Now a Barzillai was a very aged
man, even fourscore years old: and
he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim;
for he was a very great man.

	26	a	 2 Sam. 9:12 (9–13).
	28	a	 2 Sam. 9:7 (7, 10, 13).

33 And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I
will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.
34 And Barzillai said unto the
king, How long have I to live, that
I should go up with the king unto
Jerusalem?
35 I am this day fourscore years old:
and can I discern between good and
evil? can thy servant taste what I
eat or what I drink? can I hear any
more the voice of singing men and
singing women? wherefore then
should thy servant be yet a burden
unto my lord the king?
36 Thy servant will go a little way
over Jordan with the king: and why
should the king recompense it me
with such a reward?
37 Let thy servant, I pray thee,
turn back again, that I may die
in mine own city, and be buried by
the grave of my father and of my
mother. But behold thy servant
Chimham; let him go over with my
lord the king; and do to him what
shall seem good unto thee.
38 And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and
I will do to him that which shall
seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that
will I do for thee.
39 And all the people went over
Jordan. And when the king was
come over, the king kissed Barzillai,
and blessed him; and he returned
unto his own place.
40 Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with
him: and all the people of Judah
conducted the king, and also half
the people of Israel.
41 ¶ And, behold, all the men of
Israel came to the king, and said
unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee
away, and have brought the king,
and his household, and all David’s
a 
men with him, over Jordan?
42 And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because

the king is near of a kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king’s
cost? or hath he given us any gift?
43 And the men of Israel answered
the men of Judah, and said, We
have ten parts in the king, and we
have also more right in David than
ye: why then did ye despise us, that
our advice should not be first had
in bringing back our king? And
the words of the men of Judah were
fiercer than the words of the men
of Israel.
Chapter 20
Sheba leads the tribes of Israel away
from David—Joab slays Amasa and
pursues Sheba—A wise woman intercedes—The death of Sheba ends the
insurrection.
And there happened to be there
a man of a Belial, whose name was
Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjam­
ite: and he blew a trumpet, and
said, We have no part in David,
neither have we inheritance in the
son of Jesse: every man to his tents,
O Israel.
2 So every man of Israel went
up from after David, and followed
Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men
of Judah clave unto their king, from
Jordan even to Jerusalem.
3 ¶ And David came to his house
at Jerusalem; and the king took the
ten women his a concubines, whom
he had left to keep the house, and
put them in ward, and fed them,
but went not in unto them. So they
were shut up unto the day of their
death, living in widowhood.
4 ¶ Then said the king to a Amasa,
Assemble me the men of Judah
within three days, and be thou
here present.
5 So Amasa went to assemble the
men of Judah: but he tarried longer
than the set time which he had
appointed him.
6 And David said to Abishai, Now
	42	a	 2 Sam. 19:12.
20	1	a	 Deut. 13:13.
	3	a	 Jacob 1:15.

shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us
more harm than did Absalom: take
thou thy lord’s servants, and pursue
after him, lest he get him a fenced
cities, and escape us.
7 And there went out after him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites, and
the Pelethites, and all the mighty
men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son
of Bichri.
8 When they were at the great
stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa
went before them. And Joab’s garment that he had put on was girded
unto him, and upon it a girdle with
a sword fastened upon his loins in
the sheath thereof; and as he went
forth it fell out.
9 And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou
in health, my brother? And Joab
took Amasa by the beard with the
right hand to a kiss him.
10 But a Amasa took no heed to the
sword that was in Joab’s hand: so he
smote him therewith in the b fifth
rib, and shed out his bowels to the
ground, and struck him not again;
and he died. So Joab and Abishai
his brother pursued after Sheba the
son of Bichri.
11 And one of Joab’s men stood
by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David,
let him go after Joab.
12 And Amasa wallowed in blood
in the midst of the highway. And
when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa
out of the highway into the field,
and cast a cloth upon him, when
he saw that every one that came by
him stood still.
13 When he was removed out of
the highway, all the people went
on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba
the son of Bichri.
14 ¶ And he went through all the
tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to
Beth-maachah, and all the Berites:
and they were gathered a together,
and went also after him.

15 And they came and besieged
him in Abel of Beth-maachah, and
they cast up a bank against the city,
and it stood in the trench: and all
the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.
16 ¶ Then cried a wise woman out
of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray
you, unto Joab, Come near hither,
that I may speak with thee.
17 And when he was come near
unto her, the woman said, Art thou
Joab? And he answered, I am he.
Then she said unto him, Hear the
words of thine handmaid. And he
answered, I do hear.
18 Then she spake, saying, They
were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at
Abel: and so they ended the matter.
19 I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother
in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up
the inheritance of the Lord?
20 And Joab answered and said,
Far be it, far be it from me, that I
should swallow up or a destroy.
21 The matter is not so: but a man
of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son
of Bichri by name, hath lifted up
his hand against the king, even
against David: deliver him only, and
I will depart from the city. And the
woman said unto Joab, Behold, his
head shall be thrown to thee over
the wall.
22 Then the woman went unto all
the people in her wisdom. And they
cut off the head of Sheba the son
of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab.
And he blew a trumpet, and they
retired from the city, every man
to his tent. And Joab returned to
Jerusalem unto the king.
23 ¶ Now a Joab was over all the
host of Israel: and Benaiah the son
of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites
and over the Pelethites:
24 And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of
Ahilud was recorder:

25 And Sheva was scribe: and

26 And Ira also the Jairite was a
chief ruler about David.
Chapter 21
The Lord sends a famine—David understands that the famine came because
Saul smote the Gibeonites, contrary to
the oath of Israel—David delivers up
seven sons of Saul to be hanged by the
Gibeonites—Israel and the Philistines
continue their wars.
Then there was a famine in the
days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the
Lord. And the Lord answered, It is
for Saul, and for his bloody house,
because he slew the Gibeonites.
2 And the king called the Gibeon­
ites, and said unto them; (now the
a 
Gibeonites were not of the children
of Israel, but of the remnant of the
Amorites; and the children of Israel
had sworn unto them: and Saul
sought to slay them in his zeal to
the children of Israel and Judah.)
3 Wherefore David said unto the
Gibeonites, What shall I do for you?
and wherewith shall I make the
atonement, that ye may bless the
inheritance of the Lord?
4 And the Gibeonites said unto
him, We will have no silver nor gold
of Saul, nor of his house; neither
for us shalt thou kill any man in
Israel. And he said, What ye shall
say, that will I do for you.
5 And they answered the king, The
man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be
destroyed from remaining in any
of the a coasts of Israel,
6 Let seven men of his a sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang
them up unto the Lord in b Gibeah
of Saul, whom the Lord did choose.
And the king said, I will give them.
7 But the king spared Mephibo­

of Saul, because of the Lord’s a oath

that was between them, between
David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
8 But the king took the two sons
of a Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,
whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni
and Mephibosheth; and the five
sons of Michal the daughter of Saul,
whom she brought up for Adriel the
son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
9 And he delivered them into the
hands of the Gibeonites, and they
hanged them in the hill before
the Lord: and they fell all seven
together, and were put to death in
the days of harvest, in the first days,
in the beginning of barley harvest.
10 ¶ And Rizpah the daughter of
Aiah took a sackcloth, and spread
it for her upon the rock, from the
beginning of harvest until water
dropped upon them out of heaven,
and suffered neither the birds of the
air to rest on them by day, nor the
beasts of the field by night.
11 And it was told David what
Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the
concubine of Saul, had done.
12 ¶ And David went and took
the bones of Saul and the bones
of Jonathan his son from the men
of Jabesh-gilead, which had stolen
them from the street of Beth-shan,
where the Philistines had hanged
them, when the Philistines had slain
Saul in Gilboa:
13 And he brought up from thence
the bones of Saul and the bones of
Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were
hanged.
14 And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the
country of Benjamin in Zelah, in
the sepulchre of Kish his father: and
they performed all that the king
commanded. And after that God
was entreated for the land.
15 ¶ Moreover the Philistines had
yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants
with him, and fought against the
Philistines: and David waxed faint.

16 And Ishbi-benob, which was of

whose spear weighed three hundred
shekels of brass in weight, he being
girded with a new sword, thought
to have slain David.
17 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah
a 
succoured him, and smote the
Philistine, and killed him. Then
the men of David sware unto him,
saying, Thou shalt b go no more out
with us to battle, that thou quench
not the light of Israel.
18 And it came to pass after this,
that there was again a a battle with
the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph,
which was of the sons of the giant.
19 And there was again a battle
in Gob with the Philistines, where
Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a
Beth-lehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the a staff of whose
spear was like a weaver’s beam.
20 And there was yet a battle in
a 
Gath, where was a man of great
stature, that had on every hand six
fingers, and on every foot six toes,
four and twenty in number; and he
also was born to the giant.
21 And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea the brother
of David slew him.
22 These four were born to the
giant in Gath, and fell by the hand
of David, and by the hand of his
servants.
Chapter 22
David praises the Lord in a psalm of
thanksgiving—The Lord is his fortress
and savior, He is mighty and powerful in
deliverance, He rewards men according
to their righteousness, He shows mercy
to the merciful, His way is perfect, He
lives, and blessed is He.
And David spake unto the Lord the
words of this a song in the day that
the Lord had delivered him out of
the hand of all his enemies, and out
of the hand of Saul:

2 And he said, The Lord is my

3 The God of my rock; in him
will I a trust: he is my b shield, and
the horn of my salvation, my high
c 
tower, and my d refuge, my saviour;
thou savest me from violence.
4 I will call on the Lord, who is
worthy to be praised: so shall I be
saved from mine enemies.
5 When the waves of death a compassed me, the floods of ungodly
men made me afraid;
6 The sorrows of a hell compassed
me about; the snares of death prevented me;
7 In my a distress I called upon the
Lord, and cried to my God: and he
did hear my voice out of his b temple,
and my cry did enter into his ears.
8 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven
moved and shook, because he was
wroth.
9 There went up a smoke out of
his nostrils, and fire out of his
mouth devoured: coals were kindled
by it.
10 He bowed the heavens also,
and came down; and darkness was
under his feet.
11 And he rode upon a a cherub,
and did fly: and he was seen upon
the wings of the wind.
12 And he made a darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters,
and thick clouds of the skies.
13 Through the brightness before
him were coals of fire kindled.
14 The Lord thundered from
heaven, and the most High uttered
his voice.

the breath of his nostrils.
17 He sent from above, he took me;
he drew me out of many waters;
18 He delivered me from my strong
enemy, and from them that hated
me: for they were too strong for me.
19 They prevented me in the day
of my calamity: but the Lord was
my stay.
20 He brought me forth also into
a a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
21 The Lord a rewarded me according to my righteousness: according
to the b cleanness of my hands hath
he recompensed me.
22 For I have kept the ways of
the Lord, and have not wickedly

not depart from them.

31 As for God, his way is a perfect;

32 For who is God, save the Lord?

36 Thou hast also given me the

37 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.
38 I have pursued mine enemies,

again until I had consumed them.
39 And I have consumed them,

man who was raised up on high, the
anointed of the God of Jacob, and
the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,

5 Although my house be not so with
God; yet he hath made with me an
a 
everlasting covenant, ordered in all
things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although
he make it not to grow.
6 ¶ But the sons of Belial shall be
all of them as thorns thrust away,
because they cannot be taken with
hands:
7 But the man that shall touch
them must be a fenced with iron
and the staff of a spear; and they
shall be utterly burned with fire
in the same place.
8 ¶ These be the names of the
a 
mighty men whom David had: The
Tachmonite that sat in the seat,
chief among the captains; the same
was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his
spear against eight hundred, whom
he slew at one time.
9 And after him was Eleazar the
son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the
three mighty men with David, when
they defied the Philistines that were
there gathered together to battle, and
the men of Israel were gone away:
10 He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and
his hand clave unto the sword: and
the Lord wrought a great victory
that day; and the people returned
after him only to spoil.
11 And after him was Shammah the
son of Agee the Hararite. And the
Philistines were gathered together
into a troop, where was a piece of
ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.
12 But he stood in the midst of
the ground, and defended it, and
slew the Philistines: and the Lord
wrought a great victory.
13 And three of the thirty chief
went down, and came to David
in the harvest time unto the cave
of Adullam: and the troop of the
Philistines pitched in the valley
of Rephaim.
14 And David was then in an hold,
and the garrison of the Philistines
was then in Beth-lehem.

15 And David longed, and said,
Oh that one would give me drink
of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!
16 And the three mighty men
brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the
well of Beth-lehem, that was by the
gate, and took it, and brought it to
David: nevertheless he would not
drink thereof, but poured it out
unto the Lord.
17 And he said, Be it far from me,
O Lord, that I should do this: is not
this the blood of the men that went
in jeopardy of their lives? therefore
he would not drink it. These things
did these three mighty men.
18 And Abishai, the brother of
Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief
among three. And he lifted up
his spear against three hundred,
and slew them, and had the name
among three.
19 Was he not most a honourable
of three? therefore he was their
captain: howbeit he attained not
unto the first three.
20 And a Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of
Kabzeel, who had done many acts,
he slew two lionlike men of Moab:
he went down also and slew a lion
in the midst of a pit in time of snow:
21 And he slew an Egyptian, a
goodly man: and the Egyptian had a
spear in his hand; but he went down
to him with a staff, and plucked
the spear out of the Egyptian’s
hand, and slew him with his own
spear.
22 These things did Benaiah the
son of Jehoiada, and had the name
among three mighty men.
23 He was more honourable than
the thirty, but he attained not to
the first three. And David set him
over his guard.

David sins in numbering Israel and Judah—The men of war total 1,300,000—
The Lord destroys 70,000 men by pestilence—David sees an angel, offers
sacrifice, and the plague is stayed.
And again the anger of the Lord
was kindled against Israel, and a he
moved David against them to say,
Go, b number Israel and Judah.
2 For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him,
Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba,
and number ye the people, that I
may know the number of the people.
3 And Joab said unto the king,
24	1	a	 Apparently something

is missing, and
“Satan” should be the
antecedent of “he.” See

Now the Lord thy God add unto the
people, how many soever they be,
an hundredfold, and that the eyes
of my lord the king may see it: but
why doth my lord the king delight
in this thing?
4 Notwithstanding the king’s word
prevailed against Joab, and against
the captains of the host. And Joab
and the captains of the host went
out from the presence of the king,
to number the people of Israel.
5 ¶ And they passed over Jordan,
and pitched in Aroer, on the right
side of the city that lieth in the midst
of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:
6 Then they came to Gilead, and
to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and
they came to Dan-jaan, and about
to Zidon,
7 And came to the strong hold of
Tyre, and to all the cities of the
Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and
they went out to the south of Judah,
even to Beer-sheba.
8 So when they had gone through
all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and
twenty days.
9 And Joab gave up the sum of
the a number of the people unto
the king: and there were in Israel
b 
eight hundred thousand valiant
men that drew the sword; and the
men of Judah were five hundred
thousand men.
10 ¶ And David’s heart smote him
after that he had numbered the
people. And David said unto the
Lord, I have sinned greatly in that I
have done: and now, I beseech thee,
O Lord, take away the iniquity of
thy servant; for I have done very
foolishly.
11 For when David was up in the
morning, the word of the Lord
came unto the a prophet Gad, David’s b seer, saying,
12 Go and say unto David, Thus
saith the Lord, I offer thee three

things; choose thee one of them, that
I may do it unto thee.
13 So Gad came to David, and told
him, and said unto him, Shall seven
years of a famine come unto thee in
thy land? or wilt thou flee three
months before thine enemies, while
they pursue thee? or that there be
three days’ pestilence in thy land?
now advise, and see what answer
I shall return to him that sent me.
14 And David said unto Gad, I
am in a great strait: let us fall now
into the hand of the Lord; for his
a 
mercies are great: and let me not
fall into the hand of man.
15 ¶ So the Lord sent a pestilence
upon Israel from the morning even
to the time appointed: and there
died of the people from Dan even to
Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.
16 And when the angel stretched
out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, a the Lord repented him of
the evil, and said to the angel that
destroyed the people, It is enough:
b 
stay now thine hand. And the angel of the Lord was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.
17 And David spake unto the Lord
when he saw the angel that smote
the people, and said, Lo, I have
sinned, and I have done wickedly:
but these sheep, what have they
done? let thine hand, I pray thee,
be against me, and against my
father’s house.

the threshingfloor of Araunah the
Jebusite.
19 And David, according to the
saying of Gad, went up as the Lord
commanded.
20 And Araunah looked, and saw
the king and his servants coming
on toward him: and Araunah went
out, and bowed himself before the
king on his face upon the ground.
21 And Araunah said, Wherefore
is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the
threshingfloor of thee, to build an
altar unto the Lord, that the plague
may be stayed from the people.
22 And Araunah said unto David,
Let my lord the king take and offer
up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice,
and threshing instruments and other
instruments of the oxen for wood.
23 All these things did Araunah,
as a king, give unto the king. And
Araunah said unto the king, The
Lord thy God accept thee.
24 And the king said unto Araunah,
Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee
at a price: neither will I offer burnt
offerings unto the Lord my God of
that which doth cost me nothing.
So David bought the threshingfloor
and the oxen for a fifty shekels of
silver.
25 And David built there an a altar
unto the Lord, and offered burnt
offerings and peace b offerings. So
the Lord was entreated for the
land, and the plague was stayed
from Israel.

the Lord said unto him,
Stay now thine hand, it
is enough; for the people
repented, and the Lord
stayed the hand of the
angel, that he destroyed
not the people . . .

Commonly Called

Chapter 1
Abishag cherishes David in his extreme
age—Adonijah aspires to be king—
Bathsheba and Nathan advise David
of Adonijah’s plotting—David names
Solomon as king, and he is anointed by
Zadok—Adonijah’s cause fails.
ow king David was old and
stricken in years; and they
covered him with clothes,
but he gat no heat.
2 Wherefore his servants said unto
him, Let there be sought for my
lord the king a young virgin: and
let her stand before the king, and let
her a cherish him, and let her lie in
thy bosom, that my lord the king
may get heat.
3 So they sought for a fair damsel
throughout all the a coasts of Israel,
and found b Abishag a Shunammite,
and brought her to the king.
4 And the damsel was very fair, and
cherished the king, and ministered
to him: but the king knew her not.
5 ¶ Then a Adonijah the son of
Haggith exalted himself, saying, I
will be king: and he prepared him
chariots and horsemen, and fifty
men to run before him.
6 And his father had not displeased
him at any time in saying, Why
hast thou done so? and he also was
a very a goodly man; and his mother
bare him after b Absalom.
7 And he conferred with Joab the
son of Zeruiah, and with a Abiathar
the priest: and they following b Adonijah helped him.

8 But Zadok the priest, and Be­
naiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and
Rei, and the mighty men which
belonged to David, were not with
Adonijah.
9 And Adonijah slew sheep and
oxen and fat cattle by the stone of
Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and
called all his brethren the king’s
sons, and all the men of Judah the
king’s servants:
10 But Nathan the prophet, and
Benaiah, and the mighty men,
and Solomon his brother, he called
not.
11 ¶ Wherefore Nathan spake unto
Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon,
saying, Hast thou not heard that
Adonijah the son of Haggith doth
reign, and David our lord knoweth
it not?
12 Now therefore come, let me, I
pray thee, give thee counsel, that
thou mayest save thine own life,
and the life of thy son Solomon.
13 Go and get thee in unto king
David, and say unto him, Didst not
thou, my lord, O king, swear unto
thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly
a 
Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my
throne? why then doth Adonijah
reign?
14 Behold, while thou yet talkest
there with the king, I also will come
in after thee, and confirm thy words.
15 ¶ And Bath-sheba went in unto
the king into the chamber: and the
king was very old; and Abishag the

Shunammite ministered unto the
king.
16 And Bath-sheba bowed, and
did obeisance unto the king. And
the king said, What wouldest thou?
17 And she said unto him, My
lord, thou a swarest by the Lord thy
God unto thine handmaid, saying,
Assuredly Solomon thy son shall
reign after me, and he shall sit upon
my throne.
18 And now, behold, Adonijah
reigneth; and now, my lord the king,
thou knowest it not:
19 And he hath slain oxen and fat
cattle and sheep in abundance, and
hath called all the sons of the king,
and Abiathar the priest, and Joab
the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.
20 And thou, my lord, O king, the
eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that
thou shouldest tell them who shall
sit on the throne of my lord the
king after him.
21 Otherwise it shall come to pass,
when my lord the king shall sleep
with his fathers, that I and my son
Solomon shall be counted offenders.
22 ¶ And, lo, while she yet talked
with the king, Nathan the prophet
also came in.
23 And they told the king, saying,
Behold Nathan the prophet. And
when he was come in before the
king, he bowed himself before the
king with his face to the ground.
24 And Nathan said, My lord, O
king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall
reign after me, and he shall sit upon
my throne?
25 For he is gone down this day,
and hath slain oxen and fat cattle
and sheep in abundance, and hath
called all the king’s sons, and the
captains of the host, and Abiathar
the priest; and, behold, they eat and
drink before him, and say, a God
save king Adonijah.

the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant
Solomon, hath he not called.
27 Is this thing done by my lord
the king, and thou hast not shewed
it unto thy servant, who should sit
on the throne of my lord the king
after him?
28 ¶ Then king David answered
and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And
she came into the king’s presence,
and stood before the king.
29 And the king sware, and said,
As the Lord liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,
30 Even as I sware unto thee by
the Lord God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign
after me, and he shall sit upon my
throne in my stead; even so will I
certainly do this day.
31 Then Bath-sheba bowed with
her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my
lord king David live for ever.
32 ¶ And king David said, Call
me Zadok the priest, and Nathan
the prophet, and Benaiah the son
of Jehoiada. And they came before
the king.
33 The king also said unto them,
Take with you the servants of your
lord, and cause Solomon my son
to ride upon mine own mule, and
bring him down to a Gihon:
34 And let Zadok the priest and
Nathan the prophet a anoint him
there b king over Israel: and blow
ye with the trumpet, and say, c God
save king Solomon.
35 Then ye shall come up after him,
that he may come and sit upon my
throne; for he shall be king in my
stead: and I have appointed him to
be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
36 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said,
Amen: the Lord God of my lord
the king say so too.
37 As the Lord hath been with
my lord the king, even so be he
with Solomon, and make his throne

greater than the throne of my lord
king David.
38 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan
the prophet, and Benaiah the son
of Jehoiada, and the a Cherethites,
and the b Pelethites, went down, and
caused Solomon to ride upon king
David’s mule, and brought him to
Gihon.
39 And Zadok the priest took an
horn of a oil out of the b tabernacle,
and anointed Solomon. And they
blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.
40 And all the people came up
after him, and the people piped
with pipes, and rejoiced with great
joy, so that the earth rent with the
sound of them.
41 ¶ And Adonijah and all the
guests that were with him heard it
as they had made an end of eating.
And when Joab heard the sound of
the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is
this noise of the city being in an
uproar?
42 And while he yet spake, behold,
a 
Jonathan the son of Abiathar the
priest came: and Adonijah said unto
him, Come in; for thou art a valiant
man, and bringest good tidings.
43 And Jonathan answered and
said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king
David hath made Solomon king.
44 And the king hath sent with
him Zadok the priest, and Nathan
the prophet, and Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and
the Pelethites, and they have caused
him to ride upon the king’s mule:
45 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed
him king in Gihon: and they are
come up from thence rejoicing, so
that the city rang again. This is the
noise that ye have heard.
46 And also Solomon sitteth on
the throne of the kingdom.
47 And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king

David, saying, God make the name
of Solomon better than thy name,
and make his throne greater than
thy throne. And the king bowed
himself upon the a bed.
48 And also thus said the king,
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,
which hath given one to sit on my
throne this day, mine eyes even
seeing it.
49 And all the guests that were with
Adonijah were afraid, and rose up,
and went every man his way.
50 ¶ And Adonijah feared because
of Solomon, and arose, and went,
and caught hold on the a horns of
the altar.
51 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king
Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught
hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto
me to day that he will not slay his
servant with the sword.
52 And Solomon said, If he will
shew himself a worthy man, there
shall not an hair of him fall to the
earth: but if wickedness shall be
found in him, he shall die.
53 So king Solomon sent, and they
brought him down from the altar.
And he came and bowed himself
to king Solomon: and Solomon said
unto him, Go to thine house.
Chapter 2
David charges Solomon to keep the
commandments and walk in the ways
of the Lord—King David dies and
Solomon reigns—Adonijah, Joab, and
Shimei are put to death, and Abiathar
is rejected as high priest—The kingdom
is established with Solomon.
Now the days of David drew nigh
that he should die; and he charged
a 
Solomon his son, saying,
2 I go the a way of all the earth:
be thou strong therefore, and shew
thyself a b man;

3 And keep the charge of the Lord
thy God, to a walk in his ways, to
keep his statutes, and his b commandments, and his judgments, and
his testimonies, as it is written in
the law of Moses, that thou mayest
c 
prosper in all that thou doest, and
whithersoever thou turnest thyself:
4 That the Lord may continue his
word which he spake concerning
me, saying, If thy a children take
b 
heed to their way, to walk before
me in truth with all their c heart
and with all their soul, there shall
not fail thee (said he) a man on the
d 
throne of Israel.
5 Moreover thou knowest also what
a 
Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,
and what he did to the two captains
of the hosts of Israel, unto b Abner
the son of Ner, and unto c Amasa the
son of Jether, whom he slew, and
shed the blood of war in peace,
and put the blood of war upon his
girdle that was about his loins, and
in his shoes that were on his feet.
6 Do therefore according to thy
wisdom, and let not his hoar head
go down to the grave in peace.
7 But shew kindness unto the sons
of a Barzillai the Gileadite, and let
them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I
fled because of Absalom thy brother.
8 And, behold, thou hast with thee
a 
Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite
of Bahurim, which cursed me with
a grievous curse in the day when
I went to Mahanaim: but he came
down to meet me at Jordan, and I
sware to him by the Lord, saying,
I will not put thee to death with
the sword.
9 Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and
knowest what thou oughtest to do
unto him; but his hoar head bring
thou down to the grave with blood.

and was a buried in the b city of
David.
11 And the days that David a reigned
over Israel were forty years: seven
years reigned he in Hebron, and
thirty and three years reigned he
in Jerusalem.
12 ¶ Then sat a Solomon upon the
throne of David his father; and his
kingdom was established greatly.
13 ¶ And Adonijah the son of
Haggith came to Bath-sheba the
mother of Solomon. And she said,
Comest thou peaceably ? And he
said, Peaceably.
14 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she
said, Say on.
15 And he said, Thou knowest
that the a kingdom was mine, and
that all Israel set their faces on
me, that I should reign: howbeit
the kingdom is turned about, and
is become my brother’s: for it was
his from the Lord.
16 And now I ask one petition of
thee, deny me not. And she said unto
him, Say on.
17 And he said, Speak, I pray
thee, unto Solomon the king, (for
he will not say thee nay,) that he
give me a Abishag the Shunammite
to wife.
18 And Bath-sheba said, Well; I
will speak for thee unto the king.
19 ¶ Bath-sheba therefore went
unto king Solomon, to speak unto
him for Adonijah. And the king
rose up to meet her, and bowed
himself unto her, and sat down on
his throne, and caused a seat to be
set for the king’s mother; and she
sat on his right hand.
20 Then she said, I desire one
small petition of thee; I pray thee,
say me not nay. And the king said
unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I
will not say thee nay.
21 And she said, Let Abishag the

Shunammite be given to Adonijah
thy brother to wife.
22 And king Solomon answered
and said unto his mother, And why
dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the
kingdom also; for he is mine elder
a 
brother; even for him, and for
b 
Abiathar the priest, and for Joab
the son of Zeruiah.
23 Then king Solomon sware by the
Lord, saying, God do so to me, and
more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.
24 Now therefore, as the Lord
liveth, which hath established me,
and set me on the throne of David
my father, and who hath made me
an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to a death this day.
25 And king Solomon sent by the
hand of a Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he
died.
26 ¶ And unto a Abiathar the priest
said the king, Get thee to b Anathoth,
unto thine own fields; for thou art
worthy of death: but I will not at
this time put thee to death, because
thou barest the ark of the Lord God
before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in
all wherein my father was afflicted.
27 So Solomon thrust out a Abiathar
from being priest unto the Lord;
that he might b fulfil the word of the
Lord, which he spake concerning
the house of Eli in Shiloh.
28 ¶ Then tidings came to a Joab:
for Joab had turned after b Adonijah,
though he turned not after Absalom.
And Joab fled unto the tabernacle
of the Lord, and caught hold on
the c horns of the altar.
29 And it was told king Solomon
that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord; and, behold, he
is by the altar. Then Solomon sent

Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.
30 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said unto
him, Thus saith the king, Come
forth. And he said, Nay; but I will
die here. And Benaiah brought the
king word again, saying, Thus said
Joab, and thus he answered me.
31 And the king said unto him, Do
as he hath said, and fall upon him,
and bury him; that thou mayest take
away the a innocent blood, which
Joab shed, from me, and from the
house of my father.
32 And the Lord shall return his
blood upon his own head, who fell
upon two men more righteous and
better than he, and slew them with
the sword, my father David not
knowing thereof, to wit, a Abner the
son of Ner, captain of the host of
Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether,
captain of the host of Judah.
33 Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of a Joab, and
upon the head of his seed for ever:
but upon David, and upon his seed,
and upon his house, and upon his
throne, shall there be peace for ever
from the Lord.
34 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada
went up, and fell upon him, and
slew him: and he was buried in his
own house in the wilderness.
35 ¶ And the king put a Benaiah the
son of Jehoiada in his room over the
b 
host: and c Zadok the d priest did the
king put in the room of Abiathar.
36 ¶ And the king sent and called
for a Shimei, and said unto him,
Build thee an house in Jerusalem,
and dwell there, and go not forth
thence any whither.
37 For it shall be, that on the day
thou goest out, and passest over the
brook Kidron, thou shalt know for
certain that thou shalt surely die:

thy blood shall be upon thine own
head.
38 And Shimei said unto the king,
The saying is good: as my lord the
king hath said, so will thy servant
do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem
many days.
39 And it came to pass at the end of
three years, that two of the servants
of Shimei ran away unto a Achish
son of Maachah king of Gath. And
they told Shimei, saying, Behold,
thy servants be in Gath.
40 And Shimei arose, and saddled
his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to
seek his servants: and Shimei went,
and brought his servants from Gath.
41 And it was told Solomon that
Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to
Gath, and was come again.
42 And the king sent and called
for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I
not make thee to swear by the Lord,
and a protested unto thee, saying,
Know for a certain, on the day thou
goest out, and walkest abroad any
whither, that thou shalt surely die?
and thou saidst unto me, The word
that I have heard is good.
43 Why then hast thou not kept
the oath of the Lord, and the commandment that I have charged thee
with?
44 The king said moreover to
Shimei, Thou knowest all the a wickedness which thine heart b is privy to,
that thou didst to David my father:
therefore the Lord shall return thy
wickedness upon thine own head;
45 And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be
established before the Lord for ever.
46 So the king commanded Be­
naiah the son of Jehoiada; which
went out, and fell upon him, that
he a died. And the kingdom was
established in the hand of Solomon.

Solomon loves the Lord and keeps His
commandments—The Lord appears to
Solomon and promises him a wise and
an understanding heart—He judges between two harlots and determines who
is the mother of a child.
And Solomon made a affinity with
b 
Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took
Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought
her into the c city of David, until he
had made an end of building his
own d house, and the house of the
Lord, and the e wall of Jerusalem
round about.
2 Only the people sacrificed in high
places, because there was no a house
built unto the name of the Lord,
until those days.
3 And Solomon loved the Lord,
walking in the a statutes of David
his father: only he b sacrificed and
burnt incense in high places.
4 And the king went to a Gibeon
to sacrifice there; for that was the
great b high place: a thousand burnt
offerings did Solomon offer upon
that altar.
5 ¶ In a Gibeon the Lord b appeared
to Solomon in a c dream by night:
and God said, Ask what I shall give
thee.
6 And Solomon said, Thou hast
shewed unto thy servant David my
father great mercy, according as he
walked before thee in truth, and in
righteousness, and in uprightness
of heart with thee; and thou hast
kept for him this great kindness,
that thou hast given him a son to
sit on his throne, as it is this day.
7 And now, O Lord my God, thou
hast made thy servant king instead
of David my father: and I am but a
a 
little child: I know not how to go
out or come in.

8 And thy servant is in the midst of
thy people which thou hast chosen, a
a 
great people, that cannot be b numbered nor counted for multitude.
9 Give therefore thy servant an
a 
understanding b heart to judge thy
people, that I may c discern between
good and bad: for who is able to
judge this thy so great a people?
10 And the speech pleased the
Lord, that Solomon had asked this
thing.
11 And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing,
and hast not asked for thyself long
life; neither hast asked a riches for
thyself, nor hast asked the life of
thine b enemies; but hast asked for
thyself c understanding to discern
judgment;
12 Behold, I have done according
to thy words: lo, I have a given thee
a b wise and an understanding heart;
so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall
any arise like unto thee.
13 And I have also given thee that
which thou hast not asked, both
a 
riches, and honour: so that there
shall not be any among the kings
like unto thee all thy days.
14 And if thou wilt walk in my
ways, to keep my statutes and my
a 
commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen
thy days.
15 And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came
to Jerusalem, and stood before the
a 
ark of the covenant of the Lord,
and offered up burnt offerings, and
offered peace b offerings, and made
a feast to all his servants.
16 ¶ Then came there two women,
that were harlots, unto the king, and
stood before him.

one house; and I was delivered of a
child with her in the house.
18 And it came to pass the third
day after that I was delivered, that
this woman was delivered also:
and we were together; there was no
stranger with us in the house, save
we two in the house.
19 And this woman’s child died in
the night; because she a overlaid it.
20 And she arose at midnight, and
took my son from beside me, while
thine handmaid slept, and laid it in
her bosom, and laid her dead child
in my bosom.
21 And when I rose in the morning
to give my child suck, behold, it was
dead: but when I had considered it
in the morning, behold, it was not
my son, which I did bear.
22 And the other woman said,
Nay; but the living is my son, and
the dead is thy son. And this said,
No; but the dead is thy son, and the
living is my son. Thus they spake
before the king.
23 Then said the king, The one
saith, This is my son that liveth, and
thy son is the dead: and the other
saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead,
and my son is the living.
24 And the king said, Bring me a
sword. And they brought a sword
before the king.
25 And the king said, Divide the
living child in two, and give half
to the one, and half to the other.
26 Then spake the woman whose
the living child was unto the king,
for her bowels yearned upon her
son, and she said, O my lord, give
her the living child, and in no wise
slay it. But the other said, Let it be
neither mine nor thine, but divide it.
27 Then the king answered and
said, Give her the living child, and
in no wise slay it: she is the mother
thereof.

saw that the a wisdom of God was
in him, to do judgment.
Chapter 4
The officers in Solomon’s court are
listed—Solomon reigns in peace and
prosperity over a large kingdom—His
wisdom and understanding exceed that
of all men.
So king Solomon was king over all
Israel.
2 And these were the princes which
he had; Azariah the son of Zadok
the priest,
3 Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons
of Shisha, a scribes; Jehoshaphat the
son of Ahilud, the b recorder.
4 And a Benaiah the son of Jehoiada
was over the host: and Zadok and
b 
Abiathar were the priests:
5 And Azariah the son of Nathan
was over the a officers: and Zabud
the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king’s friend:
6 And Ahishar was over the household: and a Adoniram the son of
Abda was over the b tribute.
7 ¶ And Solomon had twelve a officers over all Israel, which b provided victuals for the king and his
household: each man his month in
a year made provision.
8 And these are their names: The
son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:
9 The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and
in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh,
and Elon-beth-hanan:
10 The son of Hesed, in Aruboth;
to him pertained Sochoh, and all the
land of Hepher:
11 The son of Abinadab, in all the
region of Dor; which had Taphath
the daughter of Solomon to wife:
12 Baana the son of Ahilud; to him
pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and

all Beth-shean, which is by Zartanah

that is beyond Jokneam:
13 The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns
of Jair the son of Manasseh, which
are in Gilead; to him also pertained
the region of Argob, which is in
Bashan, threescore great cities with
walls and brasen bars:
14 Ahinadab the son of Iddo had

kingdoms from b the river unto the
land of the Philistines, and unto

the days of his life.

for one day was thirty measures

much, and largeness of heart, even

than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the

Chapter 5
Solomon solicits and gains Hiram’s help
in getting timber to build the temple—
The Israelites hew stones and cut timber for the temple.
And a Hiram king of Tyre sent his
servants unto Solomon; for he had
heard that they had anointed him
king in the room of his father: for
Hiram was ever a b lover of David.
2 And Solomon sent to a Hiram,
saying,
3 Thou knowest how that David
my father could not build an a house
unto the name of the Lord his God
for the wars which were about him
on every side, until the b Lord put
them under the soles of his feet.
4 But now the Lord my God hath
given me a rest on every side, so that
there is neither adversary nor evil
occurrent.
5 And, behold, I purpose to build
an house unto the name of the Lord
my God, as the Lord spake unto
David my father, saying, Thy son,
whom I will set upon thy throne in
thy room, he shall build an a house
unto my name.
6 Now therefore command thou
that they hew me a cedar trees out
of Lebanon; and my servants shall
be with thy servants: and unto thee
will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is
not among us any that b can skill to
hew timber like unto the Sidonians.

Hiram heard the words of Solomon,
that he rejoiced greatly, and said,
a 
Blessed be the Lord this day, which
hath given unto David a wise son
over this great people.
8 And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things
which thou sentest to me for: and
I will do all thy desire concerning
timber of cedar, and concerning
timber of a fir.
9 My servants shall bring them
down from Lebanon unto the sea:
and I will convey them by sea in
floats unto the place that thou shalt
appoint me, and will cause them to
be discharged there, and thou shalt
receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for
my household.
10 So Hiram gave Solomon cedar
trees and fir trees according to all
his desire.
11 And Solomon gave Hiram
twenty thousand measures of wheat
for food to his household, and twenty
measures of pure oil: thus gave Solo­
mon to Hiram year by year.
12 And the Lord gave Solomon
a 
wisdom, as he promised him: and
there was peace between Hiram
and Solomon; and they two made
a b league together.
13 ¶ And king Solomon raised a
a 
levy out of all Israel; and the b levy
was thirty thousand men.
14 And he sent them to Lebanon,
ten thousand a month by courses:
a month they were in Lebanon, and
two months at home: and a Adoniram was over the levy.
15 And Solomon had threescore
and ten thousand that bare a burdens, and fourscore thousand b hewers in the mountains;

stones, and hewed b stones, to lay

Solomon builds the temple—The Lord
promises to dwell among the Israelites
if they are obedient—The ornaments
of the temple are described.
And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the
children of Israel were come out
of the land of Egypt, in the a fourth
year of Solomon’s reign over Israel,
in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to b build
the c house of the Lord.
2 And the a house which king b Solo­
mon built for the Lord, the length
thereof was threescore cubits, and
the c breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty
cubits.
3 And the a porch before the temple
of the house, twenty cubits was the
length thereof, according to the
breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before
the house.
4 And for the house he made a windows of narrow lights.
5 ¶ And against the wall of the
house he built a chambers round
about, against the walls of the house

round about, both of the temple and
of the b oracle: and he made chambers round about:
6 The nethermost chamber was
five cubits broad, and the middle
was six cubits broad, and the third
was seven cubits broad: for without
in the wall of the house he made
narrowed rests round about, that
the beams should not be fastened
in the walls of the house.
7 And the house, when it was in
building, was built of a stone made
ready before it was brought thither:
so that there was neither hammer
nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in
the house, while it was in building.
8 The door for the middle chamber
was in the right side of the house:
and they went up with winding
stairs into the middle chamber, and
out of the middle into the third.
9 So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with
beams and boards of cedar.
10 And then he built chambers
against all the house, five cubits
high: and they rested on the house
with timber of cedar.
11 ¶ And the word of the Lord
came to Solomon, saying,
12 Concerning this house which
thou art in building, if thou wilt
a 
walk in my statutes, and execute
my judgments, and keep all my
commandments to walk in them;
then will I perform my b word with
thee, which I spake unto David thy
father:
13 And I will a dwell among the
children of Israel, and will not b forsake my people Israel.
14 So Solomon built the house,
and finished it.
15 And he built the walls of the
house within with boards of cedar,
both the floor of the house, and the
walls of the ceiling: and he covered

them on the inside with wood, and
covered the floor of the house with
planks of fir.
16 And he built twenty cubits on
the sides of the house, both the floor
and the walls with boards of cedar:
he even built them for it within, even
for the a oracle, even for the most
b 
holy place.
17 And the house, that is, the
temple before it, was forty cubits
long.
18 And the cedar of the house
within was carved with knops and
open flowers: all was cedar; there
was no stone seen.
19 And the oracle he prepared in
the house within, to set there the
ark of the covenant of the Lord.
20 And the oracle in the forepart
was twenty cubits in length, and
twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty
cubits in the height thereof: and he
overlaid it with pure gold; and so
covered the altar which was of cedar.
21 So Solomon overlaid the house
within with pure a gold: and he made
a partition by the chains of gold
before the oracle; and he overlaid
it with gold.
22 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished
all the house: also the whole a altar
that was by the oracle he b overlaid
with gold.
23 ¶ And within the oracle he
a 
made two b cherubims of olive tree,
each ten cubits high.
24 And five cubits was the one
wing of the cherub, and five cubits
the other wing of the cherub: from
the uttermost part of the one wing
unto the uttermost part of the other
were ten cubits.
25 And the other cherub was ten
cubits: both the cherubims were of
one measure and one size.
26 The height of the one cherub was

ten cubits, and so was it of the other
cherub.
27 And he set the cherubims within
the inner house: and they stretched
forth the wings of the a cherubims,
so that the wing of the one touched
the one wall, and the wing of the
other cherub touched the other
wall; and their wings touched one
another in the midst of the house.
28 And he overlaid the cherubims
with gold.
29 And he carved all the walls of
the house round about with carved
figures of a cherubims and palm
trees and open flowers, within and
without.
30 And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.
31 ¶ And for the entering of the
oracle he made a doors of olive tree:
the lintel and side posts were a fifth
part of the wall.
32 The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them
carvings of cherubims and palm
trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold
upon the cherubims, and upon the
palm trees.
33 So also made he for the door
of the temple posts of olive tree, a
fourth part of the wall.
34 And the two doors were of a fir
tree: the two leaves of the one door
were folding, and the two leaves of
the other door were folding.
35 And he carved thereon cheru­
bims and palm trees and open
flowers: and covered them with gold
fitted upon the carved work.
36 ¶ And he built the inner a court
with three rows of b hewed stone,
and a row of cedar beams.

according to all the fashion of it. So
was he seven years in building it.
Chapter 7
Solomon builds himself a house —
Hiram of Tyre makes the two pillars, the
molten sea, the ten bases, the ten lavers,
and all the vessels for the temple—The
molten sea (baptismal font) rests on the
backs of twelve oxen.
But Solomon was a building his
own b house thirteen years, and he
finished all his house.
2 ¶ He built also the a house of the
forest of Lebanon; the length thereof
was an hundred cubits, and the
breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the
height thereof thirty cubits, upon
four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar
beams upon the pillars.
3 And it was covered with cedar
above upon the beams, that lay on
forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.
4 And there were windows in three
rows, and light was against light in
three ranks.
5 And all the doors and posts were
square, with the windows: and light
was against light in three ranks.
6 ¶ And he made a porch of pillars;
the length thereof was fifty cubits,
and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them:
and the other pillars and the thick
a 
beam were before them.
7 ¶ Then he made a porch for the
throne where he might judge, even
the porch of judgment: and it was
covered with cedar from one side
of the floor to the other.
8 ¶ And his house where he dwelt
had another court within the porch,
which was of the like work. Solomon
made also an house for a Pharaoh’s
daughter, whom he had taken to
wife, like unto this porch.
9 All these were of costly stones,
according to the measures of hewed

stones, sawed with saws, within and
without, even from the foundation
unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.
10 And the foundation was of costly
stones, even great stones, stones of
ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
11 And above were costly stones,
after the measures of a hewed stones,
and cedars.
12 And the great a court round
about was with three rows of hewed
stones, and a row of cedar beams,
both for the inner court of the house
of the Lord, and for the porch of
the house.
13 ¶ And king Solomon sent and
fetched a Hiram out of Tyre.
14 He was a widow’s son of the tribe
of Naphtali, and his father was a man
of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he
was filled with a wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all
works in brass. And he came to king
Solomon, and b wrought all his work.
15 For he cast two a pillars of brass,
of eighteen cubits high apiece: and
a line of twelve b cubits did compass
either of them about.
16 And he made two a chapiters of
molten brass, to set upon the tops
of the pillars: the height of the one
chapiter was five cubits, and the
height of the other chapiter was
five cubits:
17 And nets of checker work, and
wreaths of chain work, for the chapi­
ters which were upon the top of the
pillars; seven for the one chapiter,
and seven for the other chapiter.
18 And he made the pillars, and
two rows round about upon the one
network, to cover the chapiters that
were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other
chapiter.
19 And the chapiters that were
upon the top of the pillars were of
lily work in the porch, four cubits.

20 And the chapiters upon the two
pillars had pomegranates also above,
over against the belly which was by
the network: and the pomegranates
were a two hundred in rows round
about upon the other chapiter.
21 And he set up the a pillars in
the porch of the temple: and he set
up the right pillar, and called the
name thereof Jachin: and he set up
the left pillar, and called the name
thereof Boaz.
22 And upon the top of the pillars
was lily work: so was the work of
the pillars finished.
23 ¶ And he made a molten a sea,
ten cubits from the one brim to
the other: it was round all about,
and his height was five cubits: and
a line of thirty cubits did compass
it round about.
24 And under the brim of it round
about there were knops compassing
it, ten in a cubit, compassing the
sea round about: the knops were
cast in two rows, when it was cast.
25 It stood upon a twelve oxen,
three looking toward the north, and
three looking toward the west, and
three looking toward the south, and
three looking toward the east: and
the sea was set above upon them, and
all their hinder parts were inward.
26 And it was an hand breadth
thick, and the brim thereof was
wrought like the brim of a cup,
with flowers of lilies: it contained
two a thousand baths.
27 ¶ And he made ten a bases of
brass; four cubits was the length
of one base, and four cubits the
breadth thereof, and three cubits
the height of it.
28 And the work of the bases was
on this manner: they had borders,
and the borders were between the
ledges:
29 And on the borders that were
between the ledges were lions, oxen,

and cherubims: and upon the ledges
there was a base above: and beneath
the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.
30 And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass:
and the four corners thereof had
undersetters: under the laver were
undersetters molten, at the side of
every addition.
31 And the mouth of it within the
chapiter and above was a cubit: but
the mouth thereof was round after
the work of the base, a cubit and
an half: and also upon the mouth of
it were gravings with their borders,
foursquare, not round.
32 And under the borders were
four wheels; and the axletrees of
the wheels were joined to the base:
and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.
33 And the work of the wheels was
like the work of a chariot wheel:
their axletrees, and their naves, and
their felloes, and their spokes, were
all molten.
34 And there were four undersetters
to the four corners of one base: and
the undersetters were of the very
base itself.
35 And in the top of the base was
there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base
the ledges thereof and the borders
thereof were of the same.
36 For on the plates of the ledges
thereof, and on the borders thereof,
he graved a cherubims, lions, and
palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions
round about.
37 After this manner he made the
ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.
38 ¶ Then made he ten a lavers of
brass: one laver contained forty
baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten
bases one laver.

39 And he put five bases on the
right side of the house, and five on
the left side of the house: and he set
the a sea on the right side of the house
eastward over against the south.
40 ¶ And Hiram made the a lavers,
and the shovels, and the basins. So
Hiram made an end of doing all the
work that he made king Solomon
for the house of the Lord:
41 The two pillars, and the two
bowls of the chapiters that were
on the top of the two pillars; and
the two networks, to cover the two
bowls of the chapiters which were
upon the top of the pillars;
42 And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two
rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the
chapiters that were upon the pillars;
43 And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;
44 And one sea, and twelve oxen
under the sea;
45 And the pots, and the shovels,
and the basins: and all these vessels,
which Hiram made to king Solomon
for the house of the Lord, were of
bright brass.
46 In the plain of Jordan did the
king cast them, in the clay ground
between Succoth and Zarthan.
47 And Solomon left all the a vessels unweighed, because they were
exceeding many: neither was the
weight of the brass found out.
48 And a Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house
of the Lord: the b altar of gold, and
the c table of gold, whereupon the
d 
shewbread was,
49 And the a candlesticks of pure
gold, five on the right side, and five
on the left, before the b oracle, with
the flowers, and the lamps, and the
tongs of gold,
50 And the bowls, and the a snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons,
and the censers of pure gold; and the

hinges of gold, both for the doors
of the inner house, the most b holy
place, and for the doors of the house,
to wit, of the temple.
51 So was ended all the work that
king Solomon made for the a house
of the Lord. And Solomon brought
in the things which David his father
had b dedicated; even the silver, and
the gold, and the vessels, did he put
among the treasures of the house
of the Lord.
Chapter 8
The ark, containing the two tablets of
stone, is placed in the holy of holies—The
glory of the Lord fills the temple—Solo­
mon offers the dedicatory prayer—He
asks for temporal and spiritual blessings upon repentant and prayerful
Israel—The people sacrifice and worship for fourteen days.
Then Solomon assembled the a elders of Israel, and all the heads of
the tribes, the b chief of the fathers
of the children of Israel, unto king
Solomon in Jerusalem, that they
might bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city
of David, which is Zion.
2 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon
at the a feast in the month Ethanim,
which is the seventh month.
3 And all the elders of Israel came,
and the a priests took up the ark.
4 And they brought up the ark
of the Lord, and the tabernacle of
the congregation, and all the holy
vessels that were in the tabernacle,
even those did the priests and the
Levites bring up.
5 And king Solomon, and all the
congregation of Israel, that were

assembled unto him, were with him
before the ark, sacrificing sheep
and oxen, that could not be told
nor numbered for multitude.
6 And the priests brought in the
a 
ark of the covenant of the Lord
unto his place, into the oracle of the
house, to the most b holy place, even
under the wings of the cherubims.
7 For the a cherubims spread forth
their two wings over the place of
the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof
above.
8 And they drew out the a staves,
that the ends of the staves were seen
out in the holy place before the b oracle, and they were not seen without:
and there they are unto this day.
9 There was nothing in the a ark
save the two b tables of stone, which
Moses put there at c Horeb, when
the Lord made a covenant with the
children of Israel, when they came
out of the land of Egypt.
10 And it came to pass, when the
priests were come out of the holy
place, that the a cloud filled the house
of the Lord,
11 So that the priests could not
stand to minister because of the
cloud: for the a glory of the Lord
had filled the house of the Lord.
12 ¶ Then spake a Solomon, The
Lord said that he would dwell in
the thick b darkness.
13 I have surely a built thee an
b 
house to dwell in, a settled place
for thee to c abide in for ever.
14 And the king turned his face
about, and a blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)

mouth unto David my father, and
hath with his hand fulfilled it,
saying,
16 Since the day that I brought
forth my people Israel out of Egypt,
I chose no city out of all the tribes
of Israel to build an house, that my
name might be therein; but I chose
a 
David to be over my people Israel.
17 And it was in the heart of David my father to build an a house for
the name of the Lord God of Israel.
18 And the Lord said unto David
my father, Whereas it was in thine
heart to build an a house unto my
name, thou didst well that it was
in thine heart.
19 Nevertheless thou shalt not
build the house; but thy a son that
shall come forth out of thy loins, he
shall build the house unto my name.
20 And the Lord hath performed
his word that he spake, and I am
risen up in the room of David my
father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised, and
have built an house for the name
of the Lord God of Israel.
21 And I have set there a place for
the ark, wherein is the a covenant of
the Lord, which he made with our
fathers, when he brought them out
of the land of Egypt.
22 ¶ And Solomon stood before
the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and a spread forth his hands
toward heaven:
23 And he said, a Lord God of Israel, there is no b God like thee, in
heaven above, or on earth beneath,
who c keepest covenant and mercy
with thy servants that d walk before
thee with all their heart:
24 Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou

promisedst him: thou spakest also
with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled
it with thine hand, as it is this day.
25 Therefore now, Lord God of
Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst
him, saying, There shall not fail
thee a man in my sight to sit on the
throne of Israel; a so that thy children
take heed to their way, that they
walk before me as thou hast walked
before me.
26 And now, O God of Israel, let
thy word, I pray thee, be verified,
which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.
27 But will God indeed dwell on
the earth? behold, the heaven and
a 
heaven of heavens cannot contain
thee; how much less this house that
I have builded?
28 Yet have thou respect unto
the prayer of thy servant, and to
his supplication, O Lord my God,
to hearken unto the cry and to the
prayer, which thy servant prayeth
before thee to day:
29 That thine eyes may be open
toward this a house night and day,
even toward the b place of which
thou hast said, My c name shall be
there: that thou mayest hearken
unto the d prayer which thy servant
shall make toward this place.
30 And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy
people Israel, when they shall pray
toward this place: and hear thou
in heaven thy dwelling place: and
when thou hearest, forgive.
31 ¶ If any man trespass against
his neighbour, and a an oath be laid
upon him to cause him to swear,
and the oath come before thine
altar in this house:

because they have b sinned against

52 That thine eyes may be open

loud voice, saying,
56 Blessed be the Lord, that hath
given rest unto his people Israel,
according to all that he promised:
there hath not a failed one b word
of all his good c promise, which he
promised by the hand of Moses his
servant.
57 The Lord our God be with us,
as he was with our fathers: let him
not leave us, nor forsake us:
58 That he may incline our hearts
unto him, to walk in all his ways,
and to keep his commandments,
and his statutes, and his judgments,
which he commanded our fathers.
59 And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the Lord, be nigh unto the
Lord our God day and night, that
he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people
Israel at all times, as the matter shall
require:
60 That all the people of the earth
may a know that the Lord is b God,
and that there is c none else.
61 Let your a heart therefore be
b 
perfect with the Lord our God, to

62 ¶ And the king, and all Israel
with him, a offered sacrifice before
the Lord.
63 And Solomon offered a a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he off­
ered unto the Lord, two and twenty
thousand oxen, and an hundred
and twenty thousand sheep. So the
king and all the children of Israel
b 
dedicated the house of the Lord.

there he offered burnt offerings,
and meat offerings, and the fat of
the peace offerings: because the
a 
brasen altar that was before the
Lord was too little to receive the
burnt offerings, and meat offerings,
and the fat of the peace offerings.
65 And at that time Solomon held
a a feast, and all Israel with him, a
great congregation, from the b entering in of Hamath unto the river
of Egypt, before the Lord our God,
seven days and seven days, even
fourteen days.
66 On the a eighth day he sent the
people away: and they blessed the
king, and went unto their tents
joyful and glad of heart for all the
goodness that the Lord had done
for David his servant, and for Israel
his people.
Chapter 9
The Lord again appears to Solomon—
The Lord promises great blessings if the
Israelites are obedient and great cursings
if they forsake Him—Solomon reigns
in splendor, levies tribute upon the nonIsraelites, and builds a navy of ships.
And it came to pass, when Solomon
had a finished the building of the
b 
house of the Lord, and the c king’s
house, and all Solomon’s desire
which he was pleased to do,
2 That the Lord a appeared to Solo­
mon the second time, as he had
appeared unto him at b Gibeon.
3 And the Lord said unto him, I have
heard thy a prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I
have hallowed this house, which thou
hast built, to put my b name there for
ever; and mine eyes and mine heart
shall be there perpetually.
4 And if thou wilt a walk before me,
as b David thy father walked, in c integrity of heart, and in uprightness,

to do according to all that I have
commanded thee, and wilt keep my
statutes and my judgments:
5 Then I will establish the a throne
of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever,
as I promised to David thy father,
saying, There shall not fail thee a
man upon the throne of Israel.
6 But if ye shall at all turn from
following me, ye or your children,
and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have
set before you, but go and serve
a 
other gods, and worship them:
7 Then will I a cut off Israel out of
the b land which I have given them;
and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out
of my sight; and Israel shall be a
proverb and a c byword among all
people:
8 And at this house, which is high,
every one that passeth by it shall
be astonished, and shall hiss; and
they shall say, Why hath the Lord
a 
done thus unto this land, and to
this house?
9 And they shall answer, Because
they forsook the Lord their God,
who brought forth their fathers out
of the land of Egypt, and have taken
hold upon other gods, and have
worshipped them, and served them:
therefore hath the Lord brought
upon them all this evil.
10 ¶ And it came to pass at the
end of twenty years, when Solomon
had built the two houses, the house
of the Lord, and the king’s house,
11 (Now Hiram the king of Tyre
had furnished Solomon with cedar
trees and fir trees, and with gold,
according to all his desire,) that then
king Solomon gave Hiram twenty
cities in the land of Galilee.
12 And Hiram came out from Tyre
to see the cities which Solomon had
given him; and they pleased him not.

13 And he said, What cities are
these which thou hast given me,
my brother? And he called them
the land of a Cabul unto this day.
14 And Hiram sent to the king
sixscore talents of gold.
15 ¶ And this is the reason of the
a 
levy which king Solomon raised;
for to build the house of the Lord,
and his own house, and b Millo, and
the c wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor,
and Megiddo, and Gezer.
16 For a Pharaoh king of Egypt
had gone up, and taken Gezer, and
burnt it with fire, and slain the
Canaanites that dwelt in the city,
and given it for a present unto his
b 
daughter, Solomon’s wife.
17 And Solomon built Gezer, and
Beth-horon the nether,
18 And Baalath, and Tadmor in
the wilderness, in the land,
19 And all the cities of store that
Solomon had, and cities for his
chari­ots, and cities for his horsemen,
and that which Solomon desired to
build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon,
and in all the land of his dominion.
20 And all the people that were left
of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites,
Hivites, and Jebusites, which were
not of the children of Israel,
21 Their a children that were left
after them in the land, whom the
children of Israel also were not able
utterly to destroy, upon those did
Solomon levy a tribute of b bondservice unto this day.
22 But of the children of Israel did
Solomon make no bondmen: but
they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his
captains, and rulers of his chariots,
and his horsemen.
23 These were the chief of the a officers that were over Solomon’s work,
five hundred and fifty, which bare

in the work.
24 ¶ But Pharaoh’s daughter came
up out of the city of David unto her
house which Solomon had built for
her: then did he build Millo.
25 ¶ And a three times in a year
did Solomon b offer burnt offerings
and peace offerings upon the altar
which he built unto the Lord, and
he burnt incense upon the altar that
was before the Lord. So he finished
the house.
26 ¶ And king Solomon made a
navy of ships in a Ezion-geber, which
is beside b Eloth, on the shore of the
Red sea, in the land of Edom.
27 And a Hiram sent in the navy his
servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants
of Solomon.
28 And they came to a Ophir, and
fetched from thence b gold, four
hundred and twenty talents, and
brought it to king Solomon.
Chapter 10
The queen of Sheba visits Solomon—
His wealth and wisdom exceed that of
all the kings of the earth.
And when the a queen of Sheba heard
of the fame of Solomon concerning
the name of the Lord, she came to
b 
prove him with hard questions.
2 And she came to Jerusalem with
a very great train, with camels that
bare spices, and very much gold, and
precious stones: and when she was
come to Solomon, she communed
with him of all that was in her
heart.
3 And Solomon told her all her
a 
questions: there was not any thing
hid from the king, which he told
her not.
4 And when the queen of Sheba had

seen all Solomon’s wisdom, and the
house that he had built,
5 And the a meat of his table, and
the sitting of his servants, and the
attendance of his ministers, and
their apparel, and his cupbearers,
and his b ascent by which he went up
unto the house of the Lord; there
was no more spirit in her.
6 And she said to the king, It was a
true report that I heard in mine own
land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.
7 Howbeit I believed not the words,
until I came, and mine eyes had
seen it: and, behold, the half was
not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I
heard.
8 Happy are thy men, happy are
these thy servants, which a stand
continually before thee, and that
hear thy wisdom.
9 a Blessed be the Lord thy God,
which delighted in thee, to set thee
on the throne of Israel: because the
Lord loved Israel for ever, therefore
made he thee king, to do judgment
and justice.
10 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of a gold,
and of spices very great store, and
precious stones: there came no more
such abundance of spices as these
which the queen of Sheba gave to
king Solomon.
11 And the a navy also of Hiram,
that brought gold from Ophir,
brought in from Ophir great plenty
of almug trees, and precious stones.
12 And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of
the Lord, and for the king’s house,
harps also and psalteries for singers:
there came no such almug trees, nor
were seen unto this day.
13 And king Solomon gave unto
the queen of Sheba all her desire,
whatsoever she asked, beside that
which Solomon gave her of his royal
bounty. So she turned and went

to her own country, she and her
servants.
14 ¶ Now the weight of gold that
came to Solomon in one year was
six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,
15 Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of
the spice merchants, and of all the
kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.
16 ¶ And king Solomon made two
hundred a targets of beaten gold:
six hundred shekels of gold went
to one target.
17 And he made three hundred
shields of beaten gold; three pound
of gold went to one shield: and the
king put them in the house of the
forest of Lebanon.
18 ¶ Moreover the king made a
great throne of ivory, and overlaid
it with the best gold.
19 The throne had six steps, and
the top of the throne was round behind: and there were a stays on either
side on the place of the seat, and
two lions stood beside the stays.
20 And twelve lions stood there on
the one side and on the other upon
the six steps: there was not the like
made in any kingdom.
21 ¶ And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the
vessels of the house of the forest of
Lebanon were of pure gold; none were
of silver: it was nothing accounted
of in the days of Solomon.
22 For the king had at sea a navy of
a 
Tharshish with the navy of Hiram:
once in three years came the navy
of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
23 So king Solomon exceeded all
the kings of the earth for a riches
and for wisdom.
24 ¶ And all the earth sought to
Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which
God had put in his heart.
25 And they brought every man his

present, vessels of silver, and vessels
of gold, and garments, and armour,
and spices, horses, and mules, a rate
year by year.
26 ¶ And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and
he had a a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand
horsemen, whom he bestowed in
the cities for chariots, and with the
king at Jerusalem.
27 And the king a made silver to be
in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars
made he to be as the sycomore trees
that are in the vale, for abundance.
28 ¶ And Solomon had horses
brought out of Egypt, and a linen
yarn: the king’s merchants received
the linen yarn at a price.
29 And a chariot came up and
went out of Egypt for six hundred
shekels of silver, and an horse for an
hundred and fifty: and so for all
the kings of the Hittites, and for the
kings of Syria, did they bring them
out by their means.
Chapter 11
Solomon marries non-Israelite women,
and his wives turn his heart to the
worship of false gods—The Lord stirs
up adversaries against him, including
Jeroboam, the son of Nebat—Ahijah
promises Jeroboam that he will be the
king of the ten tribes—Solomon dies
and Rehoboam reigns in his stead.
But king a Solomon loved many
b 
strange c women, together with the
d 
daughter of e Pharaoh, women of
the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites;

Israel, Ye shall not go in to them,
neither shall they come in unto
you: for surely they will a turn away
your heart after their gods: Solomon
clave unto these in love.
3 And he had seven hundred wives,
princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his a wives turned away
his heart.
4 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his a wives turned
away his heart after other gods: and
his heart was not perfect with the
Lord his God, b as was the heart of
David his father.
5 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians,
and after Milcom the abomination
of the Ammonites.
6 And a Solomon did evil in the
sight of the Lord, b and went not
fully after the Lord, as did David
his father.
7 Then did Solomon build an high
place for a Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the b hill that is
before Jerusalem, and for Molech,
the abomination of the children
of Ammon.
8 And likewise did he for all his
strange wives, which burnt incense
and sacrificed unto their gods.
9 ¶ And the Lord was angry with
Solomon, because his heart was
a 
turned from the Lord God of Israel,
which had b appeared unto him
twice,
10 And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should
not go after a other gods: but he
kept not that which the Lord commanded.

Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done

of thee, and thou hast not kept my

have commanded thee, I will surely
rend the b kingdom from thee, and
will give it to thy servant.
12 Notwithstanding in thy days I
will not do it for David thy father’s
sake: but I will rend it out of the
hand of thy son.
13 Howbeit I will not rend away
all the kingdom; but will give a one
tribe to thy son for David my servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake
which I have chosen.
14 ¶ And the Lord stirred up an
a 
adversary unto Solomon, Hadad
the Edomite: he was of the king’s
seed in Edom.
15 For it came to pass, when David
was in a Edom, and Joab the captain
of the host was gone up to bury the
slain, after he had smitten every
male in Edom;
16 (For six months did Joab remain
there with all Israel, until he had
cut off every male in Edom:)
17 That Hadad fled, he and certain
Edomites of his father’s servants
with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad
being yet a little child.
18 And they arose out of Midian,
and came to Paran: and they took
men with them out of Paran, and
they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh
king of Egypt; which gave him an
house, and appointed him victuals,
and gave him land.
19 And Hadad found great favour
in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he
gave him to wife the sister of his
own wife, the sister of Tahpenes
the queen.
20 And the sister of Tahpenes
bare him Genubath his son, whom
Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s
house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s household among the sons
of Pharaoh.
21 And when Hadad heard in
Egypt that David slept with his
fathers, and that Joab the captain

of the host was dead, Hadad said to
Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may
go to mine own country.
22 Then Pharaoh said unto him,
But what hast thou lacked with
me, that, behold, thou seekest to
go to thine own country ? And he
answered, Nothing: howbeit let me
go in any wise.
23 ¶ And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of
Eliadah, which fled from his lord
Hadadezer king of Zobah:
24 And he gathered men unto him,
and became captain over a band,
when David slew them of Zobah: and
they went to Damascus, and dwelt
therein, and reigned in Damascus.
25 And he was an adversary to
Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did:
and he abhorred Israel, and reigned
over Syria.
26 ¶ And Jeroboam the son of
Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda,
Solomon’s servant, whose mother’s
name was Zeruah, a widow woman,
even he lifted up his hand against
the king.
27 And this was the cause that he
lifted up his hand against the king:
Solomon built a Millo, and repaired
the breaches of the city of David
his father.
28 And the man Jeroboam was a
mighty man of valour: and Solomon
seeing the young man that he was
industrious, he made him ruler
over all the charge of the house of
Joseph.
29 And it came to pass at that
time when Jeroboam went out of
Jerusalem, that the prophet a Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the
way; and he had clad himself with
a new garment; and they two were
alone in the field:
30 And a Ahijah caught the new
garment that was on him, and rent
it in twelve pieces:
31 And he said to Jeroboam, Take

thee ten pieces: for thus saith the
Lord, the God of Israel, Behold, I
will rend the kingdom out of the
hand of Solomon, and will give a ten
tribes to thee:
32 (But he shall have a one tribe
for my servant David’s sake, and
for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which
I have chosen out of all the tribes
of Israel:)
33 Because that they have a forsaken me, and have worshipped
Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the
Moabites, and b Milcom the god of
the children of Ammon, and have
not walked in my ways, to do that
which is right in mine eyes, and to
keep my statutes and my judgments,
c 
as did David his father.
34 Howbeit I will not take the
whole kingdom out of his hand:
but I will make him prince all the
days of his life for David my servant’s sake, whom I chose, because
he kept my commandments and
my statutes:
35 But I will take the kingdom out
of his son’s hand, and will give it
unto thee, even ten tribes.
36 And unto his son will I give
a 
one b tribe, that David my servant
may have a light alway before me
in Jerusalem, the city which I have
c 
chosen me to put my name there.
37 And I will take thee, and thou
shalt reign according to all that thy
soul a desireth, and shalt be king
over Israel.
38 And it shall be, if thou wilt
hearken unto all that I command

40 Solomon sought therefore to
kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose,
and fled into Egypt, unto a Shishak
king of Egypt, and was in Egypt
until the death of Solomon.
41 ¶ And the rest of the acts of
Solomon, and all that he did, and
his wisdom, are they not written in

42 And the time that Solomon
reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel
was forty years.
43 And Solomon slept with his
fathers, and was buried in the city
of David his father: and a Rehoboam
his son reigned in his stead.
Chapter 12
Rehoboam seeks to impose greater burdens upon the people—The ten tribes

false gods.
And a Rehoboam went to Shechem:
for all Israel were come to Shechem
to make him king.
2 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet
in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled
from the presence of king Solomon,
and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)
3 That they sent and called him.
And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake

grievous service of thy father, and
his heavy yoke which he put upon
us, lighter, and we will serve thee.
5 And he said unto them, Depart
yet for three days, then come again
to me. And the people departed.
6 ¶ And king Rehoboam consulted
with the a old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he
yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?
7 And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a a servant unto
this people this day, and wilt serve
them, and answer them, and speak
good words to them, then they will
be thy servants for ever.
8 But he forsook the counsel of
the a old men, which they had given
him, and consulted with the young
men that were grown up with him,
and which stood before him:
9 And he said unto them, What
counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken
to me, saying, Make the yoke which
thy father did put upon us lighter?
10 And the young men that were
grown up with him spake unto him,
saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto
this people that spake unto thee,
saying, Thy father made our yoke
heavy, but make thou it lighter unto
us; thus shalt thou say unto them,
My little finger shall be thicker than
my father’s loins.
11 And now whereas my father
did lade you with a heavy a yoke,
I will add to your yoke: my father
hath chastised you with whips, but
I will chastise you with b scorpions.
12 ¶ So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,
as the king had appointed, saying,
Come to me again the third day.

men’s counsel that they gave him;

14 And spake to them after the
counsel of the young men, saying,
My father made your yoke heavy,
and I will add to your yoke: my
father also chastised you with
whips, but I will chastise you with
scorpions.
15 Wherefore the king hearkened
not unto the people; for the a cause
was from the Lord, that he might
perform his saying, which the Lord
spake by b Ahijah the Shilonite unto
Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
16 ¶ So when all Israel saw that the
king hearkened not unto them, the
people answered the king, saying,
What portion have we in David?
neither have we inheritance in the
son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel:
now see to thine own house, David.
So Israel a departed unto their tents.
17 But as for the children of Israel
which dwelt in the cities of a Judah,
Rehoboam reigned over them.
18 Then king Rehoboam sent
a 
Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with
stones, that he died. Therefore king
Rehoboam made speed to get him up
to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
19 So a Israel b rebelled against the
house of David unto this day.
20 And it came to pass, when all
Israel heard that Jeroboam was come
again, that they sent and called him
unto the congregation, and made
him king over all Israel: there was
none that a followed the house of
David, but the tribe of b Judah only.
21 ¶ And when a Rehoboam was
come to Jerusalem, he assembled all
the house of Judah, with the tribe
of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which
were warriors, to fight against the
house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of
Solomon.

22 But the word of God came unto
Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
23 Speak unto Rehoboam, the son
of Solomon, king of Judah, and
unto all the house of Judah and
Benjamin, and to the remnant of
the people, saying,
24 Thus saith the Lord, Ye shall
not go up, nor fight against your
a 
brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this
thing is from me. They hearkened
therefore to the word of the Lord,
and returned to depart, according
to the word of the Lord.
25 ¶ Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt
therein; and went out from thence,
and built Penuel.
26 And Jeroboam said in his heart,
Now shall the kingdom return to
the house of David:
27 If this people a go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at
Jerusalem, then shall the heart of
this people turn again unto their
lord, even unto Rehoboam king
of Judah, and they shall kill me,
and go again to Rehoboam king of
Judah.
28 Whereupon the king took counsel, and a made two b calves of gold,
and said unto them, It is too much
for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold
thy c gods, O Israel, which brought
thee up out of the land of Egypt.
29 And he set the one in Beth-el,
and the other put he in a Dan.
30 And this thing became a sin: for
the people went to worship before
the one, even unto Dan.
31 And he made an a house of high
places, and made b priests of the
lowest of the people, which were
not of the sons of Levi.
32 And Jeroboam ordained a feast
in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto
the a feast that is in Judah, and he

offered upon the altar. So did he in
Beth-el, sacrificing unto the calves
that he had made: and he placed
in Beth-el the b priests of the high
places which he had made.
33 So he offered upon the altar
which he had made in Beth-el the
fifteenth day of the eighth month,
even in the month which he had
devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children
of Israel: and he offered upon the
altar, and burnt incense.
Chapter 13
Jeroboam is smitten and then healed
by a prophet from Judah—The prophet
delivers his message, is led astray
by a prophet from Bethel, and is
slain by a lion for his disobedience—
Jeroboam continues false worship in
Israel.
And, behold, there came a man of
God out of Judah by the word of
the Lord unto Beth-el: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn
incense.
2 And he cried against the altar
in the word of the Lord, and said,
O altar, altar, thus saith the Lord;
Behold, a child shall be born unto
the house of David, Josiah by name;
and upon thee shall he offer the
priests of the a high places that burn
incense upon thee, and men’s bones
shall be b burnt upon thee.
3 And he gave a sign the same
day, saying, This is the sign which
the Lord hath spoken; Behold, the
altar shall be a rent, and the ashes
that are upon it shall be poured out.
4 And it came to pass, when king
Jeroboam heard the saying of the
man of God, which had cried against
the altar in Beth-el, that he put
forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand,
which he put forth against him,

dried up, so that he could not pull

5 The altar also was rent, and the
ashes poured out from the altar,
according to the sign which the
man of God had given by the word
of the Lord.
6 And the king answered and said
unto the man of God, Entreat now
the face of the Lord thy God, and
pray for me, that my hand may be
restored me again. And the man
of God besought the Lord, and the
king’s hand was restored him again,
and became as it was before.
7 And the king said unto the man
of God, Come home with me, and
refresh thyself, and I will give thee
a reward.
8 And the man of God said unto
the king, If thou wilt give me half
thine house, I will not go in with
thee, neither will I eat bread nor
drink water in this place:
9 For so was it charged me by the
word of the Lord, saying, Eat no
bread, nor drink water, nor turn
again by the same way that thou
camest.
10 So he went another way, and
returned not by the way that he
came to Beth-el.
11 ¶ Now there dwelt an old
prophet in Beth-el; and his sons
came and told him all the works
that the man of God had done that
day in Beth-el: the words which he
had spoken unto the king, them
they told also to their father.
12 And their father said unto
them, What way went he? For his
sons had seen what way the man of
God went, which came from Judah.
13 And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him
the ass: and he rode thereon,
14 And went after the man of God,
and found him sitting under an oak:
and he said unto him, Art thou the
man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.

16 And he said, I may not return

17 For it was said to me by the

no bread nor drink water there, nor
turn again to go by the way that

18 He said unto him, I am a prophet
also as thou art; and an a angel spake
unto me by the word of the Lord,
saying, Bring him back with thee
into thine house, that he may eat
bread and b drink water. But he lied
unto him.
19 So he went back with him, and
did eat bread in his house, and
drank water.
20 ¶ And it came to pass, as they
sat at the table, that the word of the
Lord came unto the prophet that
brought him back:
21 And he cried unto the man of
God that came from Judah, saying,
Thus saith the Lord, Forasmuch
as thou hast a disobeyed the mouth
of the Lord, and hast not kept the
commandment which the Lord thy
God commanded thee,
22 But camest back, and hast eaten
bread and drunk water in the place,
of the which the Lord did say to
thee, Eat no bread, and drink no
water; thy carcase shall not come
unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.
23 ¶ And it came to pass, after he
had eaten bread, and after he had
drunk, that he saddled for him the
ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he
had brought back.
24 And when he was gone, a lion
met him by the way, and slew him:
and his carcase was cast in the way,
and the ass stood by it, the lion also
stood by the carcase.
25 And, behold, men passed by,
and saw the carcase cast in the way,
and the lion standing by the carcase:
and they came and told it in the city
where the old prophet dwelt.

heard thereof, he said, It is the man
of God, who was disobedient unto
the word of the Lord: therefore the
Lord hath delivered him unto the
lion, which hath torn him, and slain
him, according to the word of the
Lord, which he spake unto him.
27 And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they
saddled him.
28 And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and
the lion standing by the carcase: the
lion had not eaten the carcase, nor
torn the ass.
29 And the prophet took up the
carcase of the man of God, and
laid it upon the ass, and brought it
back: and the old prophet came to
the city, to mourn and to bury him.
30 And he laid his carcase in his
own a grave; and they mourned over
him, saying, Alas, my brother!
31 And it came to pass, after he
had buried him, that he spake to his
sons, saying, When I am dead, then
bury me in the sepulchre wherein
the man of God is buried; lay my
bones beside his bones:
32 For the saying which he cried
by the word of the Lord against the
altar in Beth-el, and against all the
houses of the high places which are
in the cities of Samaria, shall surely
come to pass.
33 ¶ After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but
made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him,
and he became one of the priests of
the high places.
34 And this thing became a sin unto
the house of Jeroboam, even to cut
it off, and to destroy it from off the
face of the earth.

of their idolatry—Jeroboam dies and
Nadab reigns—Judah, under Rehoboam,
turns to wickedness—Shishak of Egypt
takes treasures from the temple—Rehoboam dies and Abijam reigns.
At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
2 And Jeroboam said to his wife,
Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be
the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee
to Shiloh: behold, there is a Ahijah
the prophet, which told me that I
should be king over this people.
3 And take with thee ten loaves,
and a cracknels, and a cruse of honey,
and go to him: he shall tell thee what
shall become of the child.
4 And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and
arose, and went to Shiloh, and came
to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah
could not see; for his eyes were set
by reason of his age.
5 ¶ And the Lord said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam
cometh to ask a thing of thee for her
son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt
thou say unto her: for it shall be,
when she cometh in, that she shall
feign herself to be another woman.
6 And it was so, when Ahijah heard
the sound of her feet, as she came in
at the door, that he said, Come in,
thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest
thou thyself to be another? for I am
sent to thee with heavy tidings.
7 Go, tell a Jeroboam, Thus saith
the Lord God of Israel, Forasmuch
as I exalted thee from among the
people, and made thee prince over
my people Israel,
8 And rent the kingdom away
from the house of David, and gave
it thee: and yet thou hast not been

and hast cast me behind thy back:
10 Therefore, behold, I will bring

and will cut off from Jeroboam
him that pisseth against the wall,
and him that is shut up and left
in Israel, and will b take away the

was forty and one years old when
he began to reign, and he reigned

Shishak king of Egypt came up

of the house of the Lord, and the
treasures of the king’s house; he
even took away all: and he took
away all the shields of gold which
Solomon had made.
27 And king Rehoboam made in
their stead brasen shields, and committed them unto the hands of the
chief of the guard, which kept the
door of the king’s house.
28 And it was so, when the king
went into the house of the Lord, that
the guard bare them, and brought
them back into the guard chamber.
29 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of
Rehoboam, and all that he did, are

30 And there was war between
Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their
days.

And there was war between Abijam
and Jeroboam.
8 And Abijam slept with his

reigned in his stead.
9 ¶ And in the twentieth year of
Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa
over Judah.
10 And forty and one years reigned
he in Jerusalem. And his a mother’s
name was Maachah, the daughter
of Abishalom.
11 And Asa did that which was right
in the eyes of the Lord, a as did David his father.
12 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all
the idols that his fathers had made.
13 And also Maachah his mother,
even her he removed from being
queen, because she had made an
idol a in a grove; and Asa destroyed
her idol, and burnt it by the brook
Kidron.

days.

15 And he brought in the things
which his father had dedicated, and
the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the Lord,
silver, and gold, and vessels.
16 ¶ And there was war between
Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
their days.
17 And Baasha king of Israel went
up against Judah, and built Ramah,
that he might not suffer any to go
out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
18 Then Asa took all the a silver and
the gold that were left in the treasures
of the house of the Lord, and the
treasures of the king’s house, and
delivered them into the hand of his
servants: and king Asa sent them to
b 
Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimon,
the son of Hezion, king of c Syria,
that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
19 There is a league between me
and thee, and between my father
and thy father: behold, I have sent
unto thee a present of silver and
gold; come and break thy league
with Baasha king of Israel, that he
may depart from me.
20 So Ben-hadad hearkened unto
king Asa, and sent the captains of
the hosts which he had against the
cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and
Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and
all Cinneroth, with all the land of
Naphtali.
21 And it came to pass, when
Baasha heard thereof, that he left
off building of Ramah, and dwelt
in Tirzah.
22 Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah;
none was exempted: and they took
away the stones of Ramah, and the
timber thereof, wherewith Baasha
had builded; and king Asa built
with them Geba of Benjamin, and
Mizpah.

and all his might, and all that he
did, and the cities which he built,

are they not written in the book of
the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his
old age he was diseased in his feet.
24 And Asa slept with his fathers,
and was buried with his fathers in
the city of David his father: and
a 
Jehoshaphat his son reigned in
his stead.
25 ¶ And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in
the second year of Asa king of Judah,
and reigned over Israel two years.
26 And he did a evil in the sight of
the Lord, and walked in the way
of his father, and in his b sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
27 ¶ And Baasha the son of Ahijah,
of the house of Issachar, conspired
against him; and Baasha smote him
at Gibbethon, which belonged to the
Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel
laid siege to Gibbethon.
28 Even in the third year of Asa
king of Judah did Baasha slay him,
and reigned in his stead.
29 And it came to pass, when he
reigned, that he smote all the house
of  a Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam
any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the
saying of the Lord, which he spake
by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:
30 Because of the sins of Jeroboam
which he sinned, and which he
made Israel sin, by his provocation
wherewith he provoked the Lord
God of Israel to a anger.
31 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of
Nadab, and all that he did, are they
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
32 And there was war between
Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
their days.
33 In the third year of Asa king
of Judah began Baasha the son of
Ahijah to reign over all Israel in
Tirzah, twenty and four years.

the Lord, and walked in the way
of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
Chapter 16
Jehu prophesies evil upon Baasha and
his house—Elah, Zimri, Omri, and
Ahab reign in wickedness—Zimri destroys the house of Baasha—Ahab
marries Jezebel, worships Baal, and
provokes the Lord to anger.
Then the word of the Lord came
to Jehu the son of Hanani against
Baasha, saying,
2 Forasmuch as I exalted thee out
of the dust, and made thee prince
over my people Israel; and thou hast
walked in the way of Jeroboam,
and hast made my people Israel to
a 
sin, to provoke me to anger with
their sins;
3 Behold, I will take away the posterity of a Baasha, and the posterity
of his house; and will make thy
house like the house of Jeroboam
the son of Nebat.
4 Him that dieth of Baasha in the
city shall the dogs eat; and him that
dieth of his in the fields shall the
fowls of the air eat.
5 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha,
and what he did, and his might, are
they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel?
6 So Baasha slept with his fathers,
and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah
his son reigned in his stead.
7 And also by the hand of the
prophet Jehu the son of Hanani
came the word of the Lord against
Baasha, and against his house, even
for all the evil that he did in the
sight of the Lord, in a provoking him
to anger with the work of his hands,
in being like the house of Jeroboam;
and because he killed him.
8 ¶ In the twenty and sixth year of
Asa king of Judah began Elah the
son of Baasha to reign over Israel
in Tirzah, two years.
9 And his servant Zimri, captain of
half his chariots, conspired against
16	2	a	 D&C 121:39.
	3	a	 2 Kgs. 9:9.

him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking
himself drunk in the house of Arza
steward of his house in Tirzah.
10 And a Zimri went in and smote
him, and killed him, in the twenty
and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
11 ¶ And it came to pass, when
he began to reign, as soon as he sat
on his throne, that he slew all the
house of Baasha: he left him not one
that pisseth against a wall, neither
of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.
12 Thus did Zimri destroy all
the house of Baasha, according to
the word of the Lord, which he
spake against Baasha by Jehu the
prophet,
13 For all the sins of Baasha, and
the sins of Elah his son, by which
they sinned, and by which they
a 
made Israel to sin, in provoking
the Lord God of Israel to anger
with their vanities.
14 Now the rest of the acts of Elah,
and all that he did, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
15 ¶ In the twenty and seventh
year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri
reign seven days in Tirzah. And
the people were encamped against
Gibbethon, which belonged to the
Philistines.
16 And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king:
wherefore all Israel made Omri, the
captain of the host, king over Israel
that day in the camp.
17 And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and
they besieged Tirzah.
18 And it came to pass, when Zimri
saw that the city was taken, that he
went into the palace of the king’s
house, and burnt the king’s house
over him with fire, and died,
19 For his sins which he sinned in
doing evil in the sight of the Lord,
in walking in the way of Jeroboam,
and in his sin which he did, to make
Israel to sin.

20 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri,
and his treason that he wrought, are
they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel?
21 ¶ Then were the people of Israel a divided into two parts: half of
the people followed Tibni the son
of Ginath, to make him king; and
half followed Omri.
22 But the people that followed
Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of
Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri
reigned.
23 ¶ In the thirty and first year of
Asa king of Judah began Omri to
reign over Israel, twelve years: six
years reigned he in Tirzah.
24 And he bought the hill a Samaria
of Shemer for two talents of silver,
and built on the hill, and called the
name of the city which he built,
after the name of Shemer, owner
of the hill, Samaria.
25 ¶ But a Omri wrought b evil in
the eyes of the Lord, and did worse
than all that were before him.
26 For he walked in all the way of
a 
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in
his sin wherewith he made Israel
to b sin, to provoke the Lord God of
Israel to anger with their vanities.
27 Now the rest of the acts of Omri
which he did, and his might that
he shewed, are they not written in
the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Israel?
28 So Omri slept with his fathers,
and was buried in Samaria: and
Ahab his son reigned in his stead.
29 ¶ And in the thirty and eighth
year of Asa king of Judah began
Ahab the son of Omri to reign over
Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri

30 And a Ahab the son of Omri did

evil in the sight of the Lord above

31 And it came to pass, as if it had

in the sins of Jeroboam the son of
Nebat, that he took to a wife b Jezebel
the daughter of Ethbaal king of the
Zidonians, and went and served

brook Cherith, that is b before Jordan.
4 And it shall be, that thou shalt
drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee
there.
5 So he went and did according
unto the word of the Lord: for he
went and dwelt by the brook Cherith,
that is before Jordan.
6 And the ravens brought him
bread and flesh in the morning,
and bread and flesh in the evening;
and he drank of the brook.
7 And it came to pass after a while,
that the brook dried up, because
there had been no rain in the land.
8 ¶ And the word of the Lord
came unto him, saying,
9 Arise, get thee to Zarephath,
which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell
there: behold, I have commanded a
a 
widow woman there to sustain thee.
10 So he arose and went to Zare­
phath. And when he came to the
gate of the city, behold, the widow
woman was there gathering of sticks:
and he called to her, and said, Fetch
me, I pray thee, a little water in a
vessel, that I may drink.
11 And as she was going to fetch
it, he called to her, and said, Bring
me, I pray thee, a morsel of a bread
in thine hand.
12 And she said, As the Lord thy
God liveth, I have not a cake, but
an handful of meal in a barrel, and
a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I
am gathering two sticks, that I may
go in and dress it for me and my
son, that we may eat it, and die.
13 And Elijah said unto her, Fear
not; go and do as thou hast said:
but make me thereof a little cake
first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.
14 For thus saith the Lord God of
Israel, The barrel of meal shall not

15 And she a went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and
she, and he, and her house, did eat
many days.
16 And the barrel of meal wasted
not, neither did the cruse of oil fail,
according to the word of the Lord,
which he spake by Elijah.
17 ¶ And it came to pass after these
things, that the son of the woman,
the mistress of the house, fell sick;
and his a sickness was so sore, that
there was no breath left in him.
18 And she said unto Elijah, What
have I to do with thee, O thou man
of God? art thou come unto me to
call my a sin to remembrance, and
to slay my son?
19 And he said unto her, Give me
thy son. And he took him out of her
bosom, and carried him up into a
loft, where he abode, and laid him
upon his own bed.
20 And he cried unto the Lord, and
said, O Lord my God, hast thou also
brought evil upon the widow with
whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?
21 And he a stretched himself upon
the child three times, and cried
unto the Lord, and said, O Lord
my God, I pray thee, let this child’s
b 
soul come into him again.
22 And the Lord heard the voice
of Elijah; and the soul of the
child came into him again, and he
a 
revived.
23 And Elijah took the child, and
brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered
him unto his mother: and Elijah
said, See, thy a son liveth.
24 ¶ And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou
art a man of God, and that the word
of the Lord in thy mouth is truth.

Chapter 18

Elijah is sent to meet Ahab—Obadiah
saves a hundred prophets and meets
Elijah—Elijah challenges the prophets
of Baal to call down fire from heaven—
They fail—He calls down fire, slays the
prophets of Baal, and opens the heavens for rain.
And it came to pass after many days,
that the word of the Lord came to
Elijah in the third year, saying, Go,
shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will
send rain upon the earth.
2 And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore
famine in Samaria.
3 And Ahab called Obadiah, which
was the governor of his house. (Now
Obadiah a feared the Lord greatly:
4 For it was so, when a Jezebel b cut
off the prophets of the Lord, that
Obadiah took an hundred prophets,
and hid them by fifty in a cave, and
fed them with bread and water.)
5 And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go
into the land, unto all fountains of
water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save
the horses and mules alive, that we
lose not all the beasts.
6 So they divided the land between
them to pass throughout it: Ahab
went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
7 ¶ And as Obadiah was in the
way, behold, Elijah met him: and he
knew him, and fell on his face, and
said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?
8 And he answered him, I am: go,
tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
9 And he said, What have I sinned,
that thou wouldest deliver thy
servant into the hand of Ahab, to
slay me?
10 As the Lord thy God liveth,
there is no nation or kingdom,
whither my lord hath not sent to
seek thee: and when they said, He
is not there; he took an oath of the

kingdom and nation, that they
found thee not.
11 And now thou sayest, Go, tell
thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
12 And it shall come to pass, as
soon as I am gone from thee, that
the Spirit of the Lord shall a carry
thee whither I know not; and so
when I come and tell Ahab, and
he cannot find thee, he shall slay
me: but I thy servant fear the Lord
from my youth.
13 Was it not told my lord what I
did when Jezebel a slew the prophets
of the Lord, how I hid an hundred
men of the Lord’s prophets by fifty
in a cave, and fed them with bread
and water?
14 And now thou sayest, Go, tell
thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and
he shall slay me.
15 And Elijah said, As the Lord of
hosts liveth, before whom I stand,
I will surely shew myself unto him
to day.
16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab,
and told him: and Ahab went to
meet Elijah.
17 ¶ And it came to pass, when
Ahab saw Elijah, that a Ahab said
unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?
18 And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s
house, in that ye have a forsaken the
commandments of the Lord, and
thou hast followed Baalim.
19 Now therefore send, and gather
to me all Israel unto mount Carmel,
and the a prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of
the groves four hundred, which eat
at Jezebel’s table.
20 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the
a 
prophets together unto mount
Carmel.

people, and said, How long halt ye

be God, b follow him: but if Baal,
then follow him. And the people
answered him not a word.
22 Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet
of the Lord; but Baal’s prophets are
four hundred and fifty men.
23 Let them therefore give us two
bullocks; and let them choose one
bullock for themselves, and cut it in
pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no
fire under: and I will dress the other
bullock, and lay it on wood, and
put no fire under:
24 And call ye on the name of your
gods, and I will call on the name of
the Lord: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all
the people answered and said, It is
well spoken.
25 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock
for yourselves, and dress it first;
for ye are many; and call on the
name of your a gods, but put no fire
under.
26 And they took the bullock
which was given them, and they
dressed it, and called on the name
of Baal from morning even until
noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But
there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the
altar which was made.
27 And it came to pass at noon,
that Elijah mocked them, and said,
Cry aloud: for he is a god; either
he is talking, or he is a pursuing, or
he is in a journey, or peradventure
he sleepeth, and must be awaked.
28 And they cried aloud, and a cut
themselves after their manner with
knives and lancets, till the blood
gushed out upon them.
29 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied
until the time of the offering of the

any that regarded.

people, Come near unto me. And
all the people came near unto him.
And he repaired the altar of the
Lord that was broken down.
31 And Elijah took a twelve stones,
according to the number of the
tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto
whom the word of the Lord came,
saying, b Israel shall be thy name:
32 And with the stones he built
an altar in the name of the Lord:
and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two
measures of seed.
33 And he put the wood in order,
and cut the bullock in pieces, and
laid him on the wood, and said, Fill

it on the burnt sacrifice, and on

also with water.

at thy word.

40 And Elijah said unto them, Take
the prophets of Baal; let not one of
them escape. And they took them:
and Elijah brought them down to
the brook Kishon, and slew them
there.
41 ¶ And Elijah said unto Ahab,
Get thee up, eat and drink; for there
is a sound of abundance of rain.
42 So Ahab went up to eat and to
drink. And Elijah went up to the
top of Carmel; and he cast himself
down upon the earth, and put his
face between his knees,
43 And said to his servant, Go up
now, look toward the sea. And he
went up, and looked, and said, There
is nothing. And he said, Go again
seven times.
44 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold,
there ariseth a little cloud out of
the sea, like a man’s hand. And he
said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare
thy chariot, and get thee down, that
the rain stop thee not.
45 And it came to pass in the mean
while, that the heaven was black
with clouds and wind, and there
was a great rain. And Ahab rode,
and went to Jezreel.
46 And the a hand of the Lord was
on Elijah; and he b girded up his
loins, and ran before Ahab to the
entrance of Jezreel.

Jezebel seeks the life of Elijah—An

And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he
had slain all the prophets with the
sword.
2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger
unto Elijah, saying, So let the a gods

them by to morrow about this time.
3 And when he saw that, he arose,
and went for his life, and came to
Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah,
and left his servant there.
4 ¶ But he himself went a day’s
journey into the wilderness, and
came and sat down under a a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It
is enough; now, O Lord, take away
my life; for I am not better than
my fathers.
5 And as he lay and slept under a
juniper tree, behold, then an a angel
touched him, and said unto him,
Arise and eat.
6 And he looked, and, behold, there
was a cake baken on the coals, and
a cruse of water at his head. And
he did eat and drink, and laid him
down again.
7 And the angel of the Lord
came again the second time, and
touched him, and said, Arise and
eat; because the journey is too great
for thee.
8 And he arose, and did eat and
drink, and went in the strength of

and he said unto him, What doest
thou here, Elijah?
10 And he said, I have been very
jealous for the Lord God of hosts:
for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down
thine altars, and slain thy prophets
with the sword; and I, even I only,
am left; and they a seek my life, to
take it away.

the rocks before the Lord; but the
Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the
Lord was not in the earthquake:
12 And after the earthquake a
fire; but the Lord was not in the
fire: and after the fire a a still small
b 
voice.
13 And it was so, when Elijah heard
it, that he wrapped his face in his
mantle, and went out, and stood in
the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him,
and said, What doest thou here,
Elijah?
14 And he said, I have been very
a 
jealous for the Lord God of hosts:
because the children of Israel have
forsaken thy covenant, thrown down

15 And the Lord said unto him,
Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when
thou comest, anoint Hazael to be
a 
king over Syria:
16 And Jehu the son of Nimshi
shalt thou a anoint to be king over Israel: and b Elisha the son of Shaphat
of Abel-meholah shalt thou c anoint
to be prophet in thy room.
17 And it shall come to pass, that
him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that
escapeth from the sword of Jehu
shall Elisha slay.
18 Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which
have not bowed unto Baal, and every
mouth which hath not kissed him.
19 ¶ So he departed thence, and
found Elisha the son of Shaphat,
who was plowing with twelve yoke
of oxen before him, and he with the
twelfth: and Elijah passed by him,
and cast his a mantle upon him.

thee, kiss my father and my mother,
and then I will a follow thee. And he
said unto him, Go back again: for
what have I done to thee?
21 And he returned back from him,
and took a yoke of oxen, and slew
them, and boiled their flesh with
the instruments of the oxen, and
gave unto the people, and they did
eat. Then he arose, and went after
Elijah, and ministered unto him.

Benhadad of Syria makes war with Israel—The Syrians are defeated twice—
Ahab lets Benhadad go free, contrary
to the will of the Lord.
And Ben-hadad the king of Syria
gathered all his host together: and
there were thirty and two kings with
him, and horses, and chariots: and
he went up and besieged Samaria,
and warred against it.
2 And he sent messengers to Ahab
king of Israel into the city, and said
unto him, Thus saith a Ben-hadad,
3 Thy a silver and thy gold is mine;
thy wives also and thy children,
even the goodliest, are mine.
4 And the king of Israel answered
and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I am thine, and
all that I have.
5 And the messengers came again,
and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad,
saying, Although I have sent unto
thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me
thy silver, and thy gold, and thy
wives, and thy children;
6 Yet I will send my servants unto
thee to morrow about this time, and
they shall search thine house, and

their hand, and take it away.

7 Then the king of Israel called
all the elders of the land, and said,
Mark, I pray you, and see how
this man a seeketh mischief: for he
sent unto me for my wives, and
for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied
him not.
8 And all the elders and all the
people said unto him, Hearken not
unto him, nor consent.
9 Wherefore he said unto the
messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my
lord the king, All that thou didst
send for to thy servant at the first
I will do: but this thing I may not
do. And the messengers departed,
and brought him word again.
10 And Ben-hadad sent unto him,
and said, The a gods do so unto me,
and more also, if the dust of Samaria
shall suffice for handfuls for all the
people that follow me.
11 And the king of Israel answered
and said, Tell him, Let not him that
girdeth on his a harness b boast himself as he that putteth it off.
12 And it came to pass, when Benhadad heard this message, as he was
drinking, he and the kings in the
a 
pavilions, that he said unto his
servants, Set yourselves in array. And
they set themselves in array against
the city.
13 ¶ And, behold, there came a
prophet unto Ahab king of Israel,
saying, Thus saith the Lord, Hast
thou seen all this great multitude?
behold, I will deliver it into thine
hand this day; and thou shalt know
that I am the Lord.
14 And Ahab said, By whom? And
he said, Thus saith the Lord, Even
by the a young men of the princes of
the b provinces. Then he said, Who
shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.
15 Then he a numbered the young
men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred
and thirty two: and after them he

numbered all the people, even all
the children of Israel, being seven
thousand.
16 And they went out at noon. But
Ben-hadad was drinking himself
drunk in the a pavilions, he and the
kings, the thirty and two kings that
helped him.
17 And the young men of the
princes of the provinces went out
first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and
they told him, saying, There are
men come out of Samaria.
18 And he said, Whether they be
come out for peace, take them alive;
or whether they be come out for
war, take them alive.
19 So these young men of the
princes of the provinces came out
of the city, and the army which
followed them.
20 And they slew every one his
man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel
pursued them: and Ben-hadad the
king of Syria escaped on an horse
with the horsemen.
21 And the king of Israel went out,
and smote the horses and chariots,
and slew the Syrians with a great
slaughter.
22 ¶ And the prophet came to the
king of Israel, and said unto him,
Go, strengthen thyself, and mark,
and see what a thou doest: for at the
return of the year the king of Syria
will come up against thee.
23 And the servants of the king
of Syria said unto him, Their gods
are gods of the hills; therefore they
were stronger than we; but let us
fight against them in the plain,
and surely we shall be stronger
than they.
24 And do this thing, Take the
kings away, every man out of his
place, and put captains in their
rooms:
25 And number thee an army, like
the army that thou hast lost, horse
for horse, and chariot for chariot:
and we will fight against them in the

plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened
unto their voice, and did so.
26 And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad
numbered the Syrians, and went
up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
27 And the children of Israel were
numbered, and a were all present,
and went against them: and the
children of Israel pitched before
them like two little flocks of kids;
but the Syrians filled the country.
28 ¶ And there came a man of God,
and spake unto the king of Israel,
and said, Thus saith the Lord, Because the Syrians have said, The
Lord is God of the hills, but he is
not God of the valleys, therefore
will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall
know that I am the Lord.
29 And they pitched one over
against the other seven days. And
so it was, that in the seventh day
the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians
an hundred thousand footmen in
one day.
30 But the rest fled to Aphek, into
the city; and there a wall fell upon
twenty and seven thousand of the
men that were left. And Ben-hadad
fled, and came into the city, into
an inner chamber.
31 ¶ And his servants said unto
him, Behold now, we have heard
that the kings of the house of Israel
are merciful kings: let us, I pray
thee, put sackcloth on our loins,
and ropes upon our heads, and go
out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.
32 So they girded sackcloth on their
loins, and put ropes on their heads,
and came to the king of Israel, and
said, Thy servant Ben-hadad saith, I
pray thee, let me live. And he said,
Is he yet alive? he is my brother.
33 Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come
from him, and did hastily catch it:

and they said, Thy brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring

up into the chariot.
34 And Ben-hadad said unto him,
The cities, which my father took
from thy father, I will restore; and
thou shalt make a streets for thee
in Damascus, as my father made
in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will
send thee away with this covenant.
So he made a covenant with him,
and sent him away.
35 ¶ And a certain man of the
a 
sons of the prophets said unto his
neighbour in the word of the Lord,
Smite me, I pray thee. And the man
refused to smite him.
36 Then said he unto him, Because
thou hast not obeyed the voice of
the Lord, behold, as soon as thou
art departed from me, a lion shall
slay thee. And as soon as he was
departed from him, a lion found
him, and slew him.
37 Then he found another man,
and said, Smite me, I pray thee.
And the man smote him, so that in
smiting he wounded him.
38 So the prophet departed, and
waited for the king by the way,
and disguised himself with a ashes
upon his face.
39 And as the king passed by, he
cried unto the king: and he said, Thy
servant went out into the midst of
the battle; and, behold, a man turned
aside, and brought a man unto
me, and said, Keep this man: if by
any means he be missing, then shall
thy life be for his life, or else thou
shalt pay a talent of silver.
40 And as thy servant was busy
here and there, he was gone. And
the king of Israel said unto him, So
shall thy judgment be; thyself hast
decided it.
41 And he hasted, and took the
ashes away from his face; and the
king of Israel discerned him that
he was of the prophets.

I appointed to utter destruction,
therefore thy a life shall go for his

43 And the king of Israel went to

and came to Samaria.
Chapter 21
Ahab desires the vineyard of Naboth—
Jezebel arranges for false witnesses, and
Naboth is stoned for blasphemy—Elijah
prophesies that Ahab and Jezebel and
their house will be destroyed.
And it came to pass after these
things, that Naboth the Jezreelite
had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab
king of Samaria.
2 And Ahab spake unto Naboth,
saying, Give me thy vineyard, that
I may have it for a garden of herbs,
because it is near unto my house:
and I will give thee for it a better
vineyard than it; or, if it seem good
to thee, I will give thee the worth
of it in money.
3 And Naboth said to Ahab, The
Lord forbid it me, that I should
give the a inheritance of my fathers
unto thee.
4 And Ahab came into his house
heavy and displeased because of the
word which Naboth the Jezreelite
had spoken to him: for he had said,
I will not give thee the inheritance
of my fathers. And he laid him down
upon his bed, and turned away his
face, and would eat no bread.
5 ¶ But Jezebel his wife came to him,
and said unto him, Why is thy spirit
so sad, that thou eatest no bread?
6 And he said unto her, Because I
spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite,
and said unto him, Give me thy
vineyard for money; or else, if it
please thee, I will give thee another
vineyard for it: and he answered,
I will not give thee my vineyard.

7 And Jezebel his wife said unto
him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread,
and let thine heart be merry: I will
give thee the vineyard of Naboth
the Jezreelite.
8 So she wrote letters in Ahab’s
name, and sealed them with his
a 
seal, and sent the letters unto the
elders and to the nobles that were
in his city, dwelling with Naboth.
9 And she wrote in the letters,
saying, Proclaim a a fast, and set
Naboth on high among the people:
10 And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness
a 
against him, saying, Thou didst
b 
blaspheme God and the king. And
then carry him out, and stone him,
that he may die.
11 And the men of his city, even
the elders and the nobles who were
the inhabitants in his city, did as
Jezebel had sent unto them, and as
it was written in the letters which
she had sent unto them.
12 They proclaimed a fast, and set
Naboth on high among the people.
13 And there came in two men,
children of Belial, and sat before
him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against
Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme
God and the king. Then they carried
him forth out of the city, and stoned
him with stones, that he died.
14 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
15 ¶ And it came to pass, when Jez­
ebel heard that Naboth was stoned,
and was dead, that Jezebel said to
Ahab, Arise, take a possession of the
vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite,
which he refused to give thee for
money: for Naboth is not alive,
but dead.
16 And it came to pass, when Ahab
heard that Naboth was dead, that
Ahab rose up to go down to the
vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite,
to take possession of it.

17 ¶ And the word of the Lord
came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
18 Arise, go down to meet Ahab
king of Israel, which is in Samaria:
behold, he is in the vineyard of
Naboth, whither he is gone down
to possess it.
19 And thou shalt speak unto him,
saying, Thus saith the Lord, Hast
thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto
him, saying, Thus saith the Lord,
In the place where dogs licked the
blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy
blood, even thine.
20 And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast
thou found me, O mine enemy ?
And he answered, I have found thee:
because thou hast sold thyself to
work evil in the sight of the Lord.
21 Behold, I will bring evil upon
thee, and will take away thy a posterity, and will cut off from Ahab
him that pisseth against the wall,
and him that is shut up and left
in Israel,
22 And will make thine house like
the house of Jeroboam the son of
Nebat, and like the house of Baasha
the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel
to sin.
23 And of Jezebel also spake the
Lord, saying, The a dogs shall eat
Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.
24 Him that dieth of Ahab in the
city the dogs shall eat; and him that
dieth in the field shall the fowls of
the air eat.
25 ¶ But there was none like unto
Ahab, which did sell himself to work
wickedness in the sight of the Lord,
whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.
26 And he did very a abominably
in following idols, according to all
things as did the Amorites, whom
the Lord cast out before the children of Israel.
27 And it came to pass, when Ahab
heard those words, that he a rent his
clothes, and put sackcloth upon his

flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went b softly.
28 And the word of the Lord came
to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
29 Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because
he humbleth himself before me, I
will not bring the evil in his days:
but in his son’s days will I bring the
evil upon his house.
Chapter 22
Jehoshaphat of Judah and Ahab of Israel
join forces against Syria—Ahab’s prophets foretell success—Micaiah foretells
the defeat and death of Ahab—Ahab
is slain and dogs lick up his blood—
Jehoshaphat reigns in righteousness in
Judah—Ahaziah reigns in Israel and
serves Baal.
And they continued three years
without war between Syria and
Israel.
2 And it came to pass in the third
year, that Jehoshaphat the king of
Judah came down to the king of
Israel.
3 And the king of Israel said unto
his servants, Know ye that Ramoth
in Gilead is ours, and we be still,
and take it not out of the hand of
the king of Syria?
4 And he said unto Jehoshaphat,
Wilt thou go with me to battle to
Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat
said to the king of Israel, a I am as
thou art, my people as thy people,
my horses as thy horses.
5 And Jehoshaphat said unto the
king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee,
at the word of the Lord to day.
6 Then the king of Israel gathered
the a prophets together, about four
hundred men, and said unto them,
Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to
battle, or shall I forbear? And they
said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king.

8 And the king of Israel said unto
Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man,
Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom
we may inquire of the Lord: but I
a 
hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.
And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the
king say so.
9 Then the king of Israel called
an officer, and said, Hasten hither
Micaiah the son of Imlah.
10 And the king of Israel and
Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat
each on his throne, having put on
their robes, in a a void place in the
entrance of the gate of Samaria;
and all the prophets prophesied
before them.
11 And Zedekiah the son of Che­
naanah made him horns of iron: and
he said, Thus saith the Lord, With
these shalt thou push the Syrians,
until thou have consumed them.
12 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the Lord
shall deliver it into the king’s hand.
13 And the messenger that was
gone to call Micaiah spake unto him,
saying, Behold now, the words of
the prophets declare good unto the
king with one mouth: let thy word, I
pray thee, be like the word of one of
them, and speak that which is good.
14 And Micaiah said, As the Lord
liveth, what the Lord saith unto
me, that will I speak.
15 ¶ So he came to the king. And
the king said unto him, Micaiah,
shall we go against Ramoth-gilead
to battle, or shall we forbear? And
he answered him, Go, and prosper:
for the Lord shall deliver it into the
hand of the king.
16 And the king said unto him, How
many times shall I adjure thee that
thou tell me nothing but that which
is true in the name of the Lord?
17 And he said, I saw all Israel
a 
scattered upon the hills, as b sheep
that have not a shepherd: and the
Lord said, These have no master:

let them return every man to his
house in peace.
18 And the king of Israel said unto
Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee
that he would prophesy no good
concerning me, but evil?
19 And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the Lord: I saw the
Lord sitting on his throne, and all
the host of heaven standing by him
on his right hand and on his left.
20 And the Lord said, Who shall
persuade Ahab, that he may go up
and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one
said on this manner, and another
said on that manner.
21 And there came forth a spirit,
and stood before the Lord, and
said, I will persuade him.
22 And the Lord said unto him,
Wherewith? And he said, I will go
forth, and I will be a a lying spirit in
the mouth of all his prophets. And
he said, Thou shalt persuade him,
and prevail also: go forth, and do so.
23 Now therefore, behold, the
Lord hath put a a lying spirit in
the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil
concerning thee.
24 But Zedekiah the son of Che­
naanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which
way went the Spirit of the Lord
from me to speak unto thee?
25 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou
shalt see in that day, when thou
shalt go into an inner chamber to
hide thyself.
26 And the king of Israel said, Take
Micaiah, and carry him back unto
Amon the governor of the city, and
to Joash the king’s son;
27 And say, Thus saith the king,
Put this fellow in the prison, and
feed him with bread of affliction
and with water of affliction, until
I come in peace.
28 And Micaiah said, If thou return
at all in peace, the Lord hath not
spoken by me. And he said, Heark­en,
O people, every one of you.

29 So the king of Israel and Jehosh­
aphat the king of Judah went up to
Ramoth-gilead.
30 And the king of Israel said unto
Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself,
and enter into the battle; but put
thou on thy robes. And the king of
Israel disguised himself, and went
into the battle.
31 But the king of  Syria commanded
his thirty and two captains that had
rule over his chariots, saying, Fight
neither with small nor great, save
only with the king of Israel.
32 And it came to pass, when the
captains of the chariots saw Jehosh­
aphat, that they said, Surely it is
the king of Israel. And they turned
aside to fight against him: and Jeho­
shaphat cried out.
33 And it came to pass, when the
captains of the chariots perceived
that it was not the king of Israel,
that they turned back from pursuing him.
34 And a certain man drew a bow
at a venture, and smote the king
of Israel a between the joints of the
harness: wherefore he said unto the
driver of his chariot, Turn thine
hand, and carry me out of the host;
for I am wounded.
35 And the battle increased that
day: and the king was a stayed up
in his chariot against the Syrians,
and died at even: and the blood ran
out of the wound into the midst of
the chariot.
36 And there went a proclamation
throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every
man to his city, and every man to
his own country.
37 ¶ So the king a died, and was
brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.
38 And one washed the chariot
in the pool of Samaria; and the
dogs licked up his blood; and they
washed his armour; according unto

spake.
39 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab,
and all that he did, and the a ivory
house which he made, and all the
cities that he built, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
40 So Ahab slept with his fathers;
and Ahaziah his son reigned in his
stead.
41 ¶ And Jehoshaphat the son of
Asa began to reign over Judah in the
fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
42 Jehoshaphat was thirty and five
years old when he began to reign;
and he reigned twenty and five years
in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name
was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
43 And he walked in all the ways
of Asa his father; he turned not aside
from it, doing that which was right
in the eyes of the Lord: nevertheless the high places were not taken
away; for the people offered and
burnt incense yet in the high places.
44 And Jehoshaphat made peace
with the king of Israel.
45 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he
shewed, and how he warred, are
they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Judah?
46 And the remnant of the a sodomites, which remained in the days
of his father Asa, he took out of
the land.
47 There was then no a  king in
Edom: a deputy was king.
48 Jehoshaphat made ships of
Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold:
but they went not; for the ships
were broken at a Ezion-geber.
49 Then said Ahaziah the son of
Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the
ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.

his fathers, and was buried with

in his stead.
51 ¶ Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria
the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned
two years over Israel.
52 And he did evil in the sight of the

Lord, and walked in the way of his
father, and in the way of his mother,
and in the way of Jeroboam the son
of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:
53 For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger
the Lord God of Israel, according
to all that his father had done.

hen a Moab rebelled against
Israel after the death of Ahab.
2 And Ahaziah fell down
through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was
sick: and he sent messengers, and
said unto them, Go, inquire of a Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I
shall recover of this disease.
3 But the angel of the Lord said
to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up
to meet the messengers of the king
of Samaria, and say unto them, Is
it not because there is not a God in
Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?
4 Now therefore thus saith the
Lord, Thou shalt not come down
from that bed on which thou art
gone up, but shalt surely a die. And
Elijah departed.

5 ¶ And when the messengers
turned back unto him, he said unto
them, Why are ye now turned back?
6 And they said unto him, There
came a man up to meet us, and said
unto us, Go, turn again unto the
king that sent you, and say unto
him, Thus saith the Lord, Is it not
because there is not a God in Israel,
that thou sendest to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore
thou shalt not come down from that
bed on which thou art gone up, but
shalt surely die.
7 And he said unto them, What
manner of man was he which came
up to meet you, and told you these
words?
8 And they answered him, He was
an a hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And
he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
9 Then the king sent unto him a
captain of fifty with his fifty. And
he went up to him: and, behold, he
sat on the top of an hill. And he
spake unto him, Thou man of God,
the king hath said, Come down.

10 And Elijah answered and said
to the captain of fifty, If I be a man
of God, then let a fire come down
from heaven, and consume thee and
thy fifty. And there came down fire
from heaven, and consumed him
and his fifty.
11 Again also he sent unto him
another captain of fifty with his
fifty. And he answered and said
unto him, O man of God, thus hath
the king said, Come down quickly.
12 And Elijah answered and said
unto them, If I be a man of God, let
fire come down from heaven, and
consume thee and thy fifty. And the
fire of God came down from heaven,
and consumed him and his fifty.
13 ¶ And he sent again a captain
of the third fifty with his fifty. And
the third captain of fifty went up,
and came and fell on his knees
before Elijah, and besought him,
and said unto him, O man of God,
I pray thee, let my life, and the life
of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.
14 Behold, there came fire down
from heaven, and burnt up the two
captains of the former fifties with
their fifties: therefore let my life
now be precious in thy sight.
15 And the a angel of the Lord said
unto Elijah, Go down with him: be
not afraid of him. And he arose, and
went down with him unto the king.
16 And he said unto him, Thus
saith the Lord, Forasmuch as thou
hast sent messengers to inquire of
Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, is it
not because there is no God in Israel
to inquire of his word? therefore
thou shalt not come down off that
bed on which thou art gone up, but
shalt surely die.
17 ¶ So he a died according to the
word of the Lord which Elijah
had spoken. And b Jehoram reigned
in his stead in the second year of

Chapter 2
Elisha and the prophets know that Elijah
is to be translated—Elijah divides the
waters of the Jordan and is taken up
into heaven in a whirlwind—The mantle
of Elijah falls on Elisha, who also divides the waters of the Jordan—Elisha
heals the waters of Jericho—Youths are
torn by bears for mocking Elisha.
And it came to pass, when the Lord
would take up Elijah into heaven
by a whirlwind, that Elijah went
with a Elisha from b Gilgal.
2 And a Elijah said unto Elisha,
Tarry here, I pray thee; for the
Lord hath sent me to b Beth-el. And
Elisha said unto him, As the Lord
liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will
not c leave thee. So they went down
to Beth-el.
3 And the a sons of the prophets
that were at Beth-el came forth to
Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest
thou that the Lord will take away
thy master from thy head to day ?
And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye
your peace.
4 And Elijah said unto him, Eli­
sha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the
Lord hath sent me to a Jericho. And
he said, As the Lord liveth, and as
thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.
So they came to Jericho.
5 And the sons of the prophets
that were at Jericho came to Elisha,
and said unto him, Knowest thou
that the Lord will take away thy
master from thy head to day ? And
he answered, Yea, I know it; hold
ye your peace.

I pray thee, here; for the Lord hath

the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they
two went on.
7 And fifty men of the sons of the
prophets went, and stood to view afar
off: and they two stood by Jordan.
8 And Elijah took his a mantle,
and wrapped it together, and smote
the b waters, and they were divided
hither and thither, so that they two
went over on dry ground.
9 ¶ And it came to pass, when they
were gone over, that Elijah said unto
Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee,
before I be taken away from thee.
And Elisha said, I pray thee, let
a a double portion of thy spirit be
upon me.
10 And he said, Thou hast asked a
hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see
me when I am taken from thee, it
shall be so unto thee; but if not,
it shall not be so.
11 And it came to pass, as they still
went on, and talked, that, behold,
there appeared a a chariot of fire, and
horses of fire, and parted them both
asunder; and b Elijah went up by a
c 
whirlwind into heaven.
12 ¶ And Elisha saw it, and he
cried, My father, my father, the
chariot of Israel, and the horsemen
thereof. And he saw him no more:
and he took hold of his own clothes,
and rent them in two pieces.
13 He took up also the mantle
of Elijah that fell from him, and
went back, and stood by the bank
of Jordan;
14 And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote
the waters, and said, Where is the
Lord God of Elijah? and when he
also had smitten the waters, they
a 
parted hither and thither: and Eli­
sha went over.

15 And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw
him, they said, The spirit of a Elijah
doth b rest on Elisha. And they came
to meet him, and bowed themselves
to the ground before him.
16 ¶ And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go,
we pray thee, and seek thy master:
lest peradventure the a Spirit of the
Lord hath taken him up, and cast
him upon some mountain, or into
some valley. And he said, Ye shall
not send.
17 And when they urged him till
he was ashamed, he said, Send.
They sent therefore fifty men; and
they sought three days, but found
him not.
18 And when they came again to
him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he
said unto them, Did I not say unto
you, Go not?
19 ¶ And the men of the city said
unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee,
the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water
is naught, and the ground barren.
20 And he said, Bring me a new
a 
cruse, and put salt therein. And
they brought it to him.
21 And he went forth unto the
spring of the waters, and cast the
a 
salt in there, and said, Thus saith
the Lord, I have healed these b waters; there shall not be from thence
any more death or c barren land.
22 So the waters were healed unto
this day, according to the saying of
Elisha which he spake.
23 ¶ And he went up from thence
unto Beth-el: and as he was going
up by the way, there came forth
a 
little children out of the city, and
b 
mocked him, and said unto him,

24 And he turned back, and looked
on them, and cursed them in the
name of the Lord. And there came
forth two she bears out of the wood,
and tare forty and two children of
them.

he returned to Samaria.
Chapter 3
Jehoram of Israel and Jehoshaphat of
Judah join forces against Moab—Elisha
promises them water for their animals
and victory in the war—The Moabites
are defeated.
Now a Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in b Samaria
the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat
king of Judah, and reigned twelve
years.
2 And he wrought a evil in the
sight of the Lord; but not like his
b 
father, and like his mother: for he
put away the c image of d Baal that his

he departed not therefrom.

8 And he said, Which way shall we
go up? And he answered, The way
through the wilderness of Edom.
9 So the king of Israel went, and
the king of Judah, and the a king of
b 
Edom: and they c fetched a compass
of seven days’ journey: and there
was no water for the host, and for
the cattle that followed them.
10 And the king of Israel said, Alas!
that the Lord hath called these three
kings together, to deliver them into
the hand of Moab!
11 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there
not here a prophet of the Lord,
that we may inquire of the Lord by
him? And one of the king of Israel’s
servants answered and said, Here
is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which
poured water on the hands of
Elijah.
12 And Jehoshaphat said, The
word of the Lord is with him. So
the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat
and the king of Edom went down
to him.
13 And Elisha said unto the king
of Israel, What have I to do with

thee? b get thee to the prophets of
thy father, and to the prophets

Lord hath called these three kings
together, to deliver them into the
hand of Moab.
14 And Elisha said, As the Lord of
hosts liveth, before whom I stand,
surely, were it not that I regard the
presence of Jehoshaphat the king
of Judah, I would not look toward
thee, nor see thee.

And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the b hand of the
Lord came upon him.
16 And he said, Thus saith the
Lord, Make this valley full of
ditches.
17 For thus saith the Lord, Ye shall
not see wind, neither shall ye see
rain; yet that valley shall be filled
with water, that ye may drink,
both ye, and your cattle, and your
beasts.
18 And this is but a a light thing in
the sight of the Lord: he will b deliver the c Moabites also into your
hand.
19 And ye shall smite every fenced
city, and every choice city, and shall
fell every good tree, and stop all
wells of water, and mar every good
piece of land with stones.
20 And it came to pass in the
morning, when the meat a offering
was offered, that, behold, there
came water by the way of Edom,
and the country was filled with
water.
21 ¶ And when all the Moabites
heard that the kings were come up
to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on
armour, and upward, and stood in
the border.
22 And they rose up early in the
morning, and the sun shone upon
the water, and the Moabites saw
the water on the other side as red
as blood:
23 And they said, This is blood: the
kings are surely slain, and they have
smitten one another: now therefore,
Moab, to the spoil.
24 And when they came to the
camp of Israel, the Israelites rose
up and smote the Moabites, so that
they fled before them: but they went
forward smiting the Moabites, even
in their country.
25 And they beat down the cities,
and on every good piece of land cast
every man his stone, and filled it;

Ezek. 1:3.

and they stopped all the wells of
water, and felled all the good trees:
only in a Kir-haraseth left they the
stones thereof; howbeit the slingers
went about it, and smote it.
26 ¶ And when the king of Moab
saw that the battle was too sore
for him, he took with him seven
hundred men that drew swords, to
break through even unto the king
of Edom: but they could not.
27 Then he took his eldest son that
should have reigned in his stead,
and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was
great indignation against Israel:
and they departed from him, and
returned to their own land.
Chapter 4
Elisha multiplies the widow’s oil—
He promises a son to a Shunammite
woman—The child dies and is raised to
life by Elisha—He makes the poisonous
food harmless—Bread and grain are
multiplied for the people to eat.
Now there cried a certain woman of
the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou
knowest that thy servant did fear
the Lord: and the a creditor is come
to take unto him my two sons to
be b bondmen.
2 And Elisha said unto her, What
shall I do for thee? tell me, what
hast thou in the house? And she
said, Thine handmaid hath not any
thing in the house, save a pot of oil.
3 Then he said, Go, borrow thee
vessels abroad of all thy neighbours,
even empty vessels; borrow not
a few.
4 And when thou art come in, thou
shalt shut the door upon thee and
upon thy sons, and shalt pour out
into all those vessels, and thou shalt
set aside that which is full.

sons, who brought the vessels to her;
and she poured out.
6 And it came to pass, when the
vessels were full, that she said unto
her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And
he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil a stayed.
7 Then she came and told the man
of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil,
and pay thy debt, and live thou and
thy children of the rest.
8 ¶ And it fell on a day, that Eli­
sha passed to a Shunem, where was a
great b woman; and she constrained
him to eat bread. And so it was, that
as oft as he passed by, he turned in
thither to eat bread.
9 And she said unto her husband,
Behold now, I perceive that this is
an holy man of God, which passeth
by us continually.
10 Let us make a little chamber,
I pray thee, on the wall; and let us
set for him there a bed, and a table,
and a stool, and a candlestick: and
it shall be, when he cometh to us,
that he shall turn in thither.
11 And it fell on a day, that he
came thither, and he turned into
the chamber, and lay there.
12 And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And
when he had called her, she stood
before him.
13 And he said unto him, Say now
unto her, Behold, thou hast been
careful for us with all this care;
what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king,
or to the captain of the host? And
she answered, I dwell among mine
own people.
14 And he said, What then is to be
done for her? And Gehazi answered,
Verily she hath no child, and her
husband is old.
15 And he said, Call her. And
when he had called her, she stood
in the door.
16 And he said, About this season,
according to the a time of life, thou
shalt embrace a son. And she said,
	6	a	 heb  stopped.

Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do
not lie unto thine handmaid.
17 And the a woman conceived,
and bare a son at that season that
Elisha had said unto her, according
to the time of life.
18 ¶ And when the child was
grown, it fell on a day, that he went
out to his father to the reapers.
19 And he said unto his father, My
head, my head. And he said to a lad,
Carry him to his mother.
20 And when he had taken him,
and brought him to his mother,
he sat on her knees till noon, and
then died.
21 And she went up, and laid
him on the bed of the man of God,
and shut the door upon him, and
went out.
22 And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray
thee, one of the young men, and
one of the asses, that I may run to
the man of God, and come again.
23 And he said, Wherefore wilt
thou go to him to day ? it is neither
new moon, nor sabbath. And she
said, It shall be well.
24 Then she saddled an ass, and
said to her servant, Drive, and go
forward; slack not thy riding for
me, except I bid thee.
25 So she went and came unto
the man of God to mount a Carmel.
And it came to pass, when the man
of God saw her afar off, that he
said to Gehazi his servant, Behold,
yonder is that Shunammite:
26 Run now, I pray thee, to meet
her, and say unto her, Is it well with
thee? is it well with thy husband?
is it well with the child? And she
answered, It is well.
27 And when she came to the man
of God to the hill, she caught him
by the feet: but Gehazi came near
to thrust her away. And the man of
God said, Let her alone; for her soul
is vexed within her: and the Lord
hath a hid it from me, and hath not
told me.

28 Then she said, Did I desire a
son of my lord? did I not say, Do
not deceive me?
29 Then he said to Gehazi, a Gird
up thy loins, and take my staff in
thine hand, and go thy way: if thou
meet any man, b salute him not; and
if any salute thee, answer him not
again: and lay my c staff upon the
face of the child.
30 And the mother of the child
said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy
soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And
he arose, and followed her.
31 And Gehazi passed on before
them, and laid the staff upon the
face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore
he went again to meet him, and
told him, saying, The child is not
a 
awaked.
32 And when Elisha was come
into the house, behold, the child
was dead, and laid upon his bed.
33 He went in therefore, and a shut
the door upon them twain, and
prayed unto the Lord.
34 And he went up, and lay upon
the child, and put his mouth upon
his mouth, and his eyes upon his
eyes, and his a hands upon his hands:
and he b stretched himself upon the
child; and the flesh of the child
waxed warm.
35 Then he returned, and walked
in the house to and fro; and went
up, and stretched himself upon him:
and the child sneezed seven times,
and the child a opened his eyes.
36 And he called Gehazi, and said,
Call this Shunammite. So he called
her. And when she was come in
unto him, he said, Take up thy son.
37 Then she went in, and fell at
his feet, and bowed herself to the
ground, and took up her a son, and
went out.

land; and the sons of the prophets
were sitting before him: and he said
unto his servant, Set on the great
pot, and seethe pottage for the sons
of the prophets.
39 And one went out into the
field to gather herbs, and found
a wild vine, and gathered thereof
wild gourds his lap full, and came
and shred them into the pot of
pottage: for they knew them not.
40 So they poured out for the men
to eat. And it came to pass, as they
were eating of the pottage, that they
cried out, and said, O thou man of
God, there is death in the pot. And
they could not eat thereof.
41 But he said, Then bring meal.
And he cast it into the a pot; and he
said, Pour out for the people, that
they may eat. And there was no
harm in the pot.
42 ¶ And there came a man from
Baal-shalisha, and a brought the
man of God bread of the firstfruits,
twenty loaves of barley, and full
ears of corn in the husk thereof.
And he said, Give unto the people,
that they may eat.
43 And his servitor said, What,
should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the
people, that they may eat: for thus
saith the Lord, They shall eat, and
shall leave thereof.
44 So he set it before them, and
they did eat, and a left thereof, according to the word of the Lord.

of the king of Syria, was a great
man with his master, and honourable, because by him the Lord had
given deliverance unto Syria: he
was also a mighty man in valour,
but he was a a leper.
2 And the Syrians had gone out by
companies, and had brought away
captive out of the land of Israel a
little maid; and she waited on Naaman’s wife.
3 And she said unto her mistress,
Would God my lord were with the
prophet that is in Samaria! for he
would recover him of his leprosy.
4 And one went in, and told his
lord, saying, Thus and thus said the
maid that is of the land of Israel.
5 And the king of Syria said, Go
to, go, and I will send a letter unto
the king of Israel. And he departed,
and a took with him ten talents of
silver, and six thousand pieces of
gold, and ten changes of raiment.
6 And he brought the letter to the
king of Israel, saying, Now when
this letter is come unto thee, behold,
I have therewith sent Naaman my
servant to thee, that thou mayest
recover him of his leprosy.
7 And it came to pass, when the
king of Israel had read the letter,
that he rent his clothes, and said,
Am I a God, to kill and to make alive,
that this man doth send unto me to
recover a man of his leprosy ? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how
he b seeketh a quarrel against me.
8 ¶ And it was so, when Elisha the
man of God had heard that the king
of Israel had rent his clothes, that he
sent to the king, saying, Wherefore
hast thou rent thy clothes? let him
come now to me, and he shall know
that there is a a prophet in Israel.
9 So Naaman came with his horses
and with his chariot, and stood at
the door of the house of Elisha.

10 And Elisha sent a messenger

11 But Naaman was wroth, and went
away, and said, Behold, I thought,
He will surely come out to me, and
stand, and call on the name of the
Lord his God, and strike his hand
over the place, and recover the leper.
12 Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the
waters of Israel? may I not wash in
them, and be clean? So he turned
and went away in a rage.
13 And his servants came near,
and spake unto him, and said, My
father, if the prophet had bid thee
do some a great thing, wouldest thou
not have done it? how much rather
then, when he saith to thee, Wash,
and be clean?
14 Then went he down, and dipped
himself seven times in Jordan, a according to the saying of the man of
God: and his b flesh came again like
unto the c flesh of a little child, and
he was d clean.
15 ¶ And he returned to the man
of God, he and all his company, and
came, and stood before him: and he
said, Behold, now I a know that there
is no b God in all the earth, but in
Israel: now therefore, I pray thee,
take a c blessing of thy servant.
16 But he said, As the Lord liveth,
before whom I stand, I will a receive
b 
none. And he urged him to take it;
but he refused.
17 And Naaman said, Shall there
not then, I pray thee, be given to thy
servant two mules’ burden of earth?
for thy servant will henceforth offer
neither burnt offering nor sacrifice
unto other gods, but unto the Lord.

goeth into the house of a Rimmon
to worship there, and he leaneth

the house of Rimmon: when I bow
down myself in the house of Rimmon, the Lord pardon thy servant
in this thing.
19 And he said unto him, Go in
peace. So he departed from him a
little way.
20 ¶ But Gehazi, the servant of Eli­
sha the man of God, said, Behold,
my master hath spared Naaman
this Syrian, in not receiving at his
hands that which he brought: but,
as the Lord liveth, I will run after
him, and take somewhat of him.
21 So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him
running after him, he lighted down
from the chariot to meet him, and
said, Is all well?
22 And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold,
even now there be come to me from
mount Ephraim two young men of
the sons of the prophets: give them,
I pray thee, a talent of silver, and
two changes of garments.
23 And Naaman said, Be content,
take two talents. And he urged him,
and bound two talents of silver in
two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of
his servants; and they bare them
before him.
24 And when he came to the tower,
he took them from their hand, and
bestowed them in the house: and he
let the men go, and they departed.
25 But he went in, and stood before
his master. And Elisha said unto
him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi?
And he said, Thy servant went no
whither.
26 And he said unto him, Went
not mine heart with thee, when the
man turned again from his chariot
to meet thee? Is it a time to receive
money, and to receive garments,
and oliveyards, and vineyards, and
sheep, and oxen, and menservants,
and maidservants?

from his presence a leper as white
as snow.
Chapter 6
Elisha causes an ax to float—He reveals to the king how to conduct a war
with Syria—Horses and chariots of
fire protect Elisha—The Syrians are
smitten with blindness—Benhadad besieges Samaria, and foodstuff sells for
a great price.
And the sons of the prophets said
unto Elisha, Behold now, the place
where we dwell with thee is too
a 
strait for us.
2 Let us go, we pray thee, unto
Jordan, and take thence every man
a beam, and let us make us a place
there, where we may dwell. And he
answered, Go ye.
3 And one said, Be content, I pray
thee, and go with thy servants. And
he answered, I will go.
4 So he went with them. And when
they came to Jordan, they cut down
wood.
5 But as one was felling a beam,
the axe head fell into the water: and
he cried, and said, Alas, master! for
it was a borrowed.
6 And the man of God said, Where
fell it? And he shewed him the place.
And he cut down a stick, and cast it
in thither; and the iron did swim.
7 Therefore said he, Take it up
to thee. And he put out his hand,
and took it.
8 ¶ Then the king of Syria warred
against Israel, and took counsel
with his servants, saying, In such
and such a place shall be my camp.
9 And the man of God sent unto
the king of Israel, saying, Beware
that thou pass not such a place; for
thither the Syrians are come down.
10 And the king of Israel sent to
the place which the man of God told
him and warned him of, and saved
himself there, not once nor twice.

11 Therefore the heart of the king
of Syria was sore troubled for this
thing; and he called his servants,
and said unto them, Will ye not
shew me which of us is for the king
of Israel?
12 And one of his servants said,
None, my lord, O king: but Elisha,
the prophet that is in Israel, telleth
the king of Israel the words that
thou speakest in thy bedchamber.
13 ¶ And he said, Go and spy where
he is, that I may send and fetch
him. And it was told him, saying,
Behold, he is in Dothan.
14 Therefore sent he thither horses,
and chariots, and a great host: and
they came by night, and compassed
the city about.
15 And when the servant of the
man of God was risen early, and
gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses
and chariots. And his servant said
unto him, Alas, my master! how
shall we do?
16 And he answered, Fear not:
for they that be with us are more
than they that be with them.
17 And Elisha prayed, and said,
Lord, I pray thee, open his a eyes,
that he may see. And the Lord
opened the eyes of the young man;
and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and b chariots
of fire round about Elisha.
18 And when they came down to
him, Elisha prayed unto the Lord,
and said, Smite this people, I pray
thee, with a blindness. And he smote
them with blindness according to
the word of Elisha.
19 ¶ And Elisha said unto them,
This is not the way, neither is this
the city: follow me, and I will bring
you to the man whom ye seek. But
he led them to Samaria.
20 And it came to pass, when they
were come into Samaria, that Eli­
sha said, Lord, open the eyes of
these men, that they may see. And
the Lord a opened their eyes, and
	17	a	 Num. 22:23.
		b	 2 Kgs. 7:6 (5–6).
	18	a	 Gen. 19:11.

they saw; and, behold, they were in
the midst of Samaria.
21 And the king of Israel said
unto Elisha, when he saw them,
My father, shall I smite them? shall
I smite them?
22 And he answered, Thou shalt
not smite them: wouldest thou a smite
those whom thou hast taken captive
with thy sword and with thy bow?
set bread and water before them,
that they may eat and drink, and
go to their master.
23 And he prepared great provision
for them: and when they had eaten
and drunk, he sent them away, and
they went to their master. So the
bands of Syria came no more into
the land of Israel.
24 ¶ And it came to pass after this,
that a Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and
besieged Samaria.
25 And there was a great famine in
Samaria: and, behold, they besieged
it, until an ass’s head was sold for
fourscore pieces of silver, and the
fourth part of a cab of dove’s dung
for five pieces of silver.
26 And as the king of Israel was
passing by upon the wall, there
cried a woman unto him, saying,
Help, my lord, O king.
27 And he said, If the Lord do
not help thee, whence shall I help
thee? out of the barnfloor, or out
of the winepress?
28 And the king said unto her,
What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me,
Give thy son, that we may eat him
to day, and we will eat my son to
morrow.
29 So we boiled my son, and did
a 
eat him: and I said unto her on
the next day, Give thy son, that
we may eat him: and she hath hid
her son.
30 ¶ And it came to pass, when the
king heard the words of the woman,
that he a rent his clothes; and he
passed by upon the wall, and the

people looked, and, behold, he had
sackcloth within upon his flesh.
31 Then he said, God do so and
more also to me, if the head of Eli­
sha the son of Shaphat shall stand
on him this day.
32 But Elisha sat in his house, and
the elders sat with him; and the king
sent a man from before him: but ere
the messenger came to him, he said
to the elders, See ye how this son of
a a murderer hath sent to take away
mine head? look, when the messen­
ger cometh, shut the door, and hold
him fast at the door: is not the sound
of his master’s feet behind him?
33 And while he yet talked with
them, behold, the messenger came
down unto him: and he said, Behold,
this evil is of the Lord; what should
I wait for the Lord any longer?
Chapter 7
Elisha prophesies incredible plenty in Samaria—The Syrian hosts flee at a noise
of battle and leave their possessions—Israel takes spoil from the Syrians.
Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word
of the Lord; Thus saith the Lord,
To morrow about this time shall a
measure of fine flour be sold for a
shekel, and two measures of barley
for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.
2 Then a a lord on whose hand the
king leaned answered the man of
God, and said, Behold, if the Lord
would make b windows in heaven,
might this thing be? And he said,
Behold, thou shalt see it with thine
eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.
3 ¶ And there were four leprous
men at the entering in of the gate:
and they said one to another, Why
sit we here until we die?
4 If we say, We will enter into the
city, then the famine is in the city,
and we shall die there: and if we sit
still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the
host of the Syrians: if they save us
alive, we shall live; and if they kill
us, we shall but die.

5 And they rose up in the twilight,
to go unto the camp of the Syrians:
and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria,
behold, there was no man there.
6 For the Lord had made the host
of the Syrians to hear a noise of
a 
chariots, and a noise of horses, even
the noise of a great host: and they
said one to another, Lo, the king
of Israel hath hired against us the
kings of the Hittites, and the kings
of the Egyptians, to come upon us.
7 Wherefore they arose and fled
in the twilight, and left their tents,
and their horses, and their asses,
even the camp as it was, and fled
for their life.
8 And when these lepers came to
the uttermost part of the camp, they
went into one tent, and did eat and
drink, and carried thence silver, and
gold, and raiment, and went and hid
it; and came again, and entered into
another tent, and carried thence also,
and went and hid it.
9 Then they said one to another,
We do not well: this day is a day of
good tidings, and we hold our peace:
if we tarry till the morning light,
some mischief will come upon us:
now therefore come, that we may
go and tell the king’s household.
10 So they came and called unto
the porter of the city: and they told
them, saying, We came to the camp
of the Syrians, and, behold, there
was no man there, neither voice of
man, but horses tied, and asses tied,
and the tents as they were.
11 And he called the porters;
and they told it to the king’s house
within.
12 ¶ And the king arose in the
night, and said unto his servants, I
will now shew you what the Syrians
have done to us. They know that we
be hungry; therefore are they gone
out of the camp to hide themselves
in the field, saying, When they come
out of the city, we shall catch them
alive, and get into the city.
13 And one of his ser vant s

2 Kings 7:14–8:8

518

answered and said, Let some take,
I pray thee, five of the horses that
remain, which are left in the city,
(behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the
multitude of the Israelites that are
consumed:) and let us send and see.
14 They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after
the host of the Syrians, saying, Go
and see.
15 And they went after them unto
Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full
of garments and vessels, which the
Syrians had cast away in their haste.
And the messengers returned, and
told the king.
16 And the people went out, and
spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a
measure of fine flour was sold for a
shekel, and two measures of barley
for a shekel, according to the word
of the Lord.
17 ¶ And the king appointed the
lord on whose hand he leaned to
have the charge of the gate: and
the people trode upon him in the
gate, and he died, as the man of
God had said, who spake when the
king came down to him.
18 And it came to pass as the man
of God had spoken to the king,
saying, Two measures of barley
for a shekel, and a measure of fine
flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of
Samaria:
19 And that lord answered the
man of God, and said, Now, behold,
if the Lord should make windows
in heaven, might such a thing be?
And he said, Behold, thou shalt see
it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat
thereof.
20 And so it fell out unto him: for
the people trode upon him in the
gate, and he died.
Chapter 8
Elisha prophesies a seven-year famine—
The Shunammite woman is preserved
8	1	a	 2 Kgs. 4:35 (32–35);

through the famine —Jehoram and
then Ahaziah reign in wickedness in
Judah.
Then spake Elisha unto the woman,
whose son he had a restored to life,
saying, Arise, and go thou and thine
household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the
Lord hath called for a b famine; and
it shall also come upon the land
seven years.
2 And the woman arose, and did
after the saying of the man of God:
and she went with her household,
and sojourned in the land of the
Philistines seven years.
3 And it came to pass at the
seven years’ end, that the woman
returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry
unto the king for her house and
for her land.
4 And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God,
saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all
the great things that Elisha hath
done.
5 And it came to pass, as he was
telling the king how he had restored
a dead body to life, that, behold,
the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for
her house and for her land. And
Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this
is the woman, and this is her son,
whom Elisha restored to life.
6 And when the king asked the
woman, she told him. So the king
appointed unto her a certain off­
icer, saying, Restore all that was
hers, and all the fruits of the field
since the day that she left the land,
even until now.
7 ¶ And Elisha came to Damascus;
and Ben-hadad the king of Syria
was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.
8 And the king said unto Hazael,
Take a present in thine hand, and
go, meet the man of God, and inquire of the Lord by him, saying,
Shall I recover of this disease?

2 Kings 8:9–29

9 So Hazael went to meet him,
and took a present with him, even
of every good thing of Damascus,
forty camels’ burden, and came and
stood before him, and said, Thy son
Ben-hadad king of Syria hath sent
me to thee, saying, Shall I recover
of this disease?
10 And Elisha said unto him, Go,
say unto him, Thou mayest certainly
recover: howbeit the Lord hath
shewed me that he shall surely die.
11 And he settled his countenance
steadfastly, until he was ashamed:
and the man of God wept.
12 And a Hazael said, Why weepeth
my lord? And he answered, Because
I know the evil that thou wilt do
unto the children of Israel: their
strong holds wilt thou set on fire,
and their young men wilt thou slay
with the sword, and wilt dash their
children, and rip up their women
with child.
13 And Hazael said, But what, is
thy servant a dog, that he should
do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The Lord hath shewed me
that thou shalt be a king over Syria.
14 So he departed from Elisha,
and came to his master; who said
to him, What said Elisha to thee?
And he answered, He told me that
thou shouldest surely recover.
15 And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and
dipped it in water, and spread it on
his face, so that he died: and Hazael
reigned in his stead.
16 ¶ And in the fifth year of Joram
the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah,
Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat
king of Judah began to reign.
17 Thirty and two years old was
he when he began to reign; and he
reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
18 And he walked in the way of
the kings of Israel, as did the house
of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab
was his wife: and he did evil in the
sight of the Lord.
	12	a	 2 Kgs. 10:32; 13:3;

19 Yet the Lord would not a destroy
Judah for b David his servant’s sake,
as he promised him to give him
alway a light, and to his children.
20 ¶ In his days Edom a revolted
from under the b hand of Judah,
and made a king over themselves.
21 So Joram went over to Zair, and
all the chariots with him: and he
rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about,
and the captains of the chariots:
and the people fled into their tents.
22 Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this
day. Then Libnah revolted at the
same time.
23 And the rest of the acts of
Joram, and all that he did, are they
not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Judah?
24 And Joram slept with his fathers,
and was buried with his fathers in
the city of David: and Ahaziah his
son reigned in his stead.
25 ¶ In the twelfth year of Joram
the son of Ahab king of Israel did
Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king
of Judah begin to reign.
26 Two and twenty years old was
a 
Ahaziah when he began to reign;
and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was
Athaliah, the daughter of Omri
king of Israel.
27 And he walked in the way of
the house of Ahab, and did evil in
the sight of the Lord, as did the
house of Ahab: for he was the son
in law of the house of Ahab.
28 ¶ And he went with a Joram the
son of Ahab to the war against Ha­
zael king of Syria in Ramoth-gilead;
and the Syrians wounded Joram.
29 And king Joram went back to
be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
which the Syrians had given him
at Ramah, when he fought against
Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah
the son of Jehoram king of Judah
went down to see Joram the son of
Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.

Chapter 9
A prophet anoints Jehu king over Israel
and prophesies the destruction of the
house of Ahab and the death of Jeze­
bel—Jehu kills Joram in the field of
Naboth—Jezebel is killed by Jehu and
is eaten by dogs.
And Elisha the prophet called one
of the children of the prophets, and
said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and
take this box of oil in thine hand,
and go to Ramoth-gilead:
2 And when thou comest thither,
look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and
go in, and make him arise up from
among his brethren, and carry him
to an inner chamber;
3 Then take the box of oil, and
pour it on his head, and say, Thus
saith the Lord, I have anointed
thee king over Israel. Then open
the door, and flee, and tarry not.
4 ¶ So the young man, even the
young man the prophet, went to
Ramoth-gilead.
5 And when he came, behold, the
captains of the host were sitting; and
he said, I have an errand to thee, O
captain. And Jehu said, Unto which
of all us? And he said, To thee, O
captain.
6 And he arose, and went into the
house; and he poured the a oil on
his head, and said unto him, Thus
saith the Lord God of Israel, I have
anointed thee king over the people
of the Lord, even over Israel.
7 And thou shalt a smite the house
of Ahab thy master, that I may
avenge the blood of my servants the
prophets, and the blood of all the
servants of the Lord, at the hand
of b Jezebel.
8 For the whole house of a Ahab
shall perish: and I will cut off from
Ahab him that pisseth against the
wall, and him that is shut up and
left in Israel:
9 And I will make the house of
Ahab like the house of a Jeroboam
9	6	a	 2 Chr. 22:7 (7–9).
	7	a	 2 Kgs. 9:24 (21–25),

the son of Nebat, and like the house
of b Baasha the son of Ahijah:
10 And the a dogs shall eat Jezebel
in the portion of Jezreel, and there
shall be none to bury her. And he
opened the door, and fled.
11 ¶ Then Jehu came forth to the
servants of his lord: and one said
unto him, Is all well? wherefore
came this mad fellow to thee? And
he said unto them, Ye know the
man, and his communication.
12 And they said, It is false; tell us
now. And he said, Thus and thus
spake he to me, saying, Thus saith
the Lord, I have anointed thee king
over Israel.
13 Then they hasted, and took
every man his garment, and put it
under him on the top of the stairs,
and blew with trumpets, saying,
Jehu is king.
14 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat
the son of Nimshi conspired against
Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.
15 But king Joram was returned to
be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
which the Syrians had given him,
when he fought with Hazael king of
Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your
minds, then let none go forth nor
escape out of the city to go to tell
it in Jezreel.
16 So Jehu rode in a chariot, and
went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there.
And Ahaziah king of Judah was
come down to see Joram.
17 And there stood a watchman on
the tower in Jezreel, and he spied
the company of Jehu as he came,
and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and
send to meet them, and let him say,
Is it peace?
18 So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus
saith the king, Is it peace? And
Jehu said, What hast thou to do
with peace? turn thee behind me.
And the watchman told, saying,

The messenger came to them, but
he cometh not again.
19 Then he sent out a second on
horseback, which came to them, and
said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace?
And Jehu answered, What hast thou to
do with peace? turn thee behind me.
20 And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and
cometh not again: and the driving
is like the driving of Jehu the son
of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.
21 And Joram said, Make ready.
And his chariot was made ready.
And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each
in his chariot, and they went out
against Jehu, and met him in the
portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.
22 And it came to pass, when Joram
saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace,
Jehu? And he answered, What peace,
so long as the whoredoms of thy
mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts
are so many ?
23 And Joram turned his hands,
and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There
is treachery, O Ahaziah.
24 And Jehu drew a bow with his
full strength, and a smote Jehoram
between his arms, and the arrow
went out at his heart, and he sunk
down in his chariot.
25 Then said Jehu to Bidkar his
captain, Take up, and cast him in
the portion of the field of Naboth
the Jezreelite: for remember how
that, when I and thou rode together
after Ahab his father, the Lord laid
this burden upon him;
26 Surely I have seen yesterday the
blood of Naboth, and the blood of
his sons, saith the Lord; and I will
requite thee in this plat, saith the
Lord. Now therefore take and cast
him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the Lord.
27 ¶ But when Ahaziah the king of
Judah saw this, he fled by the way
of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, a Smite
him also in the chariot. And they did

so at the going up to Gur, which is
by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo,
and died there.
28 And his servants carried him
in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his
fathers in the city of David.
29 And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah
to reign over Judah.
30 ¶ And when Jehu was come
to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and
she painted her face, and a tired her
head, and looked out at a window.
31 And as Jehu entered in at the
gate, she said, Had a Zimri peace,
who slew his master?
32 And he lifted up his face to the
window, and said, Who is on my
side? who? And there looked out
to him two or three eunuchs.
33 And he said, Throw her down.
So they a threw her down: and some
of her blood was sprinkled on the
wall, and on the horses: and he
trode her under foot.
34 And when he was come in, he
did eat and drink, and said, Go, see
now this cursed woman, and bury
her: for she is a king’s a daughter.
35 And they went to bury her: but
they found no more of her than the
skull, and the feet, and the palms
of her hands.
36 Wherefore they came again, and
told him. And he said, This is the
word of the Lord, which he spake
by his servant Elijah the Tishbite,
saying, In the portion of Jezreel
shall a dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:
37 And the carcase of Jezebel shall
be as dung upon the face of the field
in the portion of Jezreel; so that
they shall not say, This is Jezebel.

And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and
sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of
Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that
brought up Ahab’s children, saying,
2 Now as soon as this letter cometh
to you, seeing your master’s sons
are with you, and there are with you
chariots and horses, a fenced city
also, and armour;
3 Look even out the best and
meetest of your master’s sons, and
set him on his father’s throne, and
fight for your master’s house.
4 But they were exceedingly afraid,
and said, Behold, two kings stood
not before him: how then shall we
stand?
5 And he that was over the house,
and he that was over the city, the
elders also, and the bringers up of
the children, sent to Jehu, saying,
We are thy servants, and will do all
that thou shalt bid us; we will not
make any king: do thou that which
is good in thine eyes.
6 Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be
mine, and if ye will hearken unto my
voice, take ye the heads of the men
your master’s sons, and come to me
to Jezreel by to morrow this time.
Now the king’s sons, being seventy
persons, were with the great men of
the city, which brought them up.
7 And it came to pass, when the
letter came to them, that they took
the king’s sons, and slew seventy
persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.
8 ¶ And there came a messenger,
and told him, saying, They have
brought the a heads of the king’s
sons. And he said, Lay ye them in
two heaps at the entering in of the
gate until the morning.
9 And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and
said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I a conspired against
my master, and slew him: but who
slew all these?

	10	a	 1 Sam. 3:19;

10 Know now that there shall a fall
unto the earth nothing of the word
of the Lord, which the Lord spake
concerning the house of Ahab: for
the Lord hath done that which he
spake by his servant Elijah.
11 So a Jehu slew all that remained
of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and
all his great men, and his kinsfolks,
and his priests, until he left him
none remaining.
12 ¶ And he arose and departed,
and came to Samaria. And as he
was at the shearing house in the
way,
13 Jehu met with the brethren of
Ahaziah king of Judah, and said,
Who are ye? And they answered,
We are the brethren of Ahaziah;
and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children
of the queen.
14 And he said, Take them alive.
And they took them alive, and
slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men;
neither left he any of them.
15 ¶ And when he was departed
thence, he lighted on a Jehonadab
the son of b Rechab coming to meet
him: and he saluted him, and said
to him, Is thine heart right, as my
heart is with thy heart? And Jehona­
dab answered, It is. If it be, give me
thine hand. And he gave him his
hand; and he took him up to him
into the chariot.
16 And he said, Come with me,
and see my zeal for the Lord. So
they made him ride in his chariot.
17 And when he came to Samaria,
he slew all that remained unto
a 
Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the Lord, which he spake
to Elijah.
18 ¶ And Jehu gathered all the
people together, and said unto them,
a 
Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu
shall serve him much.

servants, and all his priests; let none
be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall
be wanting, he shall not live. But
Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent
that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.
20 And Jehu said, Proclaim a a solemn assembly for Baal. And they
proclaimed it.
21 And Jehu sent through all Israel:
and all the worshippers of Baal
came, so that there was not a man
left that came not. And they came
into the house of Baal; and the
house of Baal was full from one end
to another.
22 And he said unto him that was
over the vestry, Bring forth a vestments for all the worshippers of
Baal. And he brought them forth
vestments.
23 And Jehu went, and Jehonadab
the son of Rechab, into the house
of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that
there be here with you none of the
servants of the Lord, but the worshippers of Baal only.
24 And when they went in to offer
sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu
appointed fourscore men without,
and said, If any of the men whom
I have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his a life
shall be for the life of him.
25 And it came to pass, as soon as
he had made an end of offering the
burnt offering, that Jehu said to the
guard and to the captains, Go in,
and slay them; let none come forth.
And they smote them with the edge
of the sword; and the guard and the
captains cast them out, and went to
the city of the house of Baal.
26 And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and
burned them.

of Baal, and made it a draught house
unto this day.
28 Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out
of Israel.
29 ¶ Howbeit from the sins of a Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made
Israel to b sin, Jehu departed not
from after them, to wit, the golden
c 
calves that were in Beth-el, and that
were in Dan.
30 And the Lord said unto Jehu,
Because thou hast done well in exe­
cuting that which is right in mine
eyes, and hast done unto the house
of Ahab according to all that was
in mine heart, thy children of the
fourth generation shall sit on the
a 
throne of Israel.
31 But Jehu took no heed to a walk
in the law of the Lord God of Israel
with all his heart: for he departed
not from the sins of Jeroboam, which
made Israel to sin.
32 ¶ In those days the Lord began
to cut Israel short: and a Hazael smote
them in all the coasts of Israel;
33 From Jordan eastward, all the
land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the
Reubenites, and the Manassites,
from a Aroer, which is by the river
Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.
34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehu,
and all that he did, and all his might,
are they not written in the book of
the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
35 And Jehu slept with his fathers:
and they buried him in Samaria.
And Jehoahaz his son reigned in
his stead.
36 And the time that Jehu reigned
over Israel in Samaria was twenty
and eight years.

And when a Athaliah the mother
of Ahaziah saw that her son was
dead, she arose and destroyed all
the seed royal.
2 But Jehosheba, the daughter of
king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took
Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole
him from among the king’s sons
which were slain; and they hid him,
even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he
was not slain.
3 And he was with her hid in the
house of the Lord six years. And
Athaliah did reign over the land.
4 ¶ And the seventh year Jehoiada
sent and fetched the rulers over
hundreds, with the captains and
the guard, and brought them to
him into the house of the Lord, and
made a a covenant with them, and
took an oath of them in the house
of the Lord, and shewed them the
king’s son.
5 And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall
do; A third part of you that enter in
on the a sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king’s house;
6 And a third part shall be at the
a 
gate of Sur; and a third part at the
gate behind the guard: so shall ye
keep the watch of the house, that
it be not broken down.
7 And two parts of all you that
go forth on the sabbath, even they
shall keep the watch of the house
of the Lord about the king.
8 And ye shall compass the king
round about, every man with his
weapons in his hand: and he that
cometh within the ranges, let him
be slain: and be ye with the king as
he goeth out and as he cometh in.
9 And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that
Jehoiada the priest commanded:
and they took every man his men
that were to come in on the sabbath,
with them that should go out on
the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada
the priest.

11 And the guard stood, every
man with his weapons in his hand,
round about the king, from the
right corner of the temple to the
left corner of the temple, along by
the altar and the temple.
12 And he brought forth the king’s
son, and put the crown upon him,
and gave him the a testimony; and
they made him king, and anointed
him; and they clapped their hands,
and said, b God save the king.
13 ¶ And when Athaliah heard
the noise of the guard and of the
people, she came to the people into
the temple of the Lord.
14 And when she looked, behold,
the king stood by a a pillar, as the
manner was, and the princes and the
trumpeters by the king, and all the
people of the land rejoiced, and blew
with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her
clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.
15 But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and
said unto them, Have her forth
without the ranges: and him that
followeth her kill with the sword.
For the priest had said, Let her not
be slain in the house of the Lord.
16 And they laid hands on her; and
she went by the way by the which
the a horses came into the king’s
house: and there was she slain.
17 ¶ And Jehoiada made a covenant between the Lord and the
king and the people, that they
should be the Lord’s people; between the king also and the people.
18 And all the people of the land
went into the house of Baal, and
brake it down; his altars and his
images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest
of Baal before the altars. And the
priest appointed officers over the
house of the Lord.

19 And he took the rulers over
hundreds, and the captains, and
the guard, and all the people of the
land; and they brought down the
king from the house of the Lord,
and came by the way of the gate of
the guard to the king’s house. And
he sat on the throne of the kings.
20 And all the people of the land
rejoiced, and the city was in quiet:
and they slew Athaliah with the
sword beside the king’s house.
21 Seven years old was Jehoash
when he began to reign.
Chapter 12
Jehoash ( Joash) reigns in righteousness—The breaches in the temple are
repaired—The safety of Jerusalem is
purchased with the hallowed things in
the temple—Joash is slain and Ama­
ziah reigns.
In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash
began to reign; and forty years
reigned he in Jerusalem. And his
mother’s name was Zibiah of Beersheba.
2 And Jehoash did that which was
right in the sight of the Lord all his
days wherein Jehoiada the priest
instructed him.
3 But the a high places were not
taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the
high places.
4 ¶ And Jehoash said to the priests,
All the a money of the dedicated
things that is brought into the house
of the Lord, even the money of every one that passeth the account, the
money that every man is set at, and
all the money that cometh into any
man’s heart to bring into the house
of the Lord,
5 Let the priests take it to them,
every man of his acquaintance:
and let them repair the breaches of
the house, wheresoever any breach
shall be found.
6 But it was so, that in the three
and twentieth year of king Jehoash
12	3	a	 Deut. 12:2 (2–3).
	4	a	 Ex. 30:12;
2 Kgs. 22:4 (4–7).

the priests had not repaired the
a 
breaches of the house.
7 Then king Jehoash called for
Jehoiada the priest, and the other
priests, and said unto them, Why
repair ye not the breaches of the
house? now therefore receive no
more money of your acquaintance,
but deliver it for the breaches of
the house.
8 And the priests consented to
receive no more money of the people, neither to repair the breaches
of the house.
9 But Jehoiada the priest took a
chest, and bored a hole in the lid of
it, and set it beside the altar, on the
right side as one cometh into the
house of the Lord: and the priests
that kept the door put therein all
the money that was brought into
the house of the Lord.
10 And it was so, when they saw
that there was much money in the
chest, that the king’s scribe and the
high priest came up, and they put
up in bags, and told the a money that
was found in the house of the Lord.
11 And they gave the money, being
told, into the hands of them that did
the work, that had the oversight of
the house of the Lord: and they laid
it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house
of the Lord,
12 And to masons, and hewers
of stone, and to buy timber and
hewed stone to repair the breaches
of the house of the Lord, and for all
that was laid out for the house to
repair it.
13 Howbeit there were not made
for the house of the Lord a bowls
of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets,
any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought
into the house of the Lord:
14 But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the
house of the Lord.
15 Moreover they a reckoned not
with the men, into whose hand they

delivered the money to be bestowed
on workmen: for they dealt faithfully.
16 The a trespass money and b sin
money was not brought into the
house of the Lord: it was the priests’.
17 ¶ Then Hazael king of Syria
went up, and fought against Gath,
and took it: and Hazael set his face
to go up to Jerusalem.
18 And Jehoash king of Judah
took all the hallowed things that
Je­h oshaphat, and Jehoram, and
Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah,
had dedicated, and his own a hallowed things, and all the gold that
was found in the treasures of the
house of the Lord, and in the king’s
house, and sent it to Hazael king
of Syria: and he went away from
Jerusalem.
19 ¶ And the rest of the acts of
Joash, and all that he did, are they
not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Judah?
20 And his servants arose, and
made a conspiracy, and a slew Joash
in the house of b Millo, which goeth
down to Silla.
21 For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and
he died; and they buried him with
his fathers in the city of David:
and Amaziah his son reigned in
his stead.
Chapter 13

began to reign over Israel in Samaria,
and reigned seventeen years.
2 And he did that which was evil
in the sight of the Lord, and followed the sins of a Jeroboam the son
of Nebat, which made Israel to sin;
he departed not therefrom.
3 ¶ And the a anger of the Lord
was kindled against Israel, and
he delivered them into the hand
of b Hazael king of Syria, and into
the hand of Ben-hadad the son of
Hazael, all their days.
4 And Jehoahaz a  besought the
Lord, and the Lord hearkened unto
him: for he saw the b oppression of
Israel, because the king of Syria
oppressed them.
5 (And the Lord gave Israel a a saviour, so that they went out from
under the hand of the Syrians: and
the children of Israel dwelt in their
tents, as beforetime.
6 Nevertheless they departed
not from the a sins of the house of
Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but
walked therein: and there remained
the grove also in Samaria.)
7 Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen,
and ten chariots, and ten thousand
footmen; for the king of Syria had
destroyed them, and had made them
like the dust by a threshing.
8 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of
Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and
his might, are they not written in
the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Israel?
9 And Jehoahaz slept with his
fathers; and they buried him in
Samaria: and Joash his son reigned
in his stead.
10 ¶ In the thirty and seventh year
of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign
over Israel in Samaria, and reigned
sixteen years.

11 And he did that which was evil in
the sight of the Lord; he departed
not from all the sins of Jeroboam
the son of Nebat, who made Israel
sin: but he walked therein.
12 And the rest of the acts of Joash,
and all that he did, and his might
wherewith he fought against Ama­
ziah king of Judah, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
13 And Joash slept with his fathers;
and Jeroboam sat upon his throne:
and Joash was buried in Samaria
with the kings of Israel.
14 ¶ Now Elisha was fallen sick of
his sickness whereof he died. And
Joash the king of Israel came down
unto him, and wept over his face,
and said, O my father, my father,
the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.
15 And Elisha said unto him, Take
bow and arrows. And he took unto
him bow and arrows.
16 And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow.
And he put his hand upon it: and
Elisha put his hands upon the king’s
hands.
17 And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it.
Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he
shot. And he said, The arrow of the
Lord’s deliverance, and the arrow
of deliverance from Syria: for thou
shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek,
till thou have consumed them.
18 And he said, Take the arrows.
And he took them. And he said unto
the king of Israel, Smite upon the
ground. And he smote thrice, and
a 
stayed.
19 And the man of God was wroth
with him, and said, Thou shouldest
have smitten five or six times; then
hadst thou smitten Syria till thou
hadst consumed it: whereas now
thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.
20 ¶ And Elisha died, and they
buried him. And the bands of the
Moabites invaded the land at the
coming in of the year.
21 And it came to pass, as they

were burying a man, that, behold,
they spied a band of men; and they
cast the man into the sepulchre of
Elisha: and when the man was let
down, and touched the bones of
Elisha, he revived, and stood up
on his feet.
22 ¶ But Hazael king of Syria
oppressed Israel all the days of
Jehoahaz.
23 And the Lord was gracious
unto them, and had a compassion on
them, and had respect unto them,
because of his b covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would
not destroy them, neither cast he
them from his presence as yet.
24 So Hazael king of Syria died;
and Ben-hadad his son reigned in
his stead.
25 And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of
Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the
cities, which he had taken out of
the hand of Jehoahaz his father by
war. Three times did Joash beat
him, and recovered the cities of
Israel.
Chapter 14
Amaziah reigns well in Judah—Israel
defeats Judah in battle—Jeroboam
reigns in wickedness in Israel.
In the second year of Joash son of
Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned
Amaziah the son of Joash king of
Judah.
2 He was twenty and five years
old when he began to reign, and
reigned twenty and nine years in
Jerusalem. And his mother’s name
was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
3 And he did that which was right
in the sight of the Lord, yet not like
David his father: he did according
to all things as Joash his father did.
4 Howbeit the high places were
not taken away: as yet the people
did sacrifice and burnt incense on
the high places.
5 ¶ And it came to pass, as soon
as the kingdom was confirmed in
his hand, that he slew his servants

which had a  slain the king his
father.
6 But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that
which is written in the book of the
law of Moses, wherein the Lord
commanded, saying, The fathers
shall not be put to death for the
children, nor the children be put
to death for the fathers; but every
man shall be put to a death for his
b 
own c sin.
7 He slew of Edom in the valley of
a 
salt ten thousand, and took Selah
by war, and called the name of it
Joktheel unto this day.
8 ¶ Then Amaziah sent messengers
to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son
of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come,
let us look one another in the face.
9 And Jehoash the king of Israel
sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon
sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to
my son to wife: and there passed by
a wild beast that was in Lebanon,
and trode down the thistle.
10 Thou hast indeed smitten Edom,
and thine heart hath a lifted thee up:
glory of this, and tarry at home: for
why shouldest thou meddle to thy
hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even
thou, and Judah with thee?
11 But Amaziah would not hear.
Therefore Jehoash king of Israel
went up; and he and Amaziah king
of Judah looked one another in
the face at Beth-shemesh, which
belongeth to Judah.
12 And Judah was put to the worse
before Israel; and they fled every
man to their tents.
13 And Jehoash king of Israel took
Amaziah king of Judah, the son of
Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem,
and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim
unto the corner gate, four hundred
cubits.

14 And he took all the gold and

found in the house of the Lord,
and in the treasures of the king’s
house, and hostages, and returned
to Samaria.
15 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might,
and how he fought with Amaziah
king of Judah, are they not written
in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Israel?
16 And Jehoash slept with his
fathers, and was buried in Samaria
with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.
17 ¶ And Amaziah the son of Joash
king of Judah lived after the death
of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of
Israel fifteen years.
18 And the rest of the acts of
Amaziah, are they not written in
the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Judah?
19 Now they made a conspiracy
against him in Jerusalem: and he
fled to Lachish; but they sent after
him to Lachish, and slew him there.
20 And they brought him on horses:
and he was buried at Jerusalem
with his fathers in the city of David.
21 ¶ And all the people of Judah
took Azariah, which was sixteen
years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.
22 He built a Elath, and restored it
to Judah, after that the king slept
with his fathers.
23 ¶ In the fifteenth year of Ama­
ziah the son of Joash king of Judah
Jeroboam the son of Joash king of
Israel began to reign in Samaria,
and reigned forty and one years.
24 And he did that which was evil in
the sight of the Lord: he departed
not from all the sins of a Jeroboam
the son of Nebat, who made Israel
to sin.
25 He restored the coast of Israel
from the entering of Hamath unto
the sea of the plain, according to the

word of the Lord God of Israel,
which he spake by the hand of his
servant a Jonah, the son of Amittai,
the prophet, which was of Gathhepher.
26 For the Lord saw the affliction
of Israel, that it was very bitter: for
there was not any shut up, nor any
left, nor any helper for Israel.
27 And the Lord said not that he
would blot out the name of Israel
from under heaven: but he saved
them by the hand of Jeroboam the
son of Joash.
28 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his
might, how he warred, and how he
recovered Damascus, and Hamath,
which belonged to Judah, for Israel,
are they not written in the book of
the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
29 And Jeroboam slept with his
fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned
in his stead.
Chapter 15
Many kings reign in Israel and in Judah—Their wickedness, wars, conspira­
cies, and evils are described—Much of
Israel is carried captive to Assyria by
Tiglath-pileser.
In the twenty and seventh year of
Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah
to reign.
2 Sixteen years old was he when
he began to reign, and he reigned
two and fifty years in Jerusalem.
And his mother’s name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.
3 And he did that which was right
in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father Amaziah
had done;
4 Save that the high places were
not removed: the people sacrificed
and burnt incense still on the high
places.
5 ¶ And the Lord smote the king,

so that he was a a leper unto the day
of his death, and dwelt in a b several house. And c Jotham the king’s
son was over the house, judging the
people of the land.
6 And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
7 So Azariah slept with his fathers;
and they buried him with his fathers
in the city of David: and Jotham his
son reigned in his stead.
8 ¶ In the thirty and eighth year
of Azariah king of Judah did Zacha­
riah the son of Jeroboam reign over
Israel in Samaria six months.
9 And he did that which was evil in
the sight of the Lord, as his fathers
had done: he departed not from the
sins of a Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
who made Israel to sin.
10 And Shallum the son of Jabesh
conspired against him, and a smote
him before the people, and slew
him, and reigned in his stead.
11 And the rest of the acts of
Zacha­riah, behold, they are written
in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Israel.
12 This was the word of the Lord
which he spake unto a Jehu, saying,
Thy sons shall sit on the b throne of
Israel unto the fourth generation.
And so it came to pass.
13 ¶ Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth
year of a Uzziah king of Judah; and
he reigned a full month in Samaria.
14 For Menahem the son of Gadi
went up from Tirzah, and came to
Samaria, and smote Shallum the son
of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him,
and reigned in his stead.
15 And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he
made, behold, they are written in
the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Israel.
16 ¶ Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and

the coasts thereof from Tirzah:
because they opened not to him,
therefore he smote it; and all the
women therein that were with child
he ripped up.
17 In the nine and thirtieth year
of Azariah king of Judah began
Menahem the son of Gadi to reign
over Israel, and reigned ten years in
Samaria.
18 And he did that which was evil in
the sight of the Lord: he departed
not all his days from the sins of
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who
made Israel to sin.
19 And Pul the king of a Assyria
came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents
of silver, that his hand might be
with him to confirm the kingdom
in his hand.
20 And Menahem exacted the
money of Israel, even of all the
mighty men of wealth, of each man
fifty shekels of silver, to give to the
king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not
there in the land.
21 ¶ And the rest of the acts of
Menahem, and all that he did, are
they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel?
22 And Menahem slept with his
fathers; and Pekahiah his son
reigned in his stead.
23 ¶ In the fiftieth year of Azariah
king of Judah Pekahiah the son of
Menahem began to reign over Israel
in Samaria, and reigned two years.
24 And he did that which was evil in
the sight of the Lord: he departed
not from the sins of Jeroboam the
son of Nebat, who made Israel
to sin.
25 But a Pekah the son of Remaliah,
a captain of his, conspired against
him, and smote him in Samaria, in
the palace of the king’s house, with
Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty

him, and reigned in his room.
26 And the rest of the acts of Peka­
hiah, and all that he did, behold,
they are written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel.
27 ¶ In the two and fiftieth year
of Azariah king of Judah a Pekah
the son of Remaliah began to reign
over Israel in Samaria, and reigned
twenty years.
28 And he did that which was evil in
the sight of the Lord: he departed
not from the sins of Jeroboam the
son of Nebat, who made Israel
to sin.
29 In the days of Pekah king of
Israel came a Tiglath-pileser king of
Assyria, and b took Ijon, and Abelbeth-maachah, and Janoah, and
Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and
Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and
c 
carried them captive to d Assyria.
30 And Hoshea the son of Elah
made a conspiracy against Pekah
the son of Remaliah, and smote
him, and slew him, and reigned in
his stead, in the twentieth year of
a 
Jotham the son of Uzziah.
31 And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold,
they are written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel.
32 ¶ In the second year of Pekah
the son of Remaliah king of Israel
began a Jotham the son of Uzziah
king of Judah to reign.
33 Five and twenty years old was
he when he began to reign, and he
reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
And his mother’s name was Jerusha,
the daughter of Zadok.
34 And he did that which was right
in the sight of the Lord: he did according to all that his father Uzziah
had done.
35 ¶ Howbeit the high places were
not removed: the people sacrificed

the house of the Lord.
36 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of
Jotham, and all that he did, are
they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Judah?
37 In those days the Lord began
to send against Judah a Rezin the
king of Syria, and Pekah the son
of Remaliah.
38 And a  Jotham slept with his
fathers, and was buried with his
fathers in the city of David his father:
and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
Chapter 16
Ahaz reigns in wickedness in Judah—He
offers his son in heathen sacrifice—He
makes a new altar, destroys the brazen
sea, and changes the method for sacrificing in the temple.
In the seventeenth year of Pekah
the son of Remaliah a Ahaz the son
of Jotham king of Judah began to
reign.
2 Twenty years old was Ahaz when
he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not
that which was right in the sight of the
Lord his God, like David his father.
3 But he walked in the way of the
kings of Israel, yea, and made his
son to pass through the a fire, according to the abominations of the
b

from before the children of Israel.
4 And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the a high places, and on the
hills, and under every green tree.
5 ¶ Then a Rezin king of Syria and
Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war:
and they besieged Ahaz, but could
not overcome him.
6 At that time Rezin king of Syria
recovered Elath to Syria, and drave
the Jews from Elath: and the Syri	35	a	 2 Chr. 27:3;

ans came to Elath, and dwelt there
unto this day.
7 So Ahaz sent messengers to
a 
Tiglath-pileser king of b Assyria,
saying, I am thy servant and thy
son: come up, and c save me out of
the hand of the king of Syria, and
out of the hand of the king of Israel,
which rise up against me.
8 And Ahaz a took the silver and
gold that was found in the house
of the Lord, and in the treasures of
the king’s house, and sent it for a
present to the king of Assyria.
9 And the king of Assyria heark­
ened unto him: for the king of
Assyria went up against Damascus,
and took it, and carried the people
of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.
10 ¶ And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king
of Assyria, and saw an altar that was
at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to
Urijah the priest the fashion of the
altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.
11 And Urijah the priest built an
altar according to all that king Ahaz
had sent from Damascus: so Urijah
the priest made it against king Ahaz
came from Damascus.
12 And when the king was come
from Damascus, the king saw the
altar: and the king approached to
the altar, and offered thereon.
13 And he burnt his burnt offering
and his meat offering, and poured
his drink offering, and sprinkled
the blood of his peace offerings,
upon the altar.
14 And he brought also the brasen
altar, which was before the Lord,
from the forefront of the house,
from between the altar and the
house of the Lord, and put it on
the north side of the altar.
15 And king Ahaz commanded
Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the

great altar burn the morning burnt
offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king’s burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with
the burnt offering of all the people
of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and
sprinkle upon it all the blood of the
burnt offering, and all the blood of
the sacrifice: and the brasen altar
shall be for me to inquire by.
16 Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.
17 ¶ And king Ahaz cut off the
borders of the bases, and removed
the laver from off them; and took
down the a sea from off the brasen
oxen that were under it, and put it
upon a pavement of stones.
18 And the covert for the sabbath
that they had built in the house, and
the king’s entry without, turned he
from the a house of the Lord for the
king of Assyria.
19 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of
Ahaz which he did, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
20 And a Ahaz slept with his fathers,
and was buried with his fathers in
the city of David: and Hezekiah his
son reigned in his stead.
Chapter 17
Hoshea reigns in Israel and is subject
to the Assyrians—The Israelites forsake
the Lord, worship idols, serve Baal, and
reject all that the Lord has given them—
The ten tribes are carried away captive
by the kings of Assyria—The land of
Israel (Samaria) is repopulated by other
people—Many forms of false worship are
found among the Samaritans.
In the twelfth year of Ahaz king
of Judah began Hoshea the son of
Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel
nine years.

2 And he did that which was evil in
the sight of the Lord, but not as the
kings of Israel that were before him.
3 ¶ Against him came up a Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave
him presents.
4 And the king of Assyria found
a 
conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had
sent messengers to So king of Egypt,
and brought no present to the king
of Assyria, as he had done year by
year: therefore the king of Assyria
shut him up, and bound him in
prison.
5 ¶ Then the king of a Assyria came
up throughout all the land, and
went up to Samaria, and besieged
it three years.
6 ¶ In the ninth year of Hoshea the
king of Assyria took a Samaria, and
b 
carried c Israel away into d Assyria,
and placed them in Halah and in
Habor by the river of Gozan, and
in the cities of the Medes.
7 For so it was, that the children of
Israel had a sinned against the Lord

up out of the land of Egypt, from
under the hand of Pharaoh king of
Egypt, and had feared other gods,
8 And walked in the statutes of the
a 
heathen, whom the Lord cast out
from before the children of Israel,
and of the kings of Israel, which
they had made.
9 And the children of Israel did
secretly those things that were not
right against the Lord their God,
and they built them high places in
all their cities, from the tower of
the watchmen to the fenced city.
10 And they set them up images
and a groves in every high hill, and
under every green tree:
11 And there they burnt incense in
all the high places, as did the heathen whom the Lord carried away

things to provoke the Lord to
anger:
12 For they served idols, whereof
the Lord had said unto them, Ye
shall a not do this thing.
13 Yet the Lord a testified against
Israel, and against Judah, by all the
b 
prophets, and by all the c seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways,
and keep my commandments and
my statutes, according to all the law
which I commanded your fathers,
and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.
14 Notwithstanding they would
a 
not hear, but b hardened their necks,
like to the neck of their fathers,
that did not c believe in the Lord
their God.
15 And they rejected his statutes,
and his covenant that he made with
their fathers, and his testimonies
which he testified against them;
and they followed vanity, and became a vain, and went after the heathen that were round about them,
concerning whom the Lord had
charged them, that they should not
do like them.
16 And they left all the commandments of the Lord their God, and
made them molten images, even
two a calves, and made a b grove, and
worshipped all the c host of heaven,
and served d Baal.
17 And they caused their sons and
their daughters to pass through the
a 
fire, and used b divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to
do c evil in the sight of the Lord, to
provoke him to anger.
18 Therefore the Lord was very
angry with Israel, and a removed
them out of his sight: there was none
left but the tribe of b Judah only.

19 Also Judah kept not the commandments of the Lord their God,
but walked in the statutes of Israel
which they made.
20 And the Lord a rejected all the
seed of Israel, and afflicted them,
and delivered them into the hand
of spoilers, until he had cast them
out of his sight.
21 For he rent Israel from the
house of David; and they made
Jeroboam the son of Nebat king:
and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the Lord, and made them
sin a great sin.
22 For the children of Israel walked
in all the sins of Jeroboam which
he did; they departed not from
them;
23 Until the Lord removed Israel
out of his sight, as he had said by
all his servants the a prophets. So
was b Israel c carried away out of
their own d land to Assyria unto this
day.
24 ¶ And the king of Assyria
a 
brought men from Babylon, and
from Cuthah, and from Ava, and
from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities
of Samaria instead of the children of
Israel: and they possessed Samaria,
and dwelt in the cities thereof.
25 And so it was at the beginning
of their dwelling there, that they
feared not the Lord: therefore the
Lord sent lions among them, which
slew some of them.
26 Wherefore they spake to the
king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and
placed in the cities of Samaria, know
not the manner of the God of the
land: therefore he hath sent lions
among them, and, behold, they slay

them, because they know not the
manner of the God of the land.
27 Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one
of the priests whom ye brought
from thence; and let them go and
dwell there, and let him teach them
the manner of the God of the land.
28 Then one of the priests whom
they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el,
and taught them how they should
fear the Lord.
29 Howbeit every nation made gods
of their own, and put them in the
a 
houses of the high places which the
b 
Samaritans had made, every nation
in their cities wherein they dwelt.
30 And the men of Babylon made
Succoth-benoth, and the men of
Cuth made Nergal, and the men
of Hamath made Ashima,
31 And the Avites made Nibhaz
and Tartak, and the Sepharvites
burnt their a children in fire to
Adrammelech and Anammelech,
the gods of Sepharvaim.
32 So they feared the Lord, and
made unto themselves of the lowest
of them priests of the high places,
which sacrificed for them in the
houses of the high places.
33 They feared the Lord, and
served their own gods, after the
manner of the nations whom they
carried away from thence.
34 Unto this day they do after the
former manners: they fear not the
Lord, neither do they after their
statutes, or after their ordinances,
or after the law and commandment
which the Lord commanded the
children of Jacob, whom he named
a 
Israel;
35 With whom the Lord had made
a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not a fear other b gods,
nor bow yourselves to them, nor
serve them, nor sacrifice to them:

40 Howbeit they did not hearken,
but they did after their former
manner.
41 So these nations feared the
Lord, and served their graven images, both their children, and their
children’s children: as did their
fathers, so do they unto this day.

Hezekiah reigns in righteousness in Judah—He destroys idolatry and breaks
the brazen serpent made by Moses because the children of Israel burn incense
to it—Sennacherib, king of Assyria, invades Judah—In a blasphemous speech,
Rabshakeh asks Jerusalem to surrender
to the Assyrians.
Now it came to pass in the third
year of Hoshea son of Elah king
of Israel, that a Hezekiah the son of
Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
2 Twenty and five years old was
he when he began to a reign; and he
reigned twenty and nine years in
Jerusalem. His mother’s name also
was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.
3 And he did that which was right
in the sight of the Lord, according
to all that David his father did.

and brake the b images, and c cut
down the groves, and brake in pieces
the brasen d serpent that Moses had
made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to
it: and he called it Nehushtan.
5 He a trusted in the Lord God of
Israel; so that after him was none
like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.
6 For he a clave to the Lord, and
departed not from following him,
but kept his commandments, which
the Lord commanded Moses.
7 And the Lord was with him; and
he prospered whithersoever he went
forth: and he rebelled against the
king of Assyria, and served him not.
8 He smote the Philistines, even
unto Gaza, and the borders thereof,
from the tower of the watchmen to
the fenced city.
9 ¶ And it came to pass in the
fourth year of king Hezekiah, which
was the seventh year of Hoshea son
of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up
against Samaria, and besieged it.
10 And at the end of three years
they took it: even in the sixth year
of Hezekiah, that is the ninth year
of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria
was taken.
11 And the king of Assyria did
carry away a Israel unto Assyria, and
put them in Halah and in Habor by
the river of Gozan, and in the cities
of the Medes:
12 Because they a obeyed not the
voice of the Lord their God, but
transgressed his covenant, and all
that Moses the servant of the Lord
commanded, and would not hear
them, nor do them.
13 ¶ Now in the a fourteenth year of
king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king
of Assyria come up against all the
fenced cities of Judah, and took them.

to the king of Assyria to Lachish,
saying, I have offended; return from
me: that which thou puttest on me
will I bear. And the king of Assyria
appointed unto Hezekiah king of
Judah three hundred talents of
silver and thirty talents of gold.
15 And a Hezekiah gave him all the
silver that was found in the house
of the Lord, and in the treasures of
the king’s house.
16 At that time did Hezekiah cut
off the gold from the doors of the
temple of the Lord, and from the
pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the
king of Assyria.
17 ¶ And the king of Assyria a sent
b 
Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came
to Jerusalem. And when they were
come up, they came and stood by the
c 
conduit of the upper pool, which is
in the highway of the fuller’s field.
18 And when they had called to
the king, there came out to them
a 
Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which
was over the household, and Shebna
the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph
the recorder.
19 And Rab-shakeh said unto
them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah,
Thus saith the great king, the king
of Assyria, What confidence is this
wherein thou trustest?
20 Thou sayest, (but they are but
vain words,) I have counsel and
strength for the war. Now on whom
dost thou trust, that thou rebellest
against me?
21 Now, behold, thou trustest upon

it will go into his hand, and pierce
it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto
all that trust on him.

in the Lord our God: is not that he,
whose high places and whose altars
Hezekiah hath taken away, and
hath said to Judah and Jerusalem,
Ye shall worship before this altar
in Jerusalem?
23 Now therefore, I pray thee, give
pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two
thousand horses, if thou be able on
thy part to set riders upon them.
24 How then wilt thou turn away
the face of one captain of the least
of my master’s servants, and put thy
trust on Egypt for chariots and for
horsemen?
25 Am I now come up without the
Lord against this place to destroy it?
The Lord said to me, Go up against
this land, and destroy it.
26 Then said Eliakim the son of
Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto
Rab-shakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to
thy servants in the Syrian language;
for we understand it: and talk not
with us in the Jews’ language in
the ears of the people that are on
the wall.
27 But Rab-shakeh said unto
them, Hath my master sent me to
thy master, and to thee, to speak
these words? hath he not sent me to
the men which sit on the wall, that
they may eat their own dung, and
drink their own piss with you?
28 Then Rab-shakeh stood and
cried with a loud voice in the Jews’
a 
language, and spake, saying, Hear
the word of the great king, the king
of Assyria:
29 Thus saith the king, Let not
Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall
not be able to deliver you out of
his hand:
30 Neither let Hezekiah make you
trust in the Lord, saying, The Lord
will surely deliver us, and this city
shall not be delivered into the hand
of the king of Assyria.
31 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for
thus saith the king of Assyria, Make
an agreement with me by a present,
and come out to me, and then eat ye
	28	a	 2 Chr. 32:18 (5–26).

every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye
every one the waters of his cistern:
32 Until I come and take you away
to a land like your own land, a land
of corn and wine, a land of bread
and vineyards, a land of oil olive
and of honey, that ye may live, and
not die: and hearken not unto
Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you,
saying, The Lord will deliver us.
33 Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out
of the hand of the king of Assyria?
34 Where are the gods of Hamath,
and of Arpad? where are the gods
of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?
have they delivered Samaria out
of mine hand?
35 Who are they among all the
gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine
hand, that the Lord should deliver
Jerusalem out of mine hand?
36 But the people held their peace,
and answered him not a word: for
the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
37 Then came Eliakim the son of
Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and
Joah the son of Asaph the recorder,
to Hezekiah with their clothes rent,
and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
Chapter 19
Hezekiah seeks counsel from Isaiah to
save Jerusalem—Isaiah prophesies the
defeat of the Assyrians and the death
of Sennacherib—Hezekiah prays for
deliverance—Sennacherib sends a blasphemous letter—Isaiah prophesies that
the Assyrians will be destroyed and that
a remnant of Judah will flourish—An
angel slays 185,000 Assyrians—Sennacherib is slain by his sons.
And it came to pass, when king
Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his
clothes, and covered himself with
sackcloth, and went into the a house
of the Lord.

Ps. 73:17 (16–17).

2 Kings 19:2–22

2 And he sent Eliakim, which was
over the household, and Shebna
the a scribe, and the elders of the
priests, covered with sackcloth, to
Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
3 And they said unto him, Thus
saith Hezekiah, This day is a day
of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy: for the children are come to
the birth, and there is not strength
to bring forth.
4 It may be the Lord thy God will
hear all the words of Rab-shakeh,
whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living
God; and will reprove the words
which the Lord thy God hath heard:
wherefore lift up thy a prayer for the
b 
remnant that are left.
5 So the servants of king Hezekiah
came to Isaiah.
6 ¶ And a Isaiah said unto them,
Thus shall ye say to your master,
Thus saith the Lord, Be not afraid
of the words which thou hast heard,
with which the servants of the king
of Assyria have blasphemed me.
7 Behold, I will send a blast upon
him, and he shall hear a rumour,
and shall return to his own land;
and I will cause him to fall by the
sword in his own land.
8 ¶ So Rab-shakeh returned, and
found the king of Assyria warring
against Libnah: for he had heard
that he was departed from Lachish.
9 And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he
is come out to fight against thee: he
sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,
10 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah
king of Judah, saying, Let not thy
God in whom thou trustest a deceive
thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be
delivered into the hand of the king
of Assyria.
11 Behold, thou hast heard what
the kings of Assyria have done to
all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?

and Rezeph, and the children of
Eden which were in Thelasar?
13 Where is the king of Hamath,
and the king of Arpad, and the king
of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena,
and Ivah?
14 ¶ And Hezekiah received the
letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went
up into the house of the Lord, and
spread it before the Lord.
15 And Hezekiah prayed before
the Lord, and said, O Lord God of
Israel, which dwellest between the
a 
cherubims, thou art the b God, even
thou alone, of all the kingdoms of
the earth; thou hast c made heaven
and earth.
16 Lord, bow down thine ear, and
hear: open, Lord, thine eyes, and
see: and hear the words of Sen­
nacherib, which hath sent him to
reproach the living God.
17 Of a truth, Lord, the kings of
Assyria have destroyed the nations
and their lands,
18 And have cast their gods into the
fire: for they were no gods, but the
work of men’s hands, wood and stone:
therefore they have destroyed them.
19 Now therefore, O Lord our God,
I beseech thee, save thou us out of
his hand, that all the kingdoms
of the earth may know that thou
art the Lord God, even thou only.
20 ¶ Then Isaiah the son of Amoz
sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith
the Lord God of Israel, That which
thou hast a prayed to me against
Sennacherib king of Assyria I have
heard.
21 This is the word that the Lord
hath spoken concerning him; The
a 
virgin the daughter of Zion hath
despised thee, and b laughed thee to
scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem
hath shaken her head at thee.
22 Whom hast thou reproached

and blasphemed? and against whom
hast thou exalted thy voice, and
lifted up thine eyes on high? even
against the Holy One of Israel.
23 By thy messengers thou hast
reproached the Lord, and hast said,
With the a multitude of my chariots
I am come up to the height of the
mountains, to the sides of Lebanon,
and will cut down the tall cedar
trees thereof, and the choice fir
trees thereof: and I will enter into
the lodgings of his borders, and into
the forest of his Carmel.
24 I have digged and drunk strange
waters, and with the sole of my feet
have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.
25 Hast thou not heard long ago
how I have done it, and of ancient
times that I have formed it? now
have I brought it to pass, that thou
shouldest be to lay waste fenced
cities into ruinous heaps.
26 Therefore their inhabitants
were of small power, they were
dismayed and confounded; they
were as the a grass of the field, and
as the green herb, as the grass on
the housetops, and as corn blasted
before it be grown up.
27 But I know thy abode, and thy
going out, and thy coming in, and
thy rage against me.
28 Because thy rage against me
and thy tumult is come up into
mine ears, therefore I will put my
hook in thy nose, and my bridle in
thy lips, and I will turn thee back
by the way by which thou camest.
29 And this shall be a sign unto
thee, Ye shall eat this year such
things as grow of themselves, and in
the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third
year sow ye, and reap, and plant
vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.
30 And the a remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall
yet again take root downward, and
bear fruit upward.

31 For out of Jerusalem shall go
forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the a zeal
of the Lord of hosts shall do this.
32 Therefore thus saith the Lord
concerning the king of Assyria, He
shall not come into this city, nor
shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank
against it.
33 By the way that he came, by the
same shall he return, and shall not
come into this city, saith the Lord.
34 For I will a defend this city, to
save it, for mine own sake, and for

35 ¶ And it came to pass that night,
that the a angel of the Lord went
out, and b smote in the camp of the
c 
Assyrians an hundred fourscore
and five thousand: and when they
arose early in the morning, behold,
they were all dead corpses.
36 So Sennacherib king of Assyria
departed, and went and returned,
and dwelt at Nineveh.
37 And it came to pass, as he was
worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and
Sharezer his sons smote him with
the sword: and they escaped into the
land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon
his son reigned in his stead.
Chapter 20
Hezekiah is told he will die and pleads
with the Lord; his life is lengthened fifteen years—The shadow goes back ten
degrees on the sundial of Ahaz—Isaiah
prophesies the Babylonian captivity of
Judah.
In those days was a Hezekiah sick
unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him,
and said unto him, Thus saith the
Lord, Set thine house in order; for
thou shalt b die, and not live.
2 Then he turned his face to the

3 I beseech thee, O Lord, remember now how I have walked before
thee in truth and with a perfect
heart, and have done that which is
good in thy sight. And Hezekiah
wept sore.
4 And it came to pass, afore Isaiah
was gone out into the middle court,
that the word of the Lord came to
him, saying,
5 Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the
captain of my people, Thus saith the
Lord, the God of David thy father, I
have heard thy prayer, I have seen
thy tears: behold, I will a heal thee:
on the third day thou shalt go up
unto the house of the Lord.
6 And I will add unto thy a days
fifteen years; and I will deliver thee
and this city out of the hand of the
king of Assyria; and I will defend
this city for mine own sake, and for
my servant David’s sake.
7 And Isaiah said, Take a lump of
figs. And they took and laid it on
the boil, and he recovered.
8 ¶ And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the a sign that the
Lord will heal me, and that I shall
go up into the house of the Lord
the third day ?
9 And Isaiah said, This sign shalt
thou have of the Lord, that the Lord
will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the a shadow go forward
ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?
10 And Hezekiah answered, It is
a light thing for the a shadow to
go down ten degrees: nay, but let
the shadow return backward ten
degrees.
11 And Isaiah the prophet cried
unto the Lord: and he brought the
shadow ten degrees a backward, by
which it had gone down in the dial
of Ahaz.
12 ¶ At that time a  Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of

unto Hezekiah: for he had heard
that Hezekiah had been sick.
13 And Hezekiah hearkened unto
them, and shewed them all the house
of his precious things, the silver,
and the gold, and the spices, and
the precious ointment, and all the
house of his armour, and all that
was found in his a treasures: there
was nothing in his house, nor in
all his dominion, that Hezekiah
shewed them not.
14 ¶ Then came Isaiah the prophet
unto king Hezekiah, and said unto
him, What said these men? and
from whence came they unto thee?
And Hezekiah said, They are come
from a far country, even from
Babylon.
15 And he said, What have they
seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
answered, All the things that are in
mine house have they seen: there
is nothing among my treasures that
I have not shewed them.
16 And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah,
Hear the word of the Lord.
17 Behold, the days come, that
all that is in thine house, and that
which thy fathers have laid up in
store unto this day, shall be a carried
into Babylon: nothing shall be left,
saith the Lord.
18 And of thy a sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they
shall be b eunuchs in the palace of
the king of Babylon.
19 Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah,
Good is the word of the Lord which
thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it
not good, if peace and truth be in
my days?
20 ¶ And the rest of the acts of
Hezekiah, and all his might, and

21 And Hezekiah slept with his

reigned in his stead.
Chapter 21
Manasseh turns Judah to idolatry,
even sacrificing a son to a heathen
god—Prophets foretell the destruction
of Judah and Jerusalem—Wickedness
continues under Amon.
a 
Manasseh was twelve years old
when he began to reign, and reigned
fifty and five years in Jerusalem.
And his mother’s name was Hephzibah.
2 And he did that which was a evil
in the sight of the Lord, after the
b 
abominations of the heathen,
whom the Lord cast out before the
children of Israel.
3 For he built up again the a high
places which Hezekiah his father
had destroyed; and he reared up
altars for Baal, and made a b grove,
as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the c host of heaven, and
served them.
4 And he built a altars in the b house
of the Lord, of which the Lord said,
In Jerusalem will I put my c name.
5 And he built altars for all the
host of heaven in the two a courts
of the house of the Lord.
6 And he made his son pass through
the a fire, and observed times, and
used b  enchantments, and dealt
with c familiar spirits and wizards:
he wrought much wickedness in
the sight of the Lord, to provoke
him to anger.
7 And he set a graven a image of
the grove that he had made in the
house, of which the Lord said to
David, and to Solomon his son,

Israel move any more out of the land
which I gave their fathers; only if
they will observe to do according
to all that I have commanded them,
and according to all the law that my
servant Moses commanded them.
9 But they hearkened not: and
Manasseh seduced them to do more
a 
evil than did the nations whom the
Lord destroyed before the children
of Israel.
10 ¶ And the Lord spake by his
servants the prophets, saying,
11 Because a Manasseh king of Judah hath done these b abominations,
and hath done c wickedly above all
that the Amorites did, which were
before him, and hath made Judah
also to sin with his idols:
12 Therefore thus saith the Lord
God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and
Judah, that whosoever heareth of
it, both his ears shall a tingle.
13 And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the
plummet of the house of Ahab: and
I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it
upside down.
14 And I will forsake the remnant
of mine inheritance, and a deliver
them into the hand of their enemies;
and they shall become a prey and
a spoil to all their enemies;
15 Because they have done that
which was evil in my sight, and have
provoked me to anger, since the
day their fathers came forth out of
Egypt, even unto this day.

made Judah to sin, in doing that
which was evil in the sight of the
Lord.
17 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of
a 
Manasseh, and all that he did, and
his sin that he sinned, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
18 And Manasseh slept with his
fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden
of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned
in his stead.
19 ¶ a Amon was twenty and two
years old when he began to reign,
and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was
Meshullemeth, the daughter of
Haruz of Jotbah.
20 And he did that which was evil in
the sight of the Lord, as his father
Manasseh did.
21 And he walked in all the way
that his father walked in, and served
the idols that his father served, and
worshipped them:
22 And he forsook the Lord God
of his fathers, and walked not in
the way of the Lord.
23 ¶ And the servants of Amon
conspired against him, and slew
the king in his own house.
24 And the people of the land slew
all them that had conspired against
king Amon; and the people of the
land made a Josiah his son king in
his stead.
25 Now the rest of the acts of Amon
which he did, are they not written
in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Judah?
26 And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and
Josiah his son reigned in his stead.

fathers—Huldah prophesies wrath upon

a 
Josiah was eight years old when
he began to reign, and he reigned
thirty and one years in Jerusalem.
And his mother’s name was Jedidah,
the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.
2 And he did that which was right
in the sight of the Lord, and walked
in all the way of David his father,
and turned not aside to the right
hand or to the left.
3 ¶ And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the
king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah,
the son of Meshullam, the scribe,
to the house of the Lord, saying,
4 Go up to a Hilkiah the high priest,
that he may sum the b silver which is
brought into the house of the Lord,
which the keepers of the door have
gathered of the people:
5 And let them deliver it into the
hand of the doers of the work, that
have the oversight of the house
of the Lord: and let them give it
to the doers of the work which is
in the house of the Lord, to repair
the a breaches of the house,
6 Unto carpenters, and builders,
and masons, and to buy timber and
hewn stone to repair the house.
7 Howbeit there was no a reckoning made with them of the money
that was delivered into their hand,
because they dealt faithfully.
8 ¶ And Hilkiah the high priest
said unto Shaphan the scribe, I
have found the a book of the law in
the house of the Lord. And Hilkiah
gave the book to Shaphan, and he
read it.
9 And Shaphan the scribe came
to the king, and brought the king
word again, and said, Thy servants
have gathered the money that was
found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that
do the work, that have the oversight
of the house of the Lord.

10 And Shaphan the scribe shewed
the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest
hath delivered me a book. And
Shaphan read it before the king.
11 And it came to pass, when the
king had heard the a words of the book
of the law, that he rent his clothes.
12 And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and a Ahikam the
son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son
of Michaiah, and Shaphan the
scribe, and Asahiah a servant of
the king’s, saying,
13 Go ye, inquire of the Lord
for me, and for the people, and for
all Judah, concerning the words of
this book that is found: for great is
the a wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us, because our fathers
have not hearkened unto the words
of this book, to b do according unto
all that which is written concerning us.
14 So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan,
and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the
prophetess, the wife of Shallum the
son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas,
keeper of the wardrobe; (now she
dwelt in Jerusalem in the a college;)
and they communed with her.
15 ¶ And she said unto them, Thus
saith the Lord God of Israel, Tell
the man that sent you to me,
16 Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I
will bring evil upon this place, and
upon the inhabitants thereof, even
all the words of the a book which
the king of Judah hath read:
17 Because they have forsaken me,
and have burned incense unto other
gods, that they might a provoke me
to anger with all the works of their
hands; therefore my wrath shall be
kindled against this place, and shall
not be quenched.
18 But to the king of Judah which
sent you to inquire of the Lord, thus
shall ye say to him, Thus saith the

19 Because thine heart was tender,
and thou hast a humbled thyself before the Lord, when thou heardest
what I spake against this place, and
against the inhabitants thereof,
that they should become a b desolation and a c curse, and hast rent
thy clothes, and wept before me; I
also have heard thee, saith the Lord.
20 Behold therefore, I will gather
thee unto thy fathers, and thou
shalt be gathered into thy grave
in a peace; and thine eyes shall not
see all the evil which I will bring
upon this place. And they brought
the king word again.
Chapter 23
Josiah reads the book of the covenant to the
people—They covenant to keep the commandments—Josiah overturns the worship
of false gods, removes the sodomites, and
puts down idolatry—Idolatrous priests are
slain—Judah holds a solemn Passover—
Egypt subjects the land of Judah.
And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.
2 And the king went up into the
house of the Lord, and all the men
of Judah and all the inhabitants of
Jerusalem with him, and the priests,
and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he
a 
read in their ears all the words of
the book of the covenant which was
found in the house of the Lord.
3 ¶ And the king stood by a a pillar,
and made a b covenant before the
Lord, to c walk after the Lord, and
to keep his commandments and his
testimonies and his statutes with
all their heart and all their soul, to
perform the words of this covenant
that were written in this book. And
all the people stood to the covenant.

4 And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the a priests
of the second order, and the b keepers of the door, to bring forth out
of the temple of the Lord all the
vessels that were made for Baal,
and for the grove, and for all the
host of heaven: and he burned them
without Jerusalem in the fields of
Kidron, and carried the ashes of
them unto Beth-el.
5 And he put down the idolatrous
a 
priests, whom the kings of Judah
had ordained to burn incense in
the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about
Jerusalem; them also that burned
incense unto Baal, to the sun, and
to the moon, and to the planets,
and to all the host of heaven.
6 And he brought out the a grove
from the house of the Lord, without
Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron,
and burned it at the brook Kidron,
and stamped it small to powder,
and cast the powder thereof upon
the graves of the children of the
people.
7 And he brake down the houses
of the a sodomites, that were by the
house of the Lord, where the women
wove hangings for the grove.
8 And he brought all the priests
out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the
priests had burned incense, from
Geba to Beer-sheba, and brake down
the high places of the gates that
were in the entering in of the gate
of Joshua the governor of the city,
which were on a man’s left hand at
the gate of the city.
9 Nevertheless the priests of the
high places a came not up to the altar
of the Lord in Jerusalem, but they
did eat of the b unleavened bread
among their brethren.

11 And he took away the horses
that the kings of Judah had given
to the sun, at the entering in of
the house of the Lord, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamber­
lain, which was in the suburbs,
and burned the chariots of the sun
with fire.
12 And the altars that were on the
top of the a upper chamber of Ahaz,
which the kings of Judah had made,
and the altars which Manasseh had
made in the two courts of the house
of the Lord, did the king beat down,
and brake them down from thence,
and cast the dust of them into the
brook Kidron.
13 And the a high places that were
before Jerusalem, which were on
the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king
of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth
the abomination of the Zidonians,
and for Chemosh the abomination
of the Moabites, and for Milcom
the abomination of the children of
Ammon, did the king defile.
14 And he brake in pieces the images, and a cut down the groves, and
filled their places with the bones
of men.

made Israel to sin, had made, both

brake down, and burned the high

16 And as Josiah turned himself,
he spied the sepulchres that were
there in the mount, and sent, and
took the bones out of the sepulchres,
and burned them upon the altar, and

polluted it, according to the word
of the Lord which the man of God
proclaimed, who proclaimed these
words.
17 Then he said, What title is that
that I see? And the men of the city
told him, It is the a sepulchre of the
man of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things
that thou hast done against the altar of Beth-el.
18 And he said, Let him alone; let
no man move his bones. So they let
his bones alone, with the bones of
the prophet that came out of Samaria.
19 And all the houses also of the
high places that were in the cities of
Samaria, which the kings of Israel
had made to provoke the Lord to
anger, Josiah took away, and did to
them according to all the acts that
he had done in Beth-el.
20 And he slew all the priests of
the a high places that were there
upon the altars, and b burned men’s
bones upon them, and returned to
Jerusalem.
21 ¶ And the king commanded all
the people, saying, Keep the a passover unto the Lord your God, as it is
written in the book of this covenant.
22 Surely there was not holden
such a a passover from the days of
the judges that judged Israel, nor in
all the days of the kings of Israel,
nor of the kings of Judah;
23 But in the eighteenth year of
king Josiah, wherein this passover was
holden to the Lord in Jerusalem.
24 ¶ Moreover the a workers with
b 
familiar spirits, and the wizards,
and the images, and the idols, and
all the abominations that were
spied in the land of Judah and in
Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that
he might perform the words of the
law which were written in the book

25 And like unto him was there
no a king before him, that b turned
to the Lord with all his heart, and
with all his soul, and with all his
might, according to all the law of
Moses; neither after him arose there
any like him.
26 ¶ Notwithstanding the Lord
turned not from the fierceness of
his great wrath, wherewith his anger
was kindled against Judah, because
of all the provocations that Manasseh had a provoked him withal.
27 And the Lord said, I will a remove Judah also out of my sight, as
I have b removed Israel, and will cast
off this city c Jerusalem which I have
chosen, and the house of which I
said, My name shall be there.
28 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not

29 ¶ In his days a Pharaoh-nechoh
king of Egypt went up against
the king of Assyria to the river
Euphrates: and king b Josiah went
against him; and he slew him at
Megiddo, when he had seen him.
30 And his servants carried him
in a chariot dead from Megiddo,
and brought him to Jerusalem, and
buried him in his own sepulchre.
And the people of the land took
a 
Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and
anointed him, and made him king
in his father’s stead.
31 ¶ Jehoahaz was twenty and three
years old when he began to reign;
and he reigned three months in
Jerusalem. And his mother’s name
was Hamutal, the daughter of Jere­
miah of Libnah.
32 And he did that which was evil
in the sight of the Lord, according
to all that his fathers had done.

33 And Pharaoh-nechoh put him

Hamath, that he might not reign
in Jerusalem; and put the land to
a tribute of an hundred talents of
silver, and a talent of gold.
34 And Pharaoh-nechoh made
Eliakim the son of Josiah king in
the room of Josiah his father, and
turned his name to a Jehoiakim, and
took Jehoahaz away: and he came
to Egypt, and died there.
35 And Jehoiakim gave the silver
and the gold to Pharaoh; but he
taxed the land to give the money
according to the commandment of
Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and
the gold of the people of the land,
of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaoh-nechoh.
36 ¶ Jehoiakim was twenty and
five years old when he began to
reign; and he reigned eleven years
in Jerusalem. And his mother’s
name was Zebudah, the daughter
of Pedaiah of Rumah.
37 And he did that which was a evil
in the sight of the Lord, according
to all that his fathers had done.

Jerusalem is besieged and taken by
Nebuchadnezzar—Many of the people of Judah are carried captive into
Babylon—Zedekiah becomes king in
Jerusalem—He rebels against Babylon.
In his days a Nebuchadnezzar king
of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim
became his servant three years:
then he turned and rebelled against
him.
2 And the Lord sent a against him
bands of the b Chaldees, and bands
of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children
of Ammon, and sent them against

3 Surely at the commandment of
the Lord came this upon Judah, to
remove them out of his sight, for
the a sins of b Manasseh, according
to all that he did;
4 And also for the innocent blood
that he a shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the
Lord would not pardon.
5 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of
a 
Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are
they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Judah?
6 So a Jehoiakim slept with his
fathers: and Jehoiachin his son
reigned in his stead.
7 And the king of Egypt came not
again any more out of his land: for
the king of Babylon had taken from
the river of Egypt unto the river
Euphrates all that pertained to the
king of Egypt.
8 ¶ Jehoiachin was a eighteen years
old when he began to reign, and he
reigned in Jerusalem three months.
And his mother’s name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan
of Jerusalem.
9 And he did that which was evil
in the sight of the Lord, according
to all that his father had done.
10 ¶ At that time the servants of
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
came up against Jerusalem, and the
city was a besieged.
11 And a Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon came against the city, and
his servants did besiege it.
12 And a Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of  b Babylon,
he, and his mother, and his servants,
and his princes, and his off­icers: and
the king of Babylon took him in the

house, and cut in pieces all the c vessels of gold which d Solomon king
of Israel had made in the temple
of the Lord, as the Lord had said.
14 And he a carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all
the mighty men of valour, even ten
thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and b smiths: none remained,
save the poorest sort of the people
of the land.
15 And he carried away a Jehoia­
chin to Babylon, and the king’s
mother, and the king’s wives, and
his officers, and the b mighty of the
land, those carried he into c captivity
from Jerusalem to d Babylon.
16 And all the men of might, even
seven thousand, and craftsmen and
smiths a thousand, all that were
strong and apt for war, even them
the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.
17 ¶ And the king of Babylon made
a 
Mattaniah his father’s brother king
in his stead, and changed his name
to b Zedekiah.
18 a Zedekiah was twenty and one
years old when he began to reign,
and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name
was Hamutal, the daughter of Jere­
miah of Libnah.
19 And he did that which was a evil
in the sight of the Lord, according
to all that Jehoiakim had done.
20 For through the anger of the
Lord it came to pass in Jerusalem
and Judah, until he had cast them
out from his presence, that a Zedekiah b rebelled against the king of
Babylon.

Nebuchadnezzar again besieges Jerusalem—Zedekiah is captured, Jerusalem
and the temple are destroyed, and most
of the people of Judah are carried into
Babylon—Gedaliah, left to govern the
remnant, is slain—The remnant flee
to Egypt—Jehoiachin is shown favor
in Babylon.
And it came to pass in the a ninth
year of his reign, in the tenth month,
in the tenth day of the month, that
b 
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
came, he, and all his host, against
Jerusalem, and pitched against
it; and they c built forts against it
round about.
2 And the city was besieged unto
the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
3 And on the ninth day of the fourth
month the famine prevailed in the
city, and there was no bread for the
people of the land.
4 ¶ And the a city was b broken up,
and all the men of war fled by night
by the way of the gate between two
walls, which is by the king’s garden:
(now the Chaldees were against the
city round about:) and the king went
the way toward the plain.
5 And the army of the Chaldees
a 
pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho:
and all his army were b scattered
from him.
6 So they took the a  king, and
brought him up to the king of
b 
Babylon to Riblah; and they gave
c 
judgment upon him.

eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him

him to c Babylon.
8 ¶ And in the fifth month, on the
seventh day of the month, which is
the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came
a 
Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard,
a servant of the king of Babylon,
unto Jerusalem:
9 And he a burnt the b house of the
Lord, and the king’s house, and all
the houses of Jerusalem, and every
great man’s house c burnt he with fire.
10 And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of
the guard, brake down the walls of
Jerusalem round about.
11 Now the rest of the people that
were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of
Babylon, with the remnant of the
multitude, did Nebuzar-adan the
captain of the guard a carry away.
12 But the captain of the guard
left of the a poor of the land to be
vinedressers and husbandmen.
13 And the a pillars of brass that
were in the house of the Lord, and
the b bases, and the brasen c sea that
was in the house of the Lord, did the
Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to d Babylon.
14 And the a pots, and the shovels,
and the b snuffers, and the spoons,
and all the vessels of brass wherewith
they ministered, took they away.
15 And the firepans, and the bowls,
and such things as were of gold, in
gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.
16 The two pillars, one sea, and
the bases which Solomon had made
for the house of the Lord; the brass
of all these a vessels was without
weight.

upon it was brass: and the height of
the chapiter three cubits; and the
wreathen work, and pomegranates
upon the chapiter round about, all
of brass: and like unto these had the
second pillar with wreathen work.
18 ¶ And the captain of the guard
took a Seraiah the chief priest, and
Zephaniah the second priest, and the
b 
three keepers of the door:
19 And out of the city he took an
officer that was set over the a men of
war, and five men of them that were
in the king’s presence, which were
found in the city, and the principal
scribe of the host, which mustered
the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land
that were found in the city:
20 And Nebuzar-adan captain of
the guard took these, and brought
them to the king of Babylon to
Riblah:
21 And the king of Babylon smote
them, and a slew them at Riblah in
the land of Hamath. So Judah was
carried away out of their land.
22 ¶ And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
had left, even over them he made
a 
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the
son of Shaphan, ruler.
23 And when all the captains of the
armies, they and their men, heard
that the king of Babylon had made
Gedaliah governor, there came to
Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael
the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan
the son of Careah, and Seraiah the
son of Tanhumeth the Netopha­

it shall be well with you.
25 But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of
the seed royal, came, and ten men
with him, and smote Gedaliah, that
he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.
26 And all the people, both small
and great, and the captains of the
armies, arose, and came to Egypt:
for they were afraid of the Chaldees.
27 ¶ And it came to pass in the
seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah,

in the twelfth month, on the seven
and twentieth day of the month, that
Evil-merodach king of Babylon in
the year that he began to reign did
lift up the head of Jehoiachin king
of Judah out of prison;

and set his throne above the throne
of the kings that were with him in
Babylon;

his life.
30 And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the
king, a daily rate for every day, all
the days of his life.

Now the sons of a Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was the firstborn; but, forasmuch as he defiled
his father’s b bed, his birthright was
given unto the c sons of d Joseph the
son of Israel: and the genealogy is not
to be reckoned after the birthright.

away captive: he was prince of the

lies, when the genealogy of their

chief, Jeiel, and Zechariah,
8 And Bela the son of Azaz, the
son of Shema, the son of Joel, who
dwelt in Aroer, even unto Nebo and
a 
Baal-meon:
9 And eastward he inhabited unto
the entering in of the wilderness
from the river Euphrates: because
their cattle were multiplied in the
land of a Gilead.
10 And in the days of Saul they
made war with the Hagarites, who
fell by their hand: and they dwelt
in their tents throughout all the
east land of Gilead.
11 ¶ And the children of Gad dwelt
over against them, in the land of
Bashan unto Salchah:
12 Joel the chief, and Shapham
the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat
in Bashan.
13 And their brethren of the house
of their fathers were, Michael, and
Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and
Jachan, and Zia, and Heber, seven.
14 These are the children of Abihail
the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah,

18 ¶ The sons of Reuben, and the
Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men able
to bear buckler and sword, and to
shoot with bow, and skilful in war,
were four and forty thousand seven
hundred and threescore, that went
out to the war.
19 And they made war with the
Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish,
and Nodab.
20 And they were a helped against
them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that
were with them: for they cried to
God in the battle, and he was b entreated of them; because they put
their c trust in him.
21 And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand,
and of sheep two hundred and
fifty thousand, and of asses two
thousand, and of men an hundred
thousand.
22 For there fell down many slain,
because the war was of God. And
they dwelt in their steads until the
captivity.
23 ¶ And the children of the half
tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land:
they increased from Bashan unto
Baal-hermon and Senir, and unto
mount Hermon.
24 And these were the heads of the
house of their fathers, even Epher,
and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and
Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous
men, and heads of the house of
their fathers.

26 And the God of Israel stirred

and the spirit of Tilgath-pilneser
king of Assyria, and he a carried

the b Gadites, and the half tribe of

was upon them, and the opening
thereof every morning pertained
to them.
28 And certain of them had the
charge of the ministering vessels,
that they should bring them in and
out by tale.
29 Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, and
all the instruments of the sanctuary,
and the fine flour, and the wine,
and the oil, and the frankincense,
and the spices.
30 And some of the sons of the
priests made the ointment of the
spices.
31 And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office
over the things that were made in
the pans.
32 And other of their brethren,
of the sons of the Kohathites, were
over the shewbread, to prepare it
every sabbath.
33 And these are the a singers, chief
of the fathers of the Levites, who remaining in the chambers were free:
for they were employed in that work
day and b night.
34 These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.
35 ¶ And in Gibeon dwelt the
father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose
wife’s name was Maachah:
36 And his firstborn son Abdon,
then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and
Ner, and Nadab,
37 And Gedor, and Ahio, and
Zechariah, and Mikloth.
38 And Mikloth begat Shimeam.
And they also dwelt with their
brethren at Jerusalem, over against
their brethren.
39 And Ner begat Kish; and Kish
begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan,
and Malchi-shua, and Abinadab,
and Esh-baal.
40 And the son of Jonathan was
Merib-baal: and Merib-baal begat
Micah.

41 And the sons of Micah were,
Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea,
and Ahaz.
42 And Ahaz begat Jarah; and
Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth,
and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza;
43 And Moza begat Binea; and
Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son,
Azel his son.
44 And Azel had six sons, whose
names are these, Azrikam, Bocheru,
and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and
Obadiah, and Hanan: these were the
sons of Azel.
Chapter 10
The Philistines defeat Israel—Saul dies
for his transgressions.
Now the a Philistines fought against
Israel; and the men of Israel fled
from before the Philistines, and fell
down slain in mount Gilboa.
2 And the Philistines followed
hard after Saul, and after his sons;
and the Philistines slew Jonathan,
and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua,
the sons of Saul.
3 And the battle went sore against
Saul, and the archers hit him, and
he was wounded of the archers.
4 Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust
me through therewith; lest these
uncircumcised come and abuse me.
But his armourbearer would not; for
he was sore afraid. So a Saul took a
sword, and fell upon it.
5 And when his armourbearer saw
that Saul was dead, he fell likewise
on the sword, and died.
6 So Saul died, and his three sons,
and all his house died together.
7 And when all the men of Israel
that were in the valley saw that they
fled, and that Saul and his sons
were dead, then they forsook their
cities, and fled: and the Philistines
came and dwelt in them.
8 ¶ And it came to pass on the
morrow, when the Philistines came
to strip the slain, that they found

Saul and his sons fallen in mount
Gilboa.
9 And when they had stripped him,
they took his head, and his armour,
and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings
unto their idols, and to the people.
10 And they put his armour in the
house of their gods, and fastened
his a head in the temple of Dagon.
11 ¶ And when all Jabesh-gilead
heard all that the Philistines had
done to Saul,
12 They arose, all the valiant men,
and took away the body of Saul, and
the bodies of his sons, and brought
them to Jabesh, and buried their
bones under the oak in Jabesh, and
fasted seven days.
13 ¶ So a Saul died for his b transgression which he committed against the
Lord, even against the word of
the Lord, which he kept not, and
also for asking counsel of one that
had a c familiar spirit, to inquire of it;
14 And inquired not of the Lord:
therefore he slew him, and turned
the kingdom unto a David the son
of Jesse.
Chapter 11
David is anointed king in Hebron—
He takes Zion, the City of David—His
valiant warriors are named and their
deeds recounted.
Then all Israel gathered themselves
to a David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
2 And moreover in time past, even
when Saul was king, thou wast he
that leddest out and broughtest in
Israel: and the Lord thy God said
unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler
over my people Israel.
3 Therefore came all the elders of
Israel to the king to Hebron; and
David made a covenant with them

in Hebron before the Lord; and they
anointed a David b king over Israel,
according to the word of the Lord
by Samuel.
4 ¶ And David and all Israel went
to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where
the a Jebusites were, the inhabitants
of the land.
5 And the inhabitants of Jebus
said to David, Thou shalt not come
hither. Nevertheless David took the
castle of Zion, which is the city of
David.
6 And David said, Whosoever
smiteth the Jebusites first shall be
chief and captain. So Joab the son
of Zeruiah went first up, and was
chief.
7 And David dwelt in the castle;
therefore they called it the a city
of David.
8 And he built the city round
about, even from Millo round about:
and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
9 So David waxed greater and
greater: for the Lord of hosts was
with him.
10 ¶ These also are the chief of
the a mighty men whom David had,
who strengthened themselves with
him in his kingdom, and with all
Israel, to make him king, according
to the word of the Lord concerning
Israel.
11 And this is the number of the
mighty men whom David had; Ja­
shobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief
of the captains: he lifted up his
spear against three hundred slain
by him at one time.
12 And after him was Eleazar the
son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was
one of the three a mighties.
13 He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines
were gathered together to battle,
where was a parcel of ground full
of barley; and the people fled from
before the Philistines.

14 And they set themselves in the
midst of that parcel, and delivered
it, and slew the Philistines; and
the Lord saved them by a great deliverance.
15 ¶ Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to
David, into the cave of Adullam;
and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
16 And David was then in the hold,
and the Philistines’ garrison was
then at Beth-lehem.
17 And David longed, and said,
Oh that one would give me drink
of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!
18 And the three brake through
the host of the Philistines, and drew
water out of the well of Beth-lehem,
that was by the gate, and took it,
and brought it to David: but David
would not drink of it, but poured
it out to the Lord,
19 And said, My God forbid it me,
that I should do this thing: shall I
drink the blood of these men that
have put their lives in jeopardy ?
for with the jeopardy of their lives
they brought it. Therefore he would
not drink it. These things did these
three mightiest.
20 ¶ And a Abishai the brother of
Joab, he was chief of the three: for
lifting up his spear against three
hundred, he slew them, and had a
b 
name among the three.
21 Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was
their captain: howbeit he attained
not to the first three.
22 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,
the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel,
who had done many acts; he slew
two lionlike men of Moab: also he
went down and slew a lion in a pit
in a snowy day.
23 And he slew an Egyptian, a
man of great stature, five cubits
high; and in the Egyptian’s hand
was a spear like a weaver’s beam;
and he went down to him with a
staff, and plucked the spear out of

564
the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him
with his own spear.
24 These things did Benaiah the
son of Jehoiada, and had the name
among the three mighties.
25 Behold, he was honourable
among the thirty, but attained not
to the first three: and David set him
over his guard.
26 ¶ Also the valiant men of the
armies were, a Asahel the brother of
Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of
Beth-lehem,
27 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez
the Pelonite,

Chapter 12
David’s mighty men are cataloged—The
armies of the tribes of Israel join David
at Hebron—Israel rejoices because of
King David.
Now these are they that came to
David to Ziklag, while he yet kept
himself a  close because of Saul
the son of Kish: and they were
among the mighty men, helpers of
the war.
2 They were armed with bows, and
could use both the right hand and
the a left in hurling stones and shooting
arrows out of a bow, even of Saul’s
brethren of Benjamin.
3 The chief was Ahiezer, then
Joash, the sons of Shemaah the
Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the
sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah,
and Jehu the Antothite,
4 And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a
mighty man among the thirty, and
over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and
Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad
the Gederathite,
5 Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah
the Haruphite,
6 Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam,
the Korhites,
7 And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the
sons of Jeroham of Gedor.
8 And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into
the hold to the wilderness men of
might, and men of war fit for the
battle, that could handle shield and
buckler, whose faces were like the
faces of lions, and were as swift as
the roes upon the mountains;
12	1	a	 or  confined.
	2	a	 Judg. 20:16.

9 Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,
10 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
11 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
12 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad
the ninth,
13 Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai
the eleventh.
14 These were of the sons of Gad,
captains of the host: one of the
least was over an hundred, and the
greatest over a thousand.
15 These are they that went over
Jordan in the first month, when it
had overflown all his banks; and
they put to flight all them of the
valleys, both toward the east, and
toward the west.
16 And there came of the children
of Benjamin and Judah to the hold
unto David.
17 And David went out to meet
them, and answered and said unto
them, If ye be come peaceably unto
me to help me, mine heart shall be
knit unto you: but if ye be come to
betray me to mine enemies, seeing
there is no wrong in mine hands,
the God of our fathers look thereon,
and rebuke it.
18 Then the spirit came upon a Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and
he said, Thine are we, David, and on
thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace,
peace be unto thee, and peace be to
thine helpers; for thy God helpeth
thee. Then David received them, and
made them captains of the band.
19 And there fell some of Manasseh
to David, when he came with the
Philistines against Saul to battle:
but they helped them not: for the
lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying,
He will a fall to his master Saul to
the jeopardy of our heads.
20 As he went to Ziklag, there fell
to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and
Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael,
and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai,
captains of the thousands that were
of Manasseh.

21 And they helped David against
the band of the rovers: for they were
all mighty men of valour, and were
captains in the host.
22 For at that time day by day
there came to David to help him,
until it was a great host, like the
host of God.
23 ¶ And these are the numbers of
the bands that were ready armed to
the war, and came to a David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul
to him, according to the word of
the Lord.
24 The children of Judah that bare
shield and spear were six thousand
and eight hundred, ready armed
to the war.
25 Of the children of Simeon,
mighty men of valour for the war,
seven thousand and one hundred.
26 Of the children of Levi four
thousand and six hundred.
27 And Jehoiada was the leader of
the Aaronites, and with him were
three thousand and seven hundred;
28 And Zadok, a young man mighty
of valour, and of his father’s house
twenty and two captains.
29 And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of a Saul, three
thousand: for hitherto the greatest
part of them had kept the ward of
the house of Saul.
30 And of the children of Ephraim
twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their
fathers.
31 And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which
were expressed by name, to come
and make David king.
32 And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had understanding of the a times, to know
what Israel ought to do; the heads
of them were two hundred; and all
their brethren were at their commandment.
33 Of Zebulun, such as went forth
to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand,
	23	a	 2 Sam. 2:4 (3–4);

566
which could keep rank: they were
not of double heart.
34 And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and
spear thirty and seven thousand.
35 And of the Danites expert in
war twenty and eight thousand and
six hundred.
36 And of Asher, such as went
forth to battle, expert in war, forty
thousand.
37 And on the other side of Jordan,
of the Reubenites, and the Gadites,
and of the half tribe of Manasseh,
with all manner of instruments of
war for the battle, an hundred and
twenty thousand.
38 All these men of war, that could
keep rank, came with a perfect
heart to Hebron, to make David
king over all Israel: and all the rest
also of Israel were of one heart to
make David king.
39 And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking:
for their brethren had prepared
for them.
40 Moreover they that were nigh
them, even unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on
asses, and on camels, and on mules,
and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes
of figs, and bunches of raisins, and
wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep
abundantly: for there was joy in
Israel.
Chapter 13
David fetches the ark from Kirjathjearim—Uzza is slain by the Lord
when he steadies the ark—The house
of Obed-edom prospers because they
care for the ark.
And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds,
and with every leader.
2 And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good
unto you, and that it be of the Lord
our God, let us send abroad unto our
brethren every where, that are left
in all the land of Israel, and with

them also to the priests and Levites
which are in their cities and suburbs,
that they may gather themselves
unto us:
3 And let us bring again the a ark
of our God to us: for we inquired
not at it in the days of Saul.
4 And all the a congregation said
that they would do so: for the
thing was right in the eyes of all
the people.
5 So David a gathered all Israel
together, from b Shihor of Egypt
even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from
Kirjath-jearim.
6 And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to
bring up thence the ark of God the
Lord, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it.
7 And they carried the ark of God
in a new cart out of the house of
Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave
the cart.
8 And David and all Israel played
before God with all their might,
and with a singing, and with harps,
and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with
trumpets.
9 ¶ And when they came unto the
threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put
forth his hand to hold the ark; for
the oxen stumbled.
10 And the anger of the Lord was
kindled against Uzza, and he smote
him, because he put his a hand to the
b 
ark: and there he died before God.
11 And David was displeased, because the Lord had made a a breach
upon Uzza: wherefore that place is
called Perez-uzza to this day.
12 And David was afraid of God
that day, saying, How shall I bring
the ark of God home to me?
13 So David brought not the a ark
home to himself to the city of David,

but carried it aside into the house
of Obed-edom the Gittite.
14 And the ark of God remained
with the family of Obed-edom in
his house three months. And the
Lord a blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.
Chapter 14
David marries wives, begets children,
and defeats the Philistines; his fame
spreads to all nations.
Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of
cedars, with masons and carpenters,
to build him an house.
2 And David perceived that the
Lord had confirmed him king over
Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up
on high, because of his people Israel.
3 ¶ And David took more a wives
at Jerusalem: and David begat more
sons and daughters.
4 Now these are the names of his
children which he had in Jerusalem;
Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan,
and Solomon,
5 And Ibhar, and Elishua, and
Elpalet,
6 And Nogah, and Nepheg, and
Japhia,
7 And Elishama, and Beeliada,
and Eliphalet.
8 ¶ And when the Philistines heard
that David was a anointed king over
all Israel, all the Philistines went
up to seek David. And David heard
of it, and went out against them.
9 And the Philistines came and
spread themselves in the valley of
Rephaim.
10 And David inquired of God,
saying, Shall I go up against the
Philistines? and wilt thou deliver
them into mine hand? And the
Lord said unto him, Go up; for I
will deliver them into thine hand.
11 So they came up to a  Baal-

perazim; and David smote them
there. Then David said, God hath
broken in upon mine enemies by
mine hand like the breaking forth
of waters: therefore they called the
name of that place Baal-perazim.
12 And when they had left their
a 
gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned
with fire.
13 And the a Philistines yet again
spread themselves abroad in the
valley.
14 Therefore David inquired again
of God; and God said unto him, Go
not up after them; turn away from
them, and come upon them over
against the mulberry trees.
15 And it shall be, when thou shalt
hear a sound of going in the tops of
the mulberry trees, that then thou
shalt go out to battle: for God is
gone forth before thee to smite the
host of the Philistines.
16 David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the
host of the Philistines from Gibeon
even to Gazer.
17 And the fame of David went out
into all lands; and the Lord brought
the fear of him upon all nations.
Chapter 15
David prepares a place for the ark—The
Levites bring the ark to Jerusalem—
They sing and minister before the Lord.
And David made him houses in the
city of David, and prepared a place
for the a ark of God, and pitched for
it a tent.
2 Then David said, None ought to
a 
carry the b ark of God but the c Levites: for them hath the Lord chosen to carry the ark of God, and to
minister unto him for ever.
3 And David gathered all Israel
together to Jerusalem, to bring up
the ark of the Lord unto his place,
which he had prepared for it.

and Abiathar the priests, and for
the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and
Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,
12 And said unto them, Ye are the
chief of the fathers of the Levites:
sanctify yourselves, both ye and your
brethren, that ye may bring up the
ark of the Lord God of Israel unto
the place that I have prepared for it.
13 For because ye did it not at the
first, the Lord our God made a
a 
breach upon us, for that we sought
him not after the due b order.
14 So the priests and the Levites
sanctified themselves to bring up
the ark of the Lord God of Israel.
15 And the children of the Levites
bare the a ark of God upon their
shoulders with the staves thereon,
as Moses commanded according to
the word of the Lord.
16 And David spake to the chief of
the Levites to appoint their brethren
to be the singers with instruments
of musick, psalteries and a harps
and cymbals, sounding, by lifting
up the voice with joy.
17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his

brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their
brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
18 And with them their brethren
of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben,
and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and
Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah,
and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and
Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the porters.
19 So the singers, Heman, Asaph,
and Ethan, were appointed to sound
with cymbals of brass;
20 And Zechariah, and Aziel, and
Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni,
and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;
21 And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh,
and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and
Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on
the Sheminith to excel.
22 And Chenaniah, chief of the
Levites, was for song: he instructed
about the song, because he was
skilful.
23 And Berechiah and Elkanah
were doorkeepers for the ark.
24 And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai,
and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and
Eliezer, the priests, did blow with
the a trumpets before the ark of
God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah
were doorkeepers for the ark.
25 ¶ So David, and the elders of
Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of
the covenant of the Lord out of
the house of Obed-edom with joy.
26 And it came to pass, when God
helped the Levites that bare the ark
of the covenant of the Lord, that
they a offered b seven bullocks and
seven rams.
27 And David was clothed with a
robe of fine linen, and all the Levites
that bare the ark, and the singers,
and Chenaniah the master of the
song with the singers: David also
had upon him an ephod of linen.
28 Thus all Israel brought up the

29 ¶ And it came to pass, as the ark
of the covenant of the Lord came
to the city of David, that Michal the
daughter of Saul looking out at a
window saw king David dancing
and playing: and she despised him
in her heart.
Chapter 16
People offer sacrifices and praise the
Lord—David delivers a psalm of thanksgiving—He praises the Lord—Asaph,
Obed-edom, Zadok, and others minister
before the Lord.
So they brought the a ark of God,
and set it in the midst of the tent
that David had pitched for it: and
they offered burnt sacrifices and
peace offerings before God.
2 And when David had made an
end of offering the burnt offerings
and the peace offerings, he a blessed
the people in the name of the Lord.
3 And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good
piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.
4 ¶ And he appointed certain of
the a Levites to minister before the
ark of the Lord, and to b record,
and to c thank and praise the Lord
God of Israel:
5 Asaph the chief, and next to him
Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth,
and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and

and Jeiel with psalteries and with

with cymbals;

before the ark of the covenant of
God.

36 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the
people said, Amen, and praised
the Lord.
37 ¶ So he left there before the ark
of the covenant of the Lord Asaph
and his brethren, to minister before
the ark continually, as every day’s
work required:
38 And Obed-edom with their
brethren, threescore and eight;
Obed-edom also the son of Jedu­
thun and Hosah to be porters:
39 And Zadok the priest, and his
brethren the priests, before the
tabernacle of the Lord in the a high
place that was at b Gibeon,
40 To a offer burnt offerings unto
the Lord upon the altar of the
burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law
of the Lord, which he commanded
Israel;
41 And with them Heman and
Jeduthun, and the rest that were
chosen, who were expressed by
name, to give a thanks to the Lord,
because his b mercy endureth for ever;
42 And with them Heman and
Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a
sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters.
43 And all the people departed
every man to his house: and David
returned to a bless his house.
Chapter 17
Nathan first approves David’s building of a house of the Lord, then restrains him—David’s son will build
the temple—The triumph of Israel is
foretold—David thanks the Lord for
His goodness to Israel.
Now it came to pass, as David sat
in his house, that David said to
Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in
an house of cedars, but the ark of
	39	a	 1 Kgs. 3:4;

		b	 1 Chr. 21:29.

the covenant of the Lord remaineth
under curtains.
2 Then Nathan said unto David,
Do all that is in thine heart; for
God is with thee.
3 ¶ And it came to pass the same
night, that the word of God came
to Nathan, saying,
4 Go and tell David my servant,
Thus saith the Lord, Thou shalt
not build me an house to dwell in:
5 For I have not dwelt in an house
since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone
from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.
6 Wheresoever I have walked with
all Israel, spake I a word to any of
the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying,
Why have ye not built me an a house
of cedars?
7 Now therefore thus shalt thou say
unto my servant David, Thus saith
the Lord of hosts, I took thee from
the sheepcote, even from following
the sheep, that thou shouldest be
ruler over my people Israel:
8 And I have been with thee
whithersoever thou hast walked,
and have cut off all thine enemies
from before thee, and have made
thee a name like the name of the
great men that are in the earth.
9 Also I will ordain a place for
my people Israel, and will plant
them, and they shall dwell in their
place, and shall be moved no more;
neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at
the beginning,
10 And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue
all thine a enemies. Furthermore I
tell thee that the Lord will build
thee an house.
11 ¶ And it shall come to pass,
when thy days be expired that thou
must go to be with thy fathers, that
I will raise up thy seed after thee,

which shall be of thy sons; and I
will establish his kingdom.
12 He shall build me an house, and
I will stablish his throne for ever.
13 I will be his a father, and he shall
be my son: and I will not take my
mercy away from him, as I took it
from him that was before thee:
14 But I will settle him in mine
a 
house and in my kingdom for ever:
and his throne shall be established
for evermore.
15 According to all these words,
and according to all this vision, so
did Nathan speak unto David.
16 ¶ And David the king came
and sat before the Lord, and said,
Who am I, O Lord God, and what is
mine house, that thou hast brought
me hitherto?
17 And yet this was a small thing
in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast
also spoken of thy servant’s house
for a great while to come, and hast
regarded me according to the estate
of a man of high degree, O Lord God.
18 What can David speak more to
thee for the honour of thy servant?
for thou knowest thy servant.
19 O Lord, for thy servant’s sake,
and according to thine own heart,
hast thou done all this a greatness, in
making known all these great things.
20 O Lord, there is none like thee,
neither is there any God beside thee,
according to all that we have heard
with our ears.
21 And what one nation in the
earth is like thy people Israel,
whom God went to redeem to be his
own people, to make thee a name
of greatness and terribleness, by
driving out nations from before thy
people, whom thou hast redeemed
out of Egypt?
22 For thy people Israel didst thou
make thine own people for ever;
and thou, Lord, becamest their God.
23 Therefore now, Lord, let the
thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning
his house be established for ever,
and do as thou hast said.
	13	a	 Heb. 1:5 (5–6).
	14	a	 Jer. 23:11;

572
24 Let it even be established, that
thy name may be magnified for
ever, saying, The Lord of hosts
is the God of Israel, even a God to
Israel: and let the house of David
thy servant be established before
thee.
25 For thou, O my God, hast told
thy servant that thou wilt build
him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray
before thee.
26 And now, Lord, thou art God,
and hast promised this goodness
unto thy servant:
27 Now therefore let it please thee
to bless the house of thy servant,
that it may be before thee for ever:
for thou blessest, O Lord, and it
shall be blessed for ever.
Chapter 18
David subdues all the adversaries of
Israel and reigns in justice over the
people.
Now after this it came to pass, that
David a smote the Philistines, and
subdued them, and took b Gath and
her towns out of the hand of the
Philistines.
2 And he smote Moab; and the
Moabites became David’s servants,
and brought gifts.
3 ¶ And David smote Hadarezer
king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he
went to stablish his dominion by
the river Euphrates.
4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand
horsemen, and twenty thousand
footmen: David also houghed all
the chariot horses, but reserved of
them an hundred chariots.
5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of
Zobah, David slew of the Syrians
two and twenty thousand men.
6 Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became
David’s servants, and brought gifts.
Thus the Lord preserved David
whithersoever he went.

7 And David took the shields of
gold that were on the servants of
Hadarezer, and brought them to
Jerusalem.
8 Likewise from Tibhath, and from
Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought
David very much brass, wherewith
a 
Solomon made the brasen b sea, and
the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
9 ¶ Now when Tou king of Hamath
heard how David had smitten all the
host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;
10 He sent Hadoram his son to king
David, to inquire of his welfare,
and to congratulate him, because
he had fought against Hadarezer,
and smitten him; (for Hadarezer
had war with Tou;) and with him
all manner of vessels of gold and
silver and brass.
11 ¶ Them also king David dedicated unto the Lord, with the silver
and the gold that he brought from
all these nations; from Edom, and
from Moab, and from the children
of Ammon, and from the Philistines,
and from Amalek.
12 Moreover Abishai the son of
Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the
valley of salt eighteen thousand.
13 ¶ And he put garrisons in Edom;
and all the a Edomites became David’s
servants. Thus the Lord preserved
David whithersoever he went.
14 ¶ So David reigned over all
Israel, and executed judgment and
justice among all his people.
15 And Joab the son of Zeruiah
was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
the son of Ahilud, recorder.
16 And Zadok the son of Ahitub,
and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha
was scribe;
17 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the
Pelethites; and the sons of David
were chief about the king.
Chapter 19
The Ammonites insult David’s messengers and plan war against Israel—
	8	a	 2 Ne. 5:16.
		b	 1 Kgs. 7:23;

David defeats the Ammonites and the
Syrians.
Now it came to pass after this, that
Nahash the king of the children of
a 
Ammon died, and his son reigned
in his stead.
2 And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash,
because his father shewed kindness
to me. And David sent messengers to
comfort him concerning his father.
So the servants of David came into
the land of the children of Ammon
to Hanun, to comfort him.
3 But the princes of the children
of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest
thou that David doth honour thy
father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants
come unto thee for to search, and
to overthrow, and to spy out the
land?
4 Wherefore Hanun took David’s
servants, and shaved them, and
cut off their garments in the midst
hard by their buttocks, and sent
them away.
5 Then there went certain, and told
David how the men were served.
And he sent to meet them: for the
men were greatly ashamed. And the
king said, Tarry at Jericho until your
beards be grown, and then return.
6 ¶ And when the children of
Ammon saw that they had made
themselves odious to David, Hanun
and the children of Ammon sent a
thousand talents of silver to hire
them chariots and horsemen out
of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.
7 So they hired thirty and two
thousand chariots, and the king of
Maachah and his people; who came
and pitched before a Medeba. And
the children of Ammon gathered
themselves together from their
cities, and came to battle.
8 And when David heard of it, he
sent Joab, and all the host of the
mighty men.
9 And the children of Ammon came

2 Chr. 4:15 (12–16).

1 Chronicles 19:10–20:7
out, and put the battle in array
before the gate of the city: and
the kings that were come were by
themselves in the field.
10 Now when Joab saw that the
battle was set against him before
and behind, he chose out of all the
choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.
11 And the rest of the people he
delivered unto the hand of Abishai
his brother, and they set themselves
in array against the children of
Ammon.
12 And he said, If the Syrians be
too strong for me, then thou shalt
help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I
will help thee.
13 Be of good courage, and let us
behave ourselves valiantly for our
people, and for the cities of our
God: and let the Lord do that which
is good in his sight.
14 So Joab and the people that
were with him drew nigh before the
Syrians unto the battle; and they
fled before him.
15 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
they likewise fled before Abishai
his brother, and entered into the
city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
16 ¶ And when the Syrians saw
that they were put to the worse
before Israel, they sent messengers,
and drew forth the Syrians that were
beyond the river: and Shophach the
captain of the host of Hadarezer
went before them.
17 And it was told David; and he
gathered all Israel, and passed over
Jordan, and came upon them, and
set the battle in array against them.
So when David had put the battle
in array against the Syrians, they
fought with him.
18 But the Syrians fled before
Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought
in chariots, and forty thousand
footmen, and killed Shophach the
captain of the host.

19 And when the servants of Hada­
rezer saw that they were put to
the worse before Israel, they made
peace with David, and became his
servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon
any more.
Chapter 20
The Ammonites are overcome—Israel
defeats the Philistines.
And it came to pass, that after the
year was expired, at the time that
kings go out to battle, a Joab led
forth the power of the army, and
wasted the country of the children
of Ammon, and came and besieged
Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and
destroyed it.
2 And David took the crown of
their king from off his head, and
found it to weigh a talent of gold,
and there were precious stones in
it; and it was set upon David’s head:
and he brought also exceeding much
spoil out of the city.
3 And he brought out the people
that were in it, and a cut them with
saws, and with harrows of iron, and
with axes. Even so dealt David with
all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people
returned to Jerusalem.
4 ¶ And it came to pass after this,
that there arose a war at Gezer with
the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai,
that was of the children of the giant:
and they were subdued.
5 And there was war again with
the Philistines; and Elhanan the
son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother
of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear
staff was like a weaver’s beam.
6 And yet again there was war
at Gath, where was a man of great
stature, whose fingers and toes were
four and twenty, six on each hand,
and six on each foot: and he also was
the son of the giant.
7 But when he defied Israel,

Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s
brother slew him.
8 These were born unto the giant
in Gath; and they fell by the hand
of David, and by the hand of his
servants.
Chapter 21
David sins by numbering Israel—The
Lord sends pestilence upon the people—David offers sacrifices and the
plague is stayed.
And a Satan stood up against Israel,
and b provoked David to number
Israel.
2 And David said to Joab and to
the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to
Dan; and bring the number of them
to me, that I may know it.
3 And Joab answered, The Lord
make his people an hundred times
so many more as they be: but, my
lord the king, are they not all my
lord’s servants? why then doth my
lord require this thing? why will
he be a cause of trespass to Israel?
4 Nevertheless the king’s word
prevailed against Joab. Wherefore
Joab departed, and went throughout
all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
5 ¶ And Joab gave the sum of the
number of the people unto David.
And all they of Israel were a a thousand thousand and an hundred
thousand men that drew sword:
and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that
drew sword.
6 But Levi and Benjamin counted
he not among them: for the king’s
word was abominable to Joab.
7 And God was displeased with this
thing; therefore he a smote Israel.
8 And David said unto God, I have
a 
sinned greatly, because I have done
this thing: but now, I beseech thee,
do away the iniquity of thy servant;
for I have done very foolishly.

9 ¶ And the Lord spake unto Gad,
David’s a seer, saying,
10 Go and tell David, saying, Thus
saith the Lord, I offer thee three
things: choose thee one of them, that
I may do it unto thee.
11 So Gad came to David, and said
unto him, Thus saith the Lord,
Choose thee
12 Either a three years’ famine; or
three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword
of thine enemies overtaketh thee;
or else three days the sword of the
Lord, even the pestilence, in the
land, and the angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the coasts
of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again
to him that sent me.
13 And David said unto Gad, I am
in a great strait: let me fall now into
the hand of the Lord; for very great
are his mercies: but let me not fall
into the hand of man.
14 ¶ So the Lord sent pestilence
upon Israel: and there fell of Israel
seventy thousand men.
15 a And God sent an angel unto
Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he
was destroying, the Lord beheld,
and he repented him of the evil,
and said to the angel that destroyed,
It is enough, stay now thine hand.
And the angel of the Lord stood
by the threshingfloor of Ornan the
Jebusite.
16 And David lifted up his eyes,
and saw the angel of the Lord stand
between the earth and the heaven,
having a drawn sword in his hand
stretched out over Jerusalem. Then
David and the elders of Israel, who
were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon
their faces.
17 And David said unto God, Is it
not I that commanded the people to
be numbered? even I it is that have
sinned and done evil indeed; but
as for these sheep, what have they

done? let thine hand, I pray thee,
O Lord my God, be on me, and on
my father’s house; but not on thy
people, that they should be plagued.
18 ¶ Then the a angel of the Lord
commanded Gad to say to David, that
David should go up, and set up an
altar unto the Lord in the b threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
19 And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the
name of the Lord.
20 And Ornan turned back, and
saw the angel; and his four sons
with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
21 And as David came to Ornan,
Ornan looked and saw David, and
went out of the threshingfloor, and
bowed himself to David with his
face to the ground.
22 Then David said to Ornan,
Grant me the place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar
therein unto the Lord: thou shalt
grant it me for the full price: that
the plague may be stayed from the
people.
23 And Ornan said unto David,
Take it to thee, and let my lord the
king do that which is good in his
eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for
burnt offerings, and the threshing
instruments for wood, and the wheat
for the meat offering; I give it all.
24 And king David said to Ornan,
Nay; but I will verily buy it for the
full price: for I will not take that
which is thine for the Lord, nor
offer burnt offerings without cost.
25 So David gave to Ornan for the
place a six hundred shekels of gold
by b weight.
26 And David built there an a altar
unto the Lord, and offered burnt
offerings and peace offerings, and
called upon the Lord; and he answered him from heaven by b fire
upon the altar of burnt offering.

27 And the Lord commanded the
angel; and he put up his sword again
into the sheath thereof.
28 ¶ At that time when David saw
that the Lord had answered him
in the threshingfloor of Ornan the
Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.
29 For the a tabernacle of the Lord,
which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt
offering, were at that season in the
high place at b Gibeon.
30 But David could not go before it
to inquire of God: for he was afraid
because of the sword of the angel
of the Lord.
Chapter 22
David prepares gold, silver, brass, iron,
stone, and cedar wood for the temple—
He charges Solomon to do the work of
building it.
Then David said, This is the a house
of the Lord God, and this is the b altar of the burnt offering for Israel.
2 And David commanded to gather
together the a strangers that were in
the b land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build
the house of God.
3 And David prepared iron in
abundance for the nails for the
doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;
4 Also cedar trees in abundance:
for the Zidonians and they of Tyre
brought much a  cedar wood to
David.
5 And David said, Solomon my
son is a young and tender, and the
house that is to be builded for the
Lord must be exceeding magnifical,
of fame and of glory throughout all
countries: I will therefore now make
preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.
6 ¶ Then he called for Solomon his

son, and charged him to build an
a 
house for the Lord God of Israel.
7 And David said to Solomon, My
son, as for me, it was in my a mind
to build an b house unto the name
of the Lord my God:
8 But the word of the Lord came
to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood
abundantly, and hast made great
wars: thou shalt not build an house
unto my name, because thou hast
shed much blood upon the earth
in my sight.
9 Behold, a son shall be born to thee,
who shall be a man of rest; and I will
give him a rest from all his enemies
round about: for his name shall be
b 
Solomon, and I will give peace and
quietness unto Israel in his days.
10 He shall a build an house for
my name; and he shall be my son,
and I will be his father; and I will
establish the throne of his b kingdom over Israel for ever.
11 Now, my son, the Lord be with
thee; and prosper thou, and build
the house of the Lord thy God, as
he hath said of thee.
12 Only the Lord give thee wisdom and understanding, and give
thee charge concerning Israel, that
thou mayest keep the law of the
Lord thy God.
13 Then shalt thou prosper, if thou
takest heed to fulfil the statutes and
judgments which the Lord charged
Moses with concerning Israel: be
strong, and of good a courage; dread
not, nor be dismayed.
14 Now, behold, in my trouble I
have prepared for the house of the
Lord an hundred thousand a talents
of gold, and a thousand thousand
talents of silver; and of brass and
iron without weight; for it is in
abundance: timber also and stone
have I prepared; and thou mayest
add thereto.

every manner of work.
16 Of the gold, the silver, and the
brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing,
and the Lord be with thee.
17 ¶ David also commanded all
the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,
18 Is not the Lord your God with
you? and hath he not given you rest
on every side? for he hath given the
inhabitants of the land into mine
hand; and the land is subdued before the Lord, and before his people.
19 Now set your heart and your
soul to seek the Lord your God; arise
therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the Lord God, to bring the
a 
ark of the covenant of the Lord,
and the holy vessels of God, into
the house that is to be built to the
name of the Lord.
Chapter 23
Solomon is made king—The Levites are
numbered and assigned their various
religious duties.
So when David was old and full
of days, he made a Solomon his son
king over Israel.
2 ¶ And he gathered together all
the princes of Israel, with the priests
and the Levites.
3 Now the Levites were numbered
from the age of a thirty years and
upward: and their b number by their
polls, man by man, was thirty and
eight thousand.
4 Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work
of the house of the Lord; and six
thousand were officers and a judges:
5 Moreover four thousand were
a 
porters; and four thousand praised
the Lord with the b instruments

which I made, said David, to c praise
therewith.
6 And David divided them into
a 
courses among the sons of Levi,
namely, Gershon, Kohath, and
Merari.
7 ¶ Of the Gershonites were,
Laadan, and Shimei.
8 The sons of Laadan; the chief was
Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
9 The sons of Shimei; Shelomith,
and Haziel, and Haran, three.
These were the chief of the fathers
of Laadan.
10 And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah.
These four were the sons of Shimei.
11 And Jahath was the chief, and
Zizah the second: but Jeush and
Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning,
according to their father’s house.
12 ¶ The sons of Kohath; Amram,
Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
13 The sons of a Amram; Aaron and
Moses: and b Aaron was c separated,
that he should sanctify the most
holy things, he and his sons for ever,
to burn d incense before the Lord,
to minister unto him, and to e bless
in his name for ever.
14 Now concerning a Moses the man
of God, his b sons were named of the
tribe of Levi.
15 The sons of Moses were, a Gershom, and Eliezer.
16 Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.
17 And the sons of Eliezer were,
Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer
had none other sons; but the sons
of Rehabiah were very many.
18 Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith
the chief.
19 Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah
the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the
fourth.

20 Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah
the first, and Jesiah the second.
21 ¶ The sons of a Merari; Mahli,
and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.
22 And Eleazar died, and had no
sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.
23 The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and
Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
24 ¶ These were the sons of a Levi
after the house of their fathers;
even the chief of the fathers, as they
were counted by b number of names
by their c polls, that did the work
for the service of the house of the
Lord, from the age of twenty years
and upward.
25 For David said, The Lord God
of Israel hath given a rest unto his
people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:
26 And also unto the Levites; they
shall no more carry the tabernacle,
nor any vessels of it for the service
thereof.
27 For by the last words of David
the Levites were numbered from
twenty years old and above:
28 Because their a office was to
wait on the sons of Aaron for the
service of the house of the Lord, in
the courts, and in the chambers, and
in the purifying of all holy things,
and the work of the service of the
house of God;
29 Both for the shewbread, and for
the fine flour for meat offering, and
for the unleavened cakes, and for
that which is baked in the pan, and
for that which is fried, and for all
manner of measure and size;
30 And to stand every morning to
a 
thank and praise the Lord, and
likewise at even;

in the new moons, and on the set

continually before the Lord:
32 And that they should keep the
charge of the a tabernacle of the
congregation, and the charge of
the holy place, and the charge of the
sons of b Aaron their brethren, in
the service of the house of the Lord.

Chapter 24
The sons of Aaron and the rest of the
sons of Levi are divided into groups
and assigned their duties by lot.
Now these are the a divisions of the
sons of Aaron. The b sons of Aaron;
Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and
Ithamar.
2 But Nadab and Abihu a died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar
executed the priest’s office.
3 And David distributed them,
both a Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of
Ithamar, according to their offices
in their service.
4 And there were more chief men
found of the sons of Eleazar than
of the sons of Ithamar; and thus
were they divided. Among the sons
of Eleazar there were sixteen chief
men of the house of their fathers,
and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their
fathers.
5 Thus were they divided by a lot,
one sort with another; for the
governors of the sanctuary, and
governors of the house of God, were
of the sons of Eleazar, and of the
sons of Ithamar.
6 And Shemaiah the son of Netha­
neel the scribe, one of the Levites,
wrote them before the king, and the
princes, and Zadok the priest, and
Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and
before the chief of the fathers of the
priests and Levites: one principal

household being taken for Eleazar,
and one taken for Ithamar.
7 Now the first lot came forth to
Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
8 The third to Harim, the fourth
to Seorim,
9 The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth
to Mijamin,
10 The seventh to Hakkoz, the

the twentieth to Jehezekel,

the two and twentieth to Gamul,
18 The three and twentieth to

to Maaziah.
19 These were the orderings of
them in their service to come into
the house of the Lord, according
to their manner, under Aaron their
father, as the Lord God of Israel
had commanded him.
20 ¶ And the rest of the sons of
Levi were these: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael;
Jehdeiah.
21 Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons
of Rehabiah, the first was Isshiah.
22 Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of
the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath.
23 And the sons of a Hebron; Jeriah
the first, Amariah the second, Jaha­

of the sons of Michah; Shamir.

27 ¶ The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur,
and Ibri.
28 Of Mahli came Eleazar, who
had no sons.
29 Concerning Kish: the son of
Kish was Jerahmeel.
30 The sons also of Mushi; Mahli,
and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were
the sons of the Levites after the
house of their fathers.
31 These likewise cast a lots over
against their brethren the sons of
Aaron in the presence of David
the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers
of the priests and Levites, even the
principal fathers over against their
younger brethren.
Chapter 25
The Levite singers and musicians are
assigned their duties by lot.
Moreover David and the captains of the host a separated to the
b 
service of the sons of c Asaph, and
of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who
should prophesy with harps, with
psalteries, and with cymbals: and
the number of the workmen according to their service was:
2 Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur,
and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and
Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under
the hands of Asaph, which prophe­
sied according to the order of the
king.
3 Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah,
six, under the hands of their father
Jeduthun, who prophesied with a
harp, to give thanks and to praise
the Lord.
4 Of Heman: the sons of Heman;
Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah,
Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and

Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth:
5 All these were the sons of Heman
the king’s a seer in the words of God,
to lift up the horn. And God gave
to Heman fourteen sons and three
daughters.
6 All these were under the hands of
their father for a song in the house
of the Lord, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of
the house of God, according to the
king’s order to Asaph, Jeduthun,
and Heman.
7 So the number of them, with
their brethren that were instructed
in the a songs of the Lord, even all
that were b cunning, was two hundred fourscore and eight.
8 ¶ And they cast a  lots, ward
against ward, as well the small as
the great, the teacher as the scholar.
9 Now the first lot came forth
for Asaph to Joseph: the second to
Gedaliah, who with his brethren
and sons were twelve:
10 The third to Zaccur, he, his sons,
and his brethren, were twelve:
11 The fourth to Izri, he, his sons,

The Levites are assigned as porters—
They have charge of the treasures, serve
as officers and judges, and conduct

Israelites.
Concerning the a divisions of the

porters: Of the Korhites was Me­
shelemiah the son of Kore, of the
sons of Asaph.
2 And the sons of Meshelemiah
were, Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third,
Jathniel the fourth,
3 Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the

and Sacar the fourth, and Nethaneel the fifth,
5 Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the
seventh, Peulthai the eighth: for
God a blessed him.
6 Also unto Shemaiah his son were
sons born, that ruled throughout
the house of their father: for they
were mighty men of valour.
7 The sons of Shemaiah; Othni,
and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad,
whose brethren were strong men,
Elihu, and Semachiah.
8 All these of the sons of Obededom: they and their sons and their
brethren, able men for strength for
the service, were threescore and two
of Obed-edom.
9 And Meshelemiah had sons and
brethren, strong men, eighteen.
10 Also Hosah, of the children of
Merari, had sons; Simri the chief,
(for though he was not the firstborn,
yet his father made him the chief;)
11 Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah
the third, Zechariah the fourth:
all the sons and brethren of Hosah
were thirteen.
12 Among these were the divisions
of the porters, even among the chief
men, having wards one against another, to minister in the house of
the Lord.
13 ¶ And they cast a lots, as well the
small as the great, according to the
house of their fathers, for every gate.
14 And the lot eastward fell to
Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his
son, a wise counsellor, they cast lots;
and his lot came out northward.
15 To Obed-edom southward; and
to his sons the house of Asuppim.
16 To Shuppim and Hosah the lot
came forth westward, with the gate
Shallecheth, by the causeway of the
going up, ward against ward.
17 Eastward were six Levites,
northward four a day, southward
four a day, and toward Asuppim
two and two.
18 At Parbar westward, four at the
causeway, and two at Parbar.
19 These are the divisions of the

porters among the sons of Kore, and
among the sons of Merari.
20 ¶ And of the Levites, Ahijah was
over the treasures of the house of
God, and over the treasures of the
dedicated things.
21 As concerning the sons of Laadan;
the sons of the Gershonite Laadan,
chief fathers, even of Laadan the
Gershonite, were Jehieli.
22 The sons of Jehieli; Zetham, and
Joel his brother, which were over the
treasures of the house of the Lord.
23 Of the Amramites, and the
Izharites, the Hebronites, and the
Uzzielites:
24 And Shebuel the son of a Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler
of the treasures.
25 And his brethren by Eliezer;
Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his
son, and Joram his son, and Zichri
his son, and Shelomith his son.
26 Which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures of
the dedicated things, which David
the king, and the chief fathers, the
captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the host,
had dedicated.
27 Out of the spoils won in battles
did they a dedicate to maintain the
house of the Lord.
28 And all that Samuel the a seer,
and Saul the son of Kish, and b Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the
son of Zeruiah, had dedicated; and
whosoever had dedicated any thing,
it was under the hand of Shelomith,
and of his brethren.
29 ¶ Of the Izharites, Chenaniah
and his sons were for the outward
a 
business over Israel, for officers
and judges.
30 And of the Hebronites, Hasha­
biah and his brethren, men of
valour, a thousand and seven hundred, were officers among them of
Israel on this side Jordan westward
in all the business of the Lord, and
in the service of the king.

Jerijah the chief, even among the
Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they
were sought for, and there were
found among them mighty men of
valour at Jazer of Gilead.
32 And his brethren, men of val­
our, were two thousand and seven
hundred chief fathers, whom king
David made rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of
Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the king.

The officers who serve the king are

Now the children of Israel after their

a 
captains of thousands and hundreds, and their officers that served
the king in any matter of the courses,
which came in and went out month

of the year, of every course were
twenty and four thousand.
2 Over the first course for the

3 Of the children of Perez was the

twenty and four thousand.
5 The third captain of the host
for the third month was Benaiah
the son of Jehoiada, a chief priest:
and in his course were twenty and

6 This is that a Benaiah, who was
mighty among the thirty, and above
the thirty: and in his course was

10 The seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite,
of the children of Ephraim: and
in his course were twenty and four

11 The eighth captain for the

Hushathite, of the Zarhites: and
in his course were twenty and four

12 The ninth captain for the ninth
month was Abiezer the Anetothite,

22 Of Dan, Azareel the son of Jeroham. These were the princes of the
tribes of Israel.
23 ¶ But David took not the number of them from twenty years old
and under: because the Lord had
said he would increase Israel like
to the a stars of the heavens.
24 Joab the son of Zeruiah began
to number, but he finished not, because there fell a wrath for it against
Israel; neither was the number put
in the account of the b chronicles of
king David.
25 ¶ And over the king’s a treasures
was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and
over the storehouses in the fields, in
the cities, and in the villages, and
in the castles, was Jehonathan the
son of Uzziah:
26 And over them that did the
work of the field for tillage of the
ground was Ezri the son of Chelub:
27 And over the vineyards was
Shimei the Ramathite: over the increase of the vineyards for the wine

Adlai:
30 Over the camels also was Obil

Chapter 28
David assembles the leaders of Israel—Solomon is appointed to build
the temple—David exhorts Solomon
and the people to keep the commandments—David gives Solomon the pattern
and materials for the temple.
And David assembled all the a princes
of Israel, the princes of the tribes,
and the b captains of the companies
that ministered to the king by course,
and the captains over the thousands,
and captains over the hundreds, and
the stewards over all the c substance
and possession of the king, and of
his sons, with the officers, and with
the mighty men, and with all the
valiant men, unto Jerusalem.
2 Then David the king stood up
upon his feet, and said, Hear me,
my brethren, and my people: As
for me, I had in mine heart to build
an house of a rest for the ark of the
covenant of the Lord, and for the
b 
footstool of our God, and had made
ready for the building:
3 But God said unto me, Thou shalt
not build an house for my name,
because thou hast been a man of
a 
war, and hast shed blood.
4 Howbeit the Lord God of Israel
chose me before all the house of my
father to be king over Israel for ever:
for he hath chosen a Judah to be the
ruler; and of the house of Judah,

to make me b king over all Israel:
5 And of all my sons, (for the Lord
hath given me many sons,) he hath
chosen Solomon my son to sit upon
the throne of the kingdom of the
Lord over Israel.
6 And he said unto me, Solomon
thy son, he shall build my a house
and my courts: for I have chosen him
to be my son, and I will be his father.
7 Moreover I will establish his
kingdom for ever, if he be constant
to do my commandments and my
judgments, as at this day.
8 Now therefore in the sight of
all Israel the congregation of the
Lord, and in the audience of our
God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the Lord your God:
that ye may possess this good a land,
and leave it for an inheritance for
your children after you for ever.
9 ¶ And thou, Solomon my son,
know thou the God of thy father,
and serve him with a a perfect heart
and with a willing mind: for the
Lord b searcheth all hearts, and c understandeth all the imaginations of
the thoughts: if thou d seek him, he
will be found of thee; but if thou
forsake him, he will cast thee off
for ever.
10 Take heed now; for the Lord
hath chosen thee to build an house
for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.
11 ¶ Then David gave to Solomon
his son the pattern of the porch, and
of the houses thereof, and of the
treasuries thereof, and of the upper
chambers thereof, and of the inner
parlours thereof, and of the place
of the mercy seat,
12 And the pattern of all that he

treasuries of the house of God, and
of the treasuries of the dedicated
things:
13 Also for the courses of the
priests and the Levites, and for all
the work of the service of the house
of the Lord, and for all the vessels
of service in the house of the Lord.
14 He gave of gold by weight for
things of gold, for all instruments of
all manner of service; silver also for
all instruments of silver by weight,
for all instruments of every kind
of service:
15 Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their a lamps
of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof:
and for the candlesticks of silver by
weight, both for the candlestick, and
also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick.
16 And by weight he gave gold for
the tables of shewbread, for every
table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:
17 Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups:
and for the golden basins he gave
gold by weight for every basin; and
likewise silver by weight for every
basin of silver:
18 And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for
the pattern of the chariot of the
cherubims, that spread out their
wings, and covered the ark of the
covenant of the Lord.
19 All this, said David, the Lord
made me understand in writing
by his hand upon me, even all the
works of this a pattern.
20 And David said to Solomon his
son, Be strong and of good a courage,
and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed:
for the Lord God, even my God, will
be with thee; he will not fail thee,
nor forsake thee, until thou hast
finished all the work for the service
of the house of the Lord.

be with thee for all the service of the

thee for all manner of workmanship
every willing skilful man, for any
manner of service: also the princes
and all the people will be wholly at
thy commandment.
Chapter 29
All Israel makes a liberal offering for
the temple—David blesses and praises
the Lord and instructs the people—David dies—Solomon reigns as king—The
books of Nathan and Gad are mentioned.
Furthermore David the king said
unto all the congregation, Solomon
my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet a young and tender, and
the work is great: for the palace is
not for man, but for the Lord God.
2 Now I have prepared with all my
might for the house of my God the
gold for things to be made of gold, and
the silver for things of silver, and the
brass for things of brass, the iron for
things of iron, and wood for things
of wood; onyx stones, and stones
to be set, glistering stones, and of
divers colours, and all manner of
precious stones, and marble stones
in abundance.
3 Moreover, because I have set my
affection to the house of my God, I
have of mine own proper good, of
gold and silver, which I have given
to the house of my God, over and
above all that I have prepared for
the holy house,
4 Even three thousand a talents
of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and
seven thousand talents of refined
silver, to overlay the walls of the
houses withal:
5 The gold for things of gold, and
the silver for things of silver, and for
all manner of work to be made by the
hands of artificers. And who then
is willing to consecrate his service
this day unto the Lord?

6 ¶ Then the chief of the fathers
and princes of the tribes of Israel,
and the captains of thousands and
of hundreds, with the rulers of the
king’s work, offered willingly,
7 And gave for the service of the
house of God of gold five thousand
talents and ten thousand drams,
and of silver ten thousand talents,
and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand
talents of iron.
8 And they with whom precious
stones were found gave them to the
treasure of the a house of the Lord,
by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
9 Then the people rejoiced, for that
they offered a willingly, because with
perfect heart they offered b willingly to the Lord: and David the
king also rejoiced with great joy.
10 ¶ Wherefore David blessed the
Lord before all the congregation:
and David said, Blessed be thou,
Lord God of Israel our a father, for
ever and ever.
11 Thine, O Lord, is the greatness,
and the power, and the a glory, and
the victory, and the majesty: for
all that is in the heaven and in the
earth is thine; thine is the b kingdom,
O Lord, and thou art exalted as

thee, and thou reignest over all; and
in thine hand is power and might;
and in thine hand it is to make great,

a 
thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.
14 But who am I, and what is my

offer so willingly after this sort?
for all things a come of thee, and of
thine own have we given thee.

that we have prepared to build thee

of thine hand, and is all thine own.
17 I know also, my God, that thou
a 
triest the heart, and hast pleasure
in uprightness. As for me, in the

willingly offered all these things:
and now have I seen with joy thy
people, which are present here, to

for ever in the imagination of the

blessed the Lord God of their fathers,
and bowed down their heads, and
worshipped the Lord, and the king.
21 And they sacrificed sacrifices

23 Then a Solomon sat on the throne
of the Lord as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and
all Israel obeyed him.
24 And all the princes, and the
mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.
25 And the Lord a magnified Solo­
mon exceedingly in the sight of all
Israel, and bestowed upon him such
royal majesty as had not been on
any king before him in Israel.
26 ¶ Thus David the son of Jesse
reigned over all Israel.
27 And the time that he a reigned
over Israel was forty years; seven

years reigned he in Hebron, and
thirty and three years reigned he
in Jerusalem.
28 And he died in a good old age,
full of days, riches, and honour: and
Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
29 Now the acts of David the king,

come in before this people: for who
can b judge this thy people, that is
so great?
11 And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and
thou hast not asked riches, wealth,
or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long
life; but hast asked wisdom and
knowledge for thyself, that thou
mayest judge my people, over whom
I have made thee king:
12 Wisdom and knowledge is
granted unto thee; and I will give
thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have
had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have
the like.
13 ¶ Then Solomon came from his
journey to the high place that was at
Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before
the tabernacle of the congregation,
and reigned over Israel.
14 And Solomon gathered chariots
and horsemen: and he had a a thousand and four hundred chariots, and
twelve thousand horsemen, which
he placed in the chariot cities, and
with the king at Jerusalem.
15 And the king made silver and
gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as
stones, and cedar trees made he as
the sycomore trees that are in the
vale for abundance.

16 And S olomon had horses
brought out of Egypt, and a linen
yarn: the king’s merchants received
the linen yarn at a price.
17 And they fetched up, and
brought forth out of Egypt a chariot
for six hundred shekels of silver, and
an horse for an hundred and fifty:
and so brought they out horses for
all the kings of the Hittites, and for
the kings of a Syria, by their means.
Chapter 2
Solomon engages Huram of Tyre to
supply timber for the temple—Laborers
are organized to do the work.
And Solomon determined to build
an a house for the name of the Lord,
and an house for his kingdom.
2 And Solomon told out threescore
and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand a to
hew in the mountain, and three
thousand and six hundred to oversee them.
3 ¶ And Solomon sent to a Huram
the king of Tyre, saying, As thou
didst deal with David my father,
and didst send him cedars to build
him an house to dwell therein, even
so deal with me.
4 Behold, I a build an house to
the name of the Lord my God, to
dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for
the continual b shewbread, and for
the burnt offerings morning and
evening, on the sabbaths, and on
the new moons, and on the solemn
feasts of the Lord our God. This is
an ordinance for ever to Israel.
5 And the house which I build is
great: for great is our God above
all gods.
6 But who is able to build him an
house, seeing the heaven and a heaven
of heavens cannot contain him?

7 Send me now therefore a man
cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and
in purple, and crimson, and blue,
and that can skill to grave with the
cunning men that are with me in
Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.
8 Send me also cedar trees, fir
trees, and algum trees, out of Leba­
non: for I know that thy servants
can skill to cut timber in Lebanon;
and, behold, my servants shall be
with thy servants,
9 Even to prepare me timber in
abundance: for the house which I
am about to build shall be wonderful great.
10 And, behold, I will give to thy
servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of
beaten wheat, and twenty thousand
measures of barley, and twenty
thousand baths of wine, and twenty
thousand baths of oil.
11 ¶ Then Huram the king of Tyre
answered in writing, which he sent
to Solomon, Because the Lord hath
loved his people, he hath made thee
king over them.
12 Huram said moreover, Blessed
be the Lord God of Israel, that made
heaven and earth, who hath given
to David the king a wise son, endued with a prudence and understanding, that might build an house
for the Lord, and an house for his
kingdom.
13 And now I have sent a cunning
man, endued with understanding,
of a Huram my father’s,
14 The son of a woman of the
daughters of Dan, and his father
was a man of Tyre, skilful to work
in gold, and in silver, in brass, in
iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and

in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and a to find out
every device which shall be put to
him, with thy cunning men, and
with the cunning men of my lord
David thy father.
15 Now therefore the wheat, and
the barley, the oil, and the wine,
which my lord hath spoken of, let
him send unto his servants:
16 And we will cut wood out of
Lebanon, as much as thou shalt
need: and we will bring it to thee
in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou
shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.
17 ¶ And Solomon numbered all
the a strangers that were in the land
of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered
them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three
thousand and six hundred.
18 And he set threescore and ten
thousand of them to be bearers of
burdens, and fourscore thousand
to be hewers in the mountain, and
three thousand and six hundred
overseers to set the people a work.
Chapter 3
Solomon begins to build the temple—
He makes the veil and the pillars, and
uses much gold and many precious
stones.
Then Solomon began to a build the
house of the Lord at Jerusalem in
mount b Moriah, where the Lord
appeared unto David his father, in
the place that David had prepared
in the c threshingfloor of d Ornan
the Jebusite.
2 And he began to build in the
second day of the second month, in
the fourth year of his reign.

the breadth twenty cubits.
4 And the porch that was in the
front of the house, the length of it
was according to the breadth of the
house, twenty cubits, and the height
was an hundred and twenty: and he
overlaid it within with pure gold.
5 And the greater house he ceiled
with fir tree, which he overlaid with
fine gold, and set thereon palm trees
and chains.
6 And he garnished the house with
precious stones for a beauty: and the
gold was gold of Parvaim.
7 He overlaid also the house, the
beams, the posts, and the walls
thereof, and the doors thereof,
with gold; and graved cherubims
on the walls.
8 And he made the most a holy
house, the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house,
twenty cubits, and the breadth
thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to
six hundred talents.
9 And the weight of the nails
was fifty shekels of gold. And he
overlaid the upper chambers with
gold.
10 And in the most holy house
he made two a cherubims of image
work, and overlaid them with gold.
11 ¶ And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one
wing of the one cherub was five cubits,
reaching to the wall of the house:
and the other wing was likewise five
cubits, reaching to the wing of the
other cherub.
12 And one wing of the other
cherub was five cubits, reaching to
the wall of the house: and the other
wing was five cubits also, joining to
the wing of the other cherub.
13 The wings of these cherubims
spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet,
and their faces were inward.
14 ¶ And he made the veil of blue,
and purple, and crimson, and fine

linen, and wrought cherubims
thereon.
15 Also he made before the house
two pillars of thirty and five cubits
high, and the chapiter that was on
the top of each of them was five
cubits.
16 And he made chains, as in the
a 
oracle, and put them on the heads
of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them
on the chains.
17 And he reared up the pillars
before the temple, one on the right
hand, and the other on the left; and
called the name of that on the right
hand Jachin, and the name of that
on the left Boaz.
Chapter 4
Solomon makes a basin and places it
on twelve oxen—The altar, basins, pots,
and various items are made.
Moreover he made an altar of
a 
brass, twenty cubits the length
thereof, and twenty cubits the
breadth thereof, and ten cubits the
height thereof.
2 ¶ Also he made a molten a sea of
ten cubits from brim to brim, round
in b compass, and five cubits the
height thereof; and a line of thirty
cubits did compass it round about.
3 And under it was the similitude
of oxen, which did compass it round
about: ten in a cubit, compassing the
sea round about. Two rows of oxen
were cast, when it was cast.
4 It stood upon twelve oxen, three
looking toward the north, and
three looking toward the west, and
three looking toward the south,
and three looking toward the east:
and the sea was set above upon
them, and all their hinder parts were
inward.
5 And the thickness of it was an
handbreadth, and the brim of it like
the work of the brim of a cup, with
flowers of lilies; and it received and
held three a thousand baths.

6 ¶ He made also ten a lavers, and
put five on the right hand, and five
on the left, to b wash in them: such
things as they offered for the burnt
offering they c  washed in them;
but the sea was for the priests to
wash in.
7 And he made ten a candlesticks
of gold according to their form,
and set them in the temple, five on
the right hand, and five on the left.
8 He made also ten tables, and
placed them in the temple, five on
the right side, and five on the left.
And he made an hundred basins
of gold.
9 ¶ Furthermore he made the court
of the priests, and the great court,
and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.
10 And he set the a sea on the right
side of the east end, over against
the south.
11 And Huram made the pots, and
the shovels, and the basins. And
Huram finished the work that he
was to make for king Solomon for
the house of God;
12 To wit, the two pillars, and the
pommels, and the chapiters which
were on the top of the two pillars,
and the two wreaths to cover the
two pommels of the chapiters which
were on the top of the pillars;
13 And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows
of pomegranates on each wreath, to
cover the two pommels of the chapi­
ters which were upon the pillars.
14 He made also bases, and a lavers
made he upon the bases;
15 One a sea, and twelve oxen under it.
16 The pots also, and the shovels,
and the fleshhooks, and all their
instruments, did Huram his father
make to king Solomon for the house
of the Lord of a bright brass.
17 In the plain of Jordan did the
king cast them, in the clay ground
between Succoth and Zeredathah.

the golden altar also, and the tables
whereon the shewbread was set;
20 Moreover the candlesticks with
their lamps, that they should burn
after the manner before the oracle,
of pure gold;
21 And the flowers, and the lamps,
and the tongs, made he of gold, and
that perfect gold;
22 And the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers, of pure gold: and the entry of
the house, the inner doors thereof
for the most holy place, and the
doors of the house of the temple,
were of gold.
Chapter 5
The temple is finished, and the ark of
the covenant is placed in the holy of
holies—The glory of the Lord fills the
temple.
Thus all the work that Solomon
made for the house of the Lord was
finished: and Solomon brought in
all the things that David his father
had dedicated; and the silver, and
the gold, and all the instruments,
put he among the treasures of the
house of God.
2 ¶ Then Solomon assembled the
a 
elders of Israel, and all the heads
of the tribes, the chief of the fa­
thers of the children of Israel, unto
Jerusalem, to bring up the b ark of
the covenant of the Lord out of the
city of David, which is Zion.
3 Wherefore all the men of Israel
assembled themselves unto the king
in the feast which was in the seventh month.

and the Levites took up the ark.

and all the holy vessels that were in
the tabernacle, these did the a priests
and the Levites bring up.
6 Also king Solomon, and all the
congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark,
sacrificed sheep and oxen, which
could not be told nor numbered
for multitude.
7 And the priests brought in the
ark of the covenant of the Lord
unto his place, to the a oracle of the
house, into the most holy place, even
under the wings of the cherubims:
8 For the a cherubims spread forth
their b wings over the place of the
ark, and the cherubims covered the
ark and the staves thereof above.
9 And they drew out the staves of
the ark, that the ends of the staves
were seen from the ark before the
oracle; but they were not seen without. And there it is unto this day.
10 There was nothing in the ark
save the two tables which Moses
put therein at Horeb, when the Lord
made a covenant with the children
of Israel, when they came out of
Egypt.
11 ¶ And it came to pass, when
the priests were come out of the
holy place: (for all the priests that
were present were sanctified, and
did not then wait by course:
12 Also the Levites which were the
singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons
and their brethren, being arrayed
in white a linen, having cymbals
and b psalteries and harps, stood at
the east end of the altar, and with
them an hundred and twenty priests
sounding with trumpets:)
13 It came even to pass, as the
trumpeters and singers were as one,
to make one sound to be heard in
praising and a thanking the Lord;

the Lord, saying, For he is good; for
his mercy endureth for ever: that then
the house was filled with a cloud,
even the house of the Lord;
14 So that the priests could not
stand to minister by reason of the
a 
cloud: for the b glory of the Lord
had filled the house of God.
Chapter 6
Solomon blesses the congregation of Israel—He offers the dedicatory prayer
for the temple—He prays for mercy and
blessings for penitent Israel.
Then said a  Solomon, The Lord
hath said that he would dwell in
the thick darkness.
2 But I have built an house of habi­
tation for thee, and a place for thy
dwelling for ever.
3 And the king turned his face, and
blessed the whole congregation of
Israel: and all the congregation
of Israel stood.
4 And he said, Blessed be the Lord
God of Israel, who hath with his
hands fulfilled that which he spake
with his mouth to my father David,
saying,
5 Since the day that I brought forth
my people out of the land of Egypt
I chose no city among all the tribes
of Israel to build an house in, that
my name might be there; neither
chose I any man to be a ruler over
my people Israel:
6 But I have chosen a Jerusalem,
that my name might be there; and
have chosen David to be over my
people Israel.
7 Now it was in the heart of David
my father to build an house for the
name of the Lord God of Israel.
8 But the Lord said to David my
father, Forasmuch as it was in thine
heart to build an house for my name,

thou didst well in that it was in
thine heart:
9 Notwithstanding thou shalt not
build the house; but thy son which
shall come forth out of thy loins, he
shall build the house for my name.
10 The Lord therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for I am risen up in the room of
David my father, and am set on the
throne of Israel, as the Lord promised, and have built the house for
the name of the Lord God of Israel.
11 And in it have I put the ark,
wherein is the covenant of the
Lord, that he made with the children of Israel.
12 ¶ And he stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of
all the congregation of Israel, and
spread forth his hands:
13 For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold, of five cubits long,
and five cubits broad, and three
cubits high, and had set it in the
midst of the court: and upon it he
stood, and kneeled down upon his
knees before all the congregation of
Israel, and spread forth his hands
toward heaven,
14 And said, O a Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee in
the heaven, nor in the earth; which
keepest covenant, and shewest mercy
unto thy servants, that b walk before
thee with all their hearts:
15 Thou which hast kept with thy
servant David my father that which
thou hast promised him; and spakest
with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled
it with thine hand, as it is this day.
16 Now therefore, O Lord God of
Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast
promised him, saying, There shall
not fail thee a man in my sight to
sit upon the throne of Israel; a yet so
that thy children take heed to their
way to walk in my law, as thou hast
walked before me.
17 Now then, O Lord God of Israel,
let thy word be verified, which thou
hast spoken unto thy servant David.

18 But will God in very deed dwell

19 Have respect therefore to the
prayer of thy servant, and to his
supplication, O Lord my God, to
hearken unto the cry and the prayer
which thy servant prayeth before
thee:
20 That thine eyes may be open
upon this house day and night, upon
the place whereof thou hast said
that thou wouldest put thy name
there; to hearken unto the prayer
which thy servant prayeth toward
this place.
21 Hearken therefore unto the
supplications of thy servant, and of
thy people Israel, which they shall
make toward this place: hear thou
from thy dwelling place, even from

22 ¶ If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon
him to make him swear, and the
oath come before thine altar in

23 Then hear thou from heaven,

and promises to bless the people—The
Israelites will prosper if they keep the
commandments.
Now when Solomon had made an
end of a praying, the b fire came down
from heaven, and consumed the
burnt offering and the sacrifices;
and the glory of the Lord filled
the house.
2 And the priests could not enter
into the house of the Lord, because
the a glory of the Lord had filled
the Lord’s house.
3 And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down,
and the glory of the Lord upon the
house, they bowed themselves with
their faces to the ground upon the
pavement, and a worshipped, and
praised the Lord, saying, For he is
good; for his mercy endureth for ever.
4 ¶ Then the king and all the
people a offered sacrifices before
the Lord.
5 And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand
oxen, and an hundred and twenty
thousand sheep: so the king and
all the people a dedicated the house
of God.
6 And the priests waited on their
offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the Lord, which
David the king had made to praise
the Lord, because his mercy endureth for ever, when David praised
by their ministry; and the priests
sounded trumpets before them, and
all Israel stood.
7 Moreover Solomon hallowed the
middle of the court that was before
the house of the Lord: for there he
offered burnt offerings, and the
fat of the peace offerings, because
the brasen altar which Solomon
had made was not able to receive

the burnt offerings, and the meat

8 ¶ Also at the same time Solomon
kept the a feast seven days, and all
Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of
Hamath unto the b river of Egypt.
9 And in the a eighth day they made
a b solemn assembly: for they kept
the dedication of the altar seven
days, and the feast seven days.
10 And on the three and twentieth
day of the seventh month he sent the
people away into their tents, glad and
merry in heart for the goodness that
the Lord had shewed unto David, and
to Solomon, and to Israel his people.
11 Thus Solomon a finished the
house of the Lord, and the king’s
house: and all that came into Solo­
mon’s heart to make in the house
of the Lord, and in his own house,
he prosperously effected.
12 ¶ And the Lord appeared to
Solomon by night, and said unto
him, I have heard thy prayer, and
have chosen this a place to myself
for an house of sacrifice.
13 a If I shut up heaven that there
be no rain, or if I command the
locusts to devour the land, or if I
send pestilence among my people;
14 If my people, which are called
by my name, shall a humble themselves, and b pray, and seek my c face,
and turn from their wicked ways;
then will I hear from heaven, and
will forgive their sin, and will heal
their land.
15 Now mine eyes shall be open,
and mine ears attent unto the prayer
that is made in this place.
16 For now have I a chosen and
b 
sanctified this house, that my
name may be there for ever: and
mine eyes and mine heart shall be
there perpetually.

17 And as for thee, if thou wilt
walk before me, as David thy father
walked, and do according to all
that I have commanded thee, and
shalt observe my statutes and my
judgments;
18 Then will I stablish the throne
of thy kingdom, according as I have
covenanted with David thy father,
saying, There shall not fail thee a
man to be ruler in Israel.
19 But if ye turn away, and forsake
my statutes and my commandments,
which I have set before you, and
shall go and serve other gods, and
worship them;
20 Then will I pluck them up by
the a roots out of my land which I
have given them; and this house,
which I have sanctified for my
name, will I cast out of my sight,
and will make it to be a proverb and
a byword among all nations.
21 And this house, which is high,
shall be an astonishment to every
one that passeth by it; so that he shall
say, Why hath the Lord done thus
unto this land, and unto this house?
22 And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the Lord God of
their fathers, which brought them
forth out of the land of Egypt, and
laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them:

3 And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.
4 And he built Tadmor in the
wilderness, and all the store cities,
which he built in Hamath.
5 Also he built Beth-horon the
upper, and Beth-horon the a nether,
b 
fenced cities, with walls, gates,
and bars;
6 And Baalath, and all the store
cities that Solomon had, and all
the chariot cities, and the cities of
the horsemen, and all that Solomon
desired to build in Jerusalem, and
in Lebanon, and throughout all the
land of his dominion.
7 ¶ As for all the people that were
left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the
Hivites, and the Jebusites, which
were not of Israel,
8 But of their children, who were
left after them in the land, whom
the children of Israel consumed not,
them did Solomon make to a pay
tribute until this day.
9 But of the children of Israel did
Solomon make no servants for his
work; but they were men of war, and
chief of his captains, and captains
of his chariots and horsemen.
10 And these were the chief of
king Solomon’s officers, even two
hundred and fifty, that bare rule
over the people.
11 ¶ And Solomon brought up the
daughter of Pharaoh out of the city
of David unto the house that he
had built for her: for he said, a My
wife shall not dwell in the house
of David king of Israel, because the
places are holy, whereunto the ark
of the Lord hath come.
12 ¶ Then Solomon offered burnt
offerings unto the Lord on the altar of the Lord, which he had built
before the porch,

day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on

year, even in the feast of unleavened
bread, and in the feast of weeks, and
in the feast of tabernacles.
14 ¶ And he appointed, according to the a  order of David his
father, the b courses of the priests
to their service, and the Levites to
their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the c duty
of every day required: the porters
also by their courses at every gate:
for so had David the man of God
commanded.
15 And they departed not from the
commandment of the king unto the
priests and Levites concerning any
matter, or concerning the treasures.
16 Now all the work of Solomon
was prepared a unto the day of the
foundation of the house of the Lord,
and until it was finished. So the
house of the Lord was b perfected.
17 ¶ Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side
in the land of Edom.
18 And Huram sent him by the
hands of his servants ships, and
servants that had knowledge of
the sea; and they went with the
servants of Solomon to Ophir, and
took thence four hundred and fifty
talents of gold, and brought them
to king Solomon.
Chapter 9
The queen of Sheba visits Solomon—He
excels in wisdom, wealth, and magnificence—After reigning forty years, Solomon dies, and Rehoboam becomes king.
And when the queen of Sheba heard
of the fame of Solomon, she came to
prove Solomon with hard questions
at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices,
and gold in abundance, and precious
stones: and when she was come to
Solomon, she communed with him
of all that was in her heart.
2 And Solomon told her all her
questions: and there was nothing

hid from Solomon which he told
her not.
3 And when the queen of Sheba
had seen the wisdom of Solomon,
and the house that he had built,
4 And the meat of his table, and
the sitting of his servants, and the
attendance of his ministers, and
their apparel; his cupbearers also,
and their apparel; and his ascent by
which he went up into the house
of the Lord; there was no more
spirit in her.
5 And she said to the king, It was
a true report which I heard in mine
own land of thine a acts, and of thy
wisdom:
6 Howbeit I believed not their
words, until I came, and mine eyes
had seen it: and, behold, the one
half of the greatness of thy wisdom
was not told me: for thou exceedest
the fame that I heard.
7 Happy are thy men, and happy
are these thy servants, which stand
continually before thee, and hear
thy wisdom.
8 Blessed be the Lord thy God,
which delighted in thee to set thee
on his throne, to be king for the Lord
thy God: because thy God loved
Israel, to establish them for ever,
therefore made he thee king over
them, to do judgment and justice.
9 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold,
and of spices great abundance, and
precious stones: neither was there
any such spice as the queen of Sheba
gave king Solomon.
10 And the servants also of Huram,
and the servants of Solomon, which
brought gold from Ophir, brought
algum trees and precious stones.
11 And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of
the Lord, and to the king’s palace,
and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen
before in the land of Judah.

whatsoever she asked, beside that
which she had brought unto the
king. So she turned, and went
away to her own land, she and her
servants.
13 ¶ Now the weight of gold that
came to Solomon in one year was
six hundred and threescore and six
talents of gold;
14 Beside that which a chapmen
and merchants brought. And all
the kings of Arabia and governors
of the country brought gold and
silver to Solomon.
15 ¶ And king Solomon made two
hundred a targets of beaten gold: six
hundred shekels of beaten gold went
to one target.
16 And three hundred shields made
he of beaten gold: three hundred
shekels of gold went to one shield.
And the king put them in the house
of the forest of Lebanon.
17 Moreover the king made a great
throne of ivory, and overlaid it with
pure gold.
18 And there were six steps to the
throne, with a footstool of gold,
which were fastened to the throne,
and a stays on each side of the sitting place, and two lions standing
by the stays:
19 And twelve lions stood there on
the one side and on the other upon
the six steps. There was not the like
made in any kingdom.
20 ¶ And all the drinking vessels
of king Solomon were of gold, and
all the vessels of the house of the
forest of Lebanon were of pure gold:
none were of silver; it was not any
thing accounted of in the days of
Solomon.
21 For the king’s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram:
every three years once came the
ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and
silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

sought the presence of Solomon, to
hear his wisdom, that God had put
in his heart.
24 And they brought every man
his present, vessels of silver, and
vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules,
a rate year by year.
25 ¶ And Solomon had four thousand stalls for a horses and chariots,
and twelve thousand horsemen;
whom he bestowed in the chariot
cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
26 ¶ And he a reigned over all the
kings from b the river even unto
the land of the Philistines, and to
the border of Egypt.
27 And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees
made he as the sycomore trees that
are in the low plains in abundance.
28 And they brought unto Solomon a horses out of Egypt, and out
of all lands.
29 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of
Solomon, first and last, are they
not written in the book of a Nathan
the prophet, and in the prophecy
of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the
visions of Iddo the b seer against
Jeroboam the son of Nebat?

fathers, and he was buried in the

And a Rehoboam went to Shechem:
for to Shechem were all Israel come

Egypt, whither he had fled from the

presence of Solomon the king,
heard it, that Jeroboam returned
out of Egypt.
3 And they sent and called him. So
Jeroboam and all Israel came and
spake to Rehoboam, saying,
4 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy
father, and his heavy yoke that
he put upon us, and we will serve
thee.
5 And he said unto them, Come
again unto me after three days.
And the people departed.
6 ¶ And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood
before Solomon his father while
he yet lived, saying, What counsel
give ye me to return answer to this
people?
7 And they spake unto him, saying,
If thou be kind to this people, and
please them, and speak good words
to them, they will be thy servants
for ever.
8 But he forsook the counsel which
the old men gave him, and took
counsel with the young men that
were brought up with him, that
stood before him.
9 And he said unto them, What
advice give ye that we may return
answer to this people, which have
spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did
put upon us?
10 And the young men that were
brought up with him spake unto
him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer
the people that spake unto thee,
saying, Thy father made our yoke
heavy, but make thou it somewhat
lighter for us; thus shalt thou say
unto them, My little finger shall be
thicker than my father’s loins.
11 For whereas my father put a
heavy yoke upon you, I will put
more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will
chastise you with scorpions.
12 So Jeroboam and all the people
came to Rehoboam on the third day,
11	1	a	 1 Kgs. 12:21 (21–33).

2 Chronicles 10:3–11:1
as the king bade, saying, Come again
to me on the third day.
13 And the king answered them
roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,
14 And answered them after the
advice of the young men, saying,
My father made your yoke heavy,
but I will add thereto: my father
chastised you with whips, but I will
chastise you with scorpions.
15 So the king hearkened not unto
the people: for the cause was of God,
that the Lord might perform his
word, which he spake by the hand
of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam
the son of Nebat.
16 ¶ And when all Israel saw that
the king would not hearken unto
them, the people answered the king,
saying, What portion have we in David? and we have none inheritance
in the son of Jesse: every man to
your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to thine own house. So all
Israel went to their tents.
17 But as for the children of Israel
that dwelt in the cities of Judah,
Rehoboam reigned over them.
18 Then king Rehoboam sent
Hadoram that was over the tribute;
and the children of Israel stoned
him with stones, that he died. But
king Rehoboam made speed to get
him up to his chariot, to flee to
Jerusalem.
19 And Israel rebelled against the
house of David unto this day.
Chapter 11
Rehoboam strengthens the kingdom
of Judah but is forbidden to subdue
Israel—Jeroboam leads the kingdom
of Israel into idolatry—Rehoboam takes
many wives and concubines.
And when a Rehoboam was come to
Jerusalem, he gathered of the house
of Judah and Benjamin an hundred
and fourscore thousand chosen
men, which were warriors, to fight
against Israel, that he might bring
the kingdom again to Rehoboam.

2 Chronicles 11:2–12:1

600

2 But the word of the Lord came
to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
3 Speak unto Rehoboam the son
of Solomon, king of Judah, and to
all Israel in Judah and Benjamin,
saying,
4 Thus saith the Lord, Ye shall
not go up, nor fight against your
brethren: return every man to his
house: for this thing is done of me.
And they obeyed the words of the
Lord, and returned from going
against Jeroboam.
5 ¶ And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for a defence
in Judah.
6 He built even Beth-lehem, and
Etam, and Tekoa,
7 And Beth-zur, and Shoco, and
Adullam,
8 And Gath, and Mareshah, and
Ziph,
9 And Adoraim, and Lachish, and
Azekah,
10 And Zorah, and Aijalon, and
Hebron, which are in Judah and in
Benjamin fenced cities.
11 And he fortified the strong
holds, and put captains in them, and
store of victual, and of oil and wine.
12 And in every several city he put
shields and spears, and made them
exceeding strong, having Judah and
Benjamin on his side.
13 ¶ And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel a resorted
to him out of all their b coasts.
14 For the Levites left their a suburbs and their b possession, and
came to Judah and Jerusalem: for
Jeroboam and his sons had c cast
them off from executing the priest’s
office unto the Lord:
15 And he ordained him a priests
for the high places, and for the
b 
devils, and for the calves which he
had made.
16 And after them out of all the
tribes of Israel such as set their

hearts to seek the Lord God of
Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the Lord God of their
fathers.
17 So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam
the son of Solomon strong, three
years: for three years they walked
in the way of David and Solomon.
18 ¶ And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the
son of David to wife, and Abihail the
daughter of a Eliab the son of Jesse;
19 Which bare him children; Jeush,
and Shamariah, and Zaham.
20 And after her he took a Maachah
the daughter of Absalom; which
bare him Abijah, and Attai, and
Ziza, and Shelomith.
21 And Rehoboam loved Maachah
the daughter of Absalom above
all his wives and his concubines:
(for he took eighteen wives, and
threescore concubines; and begat
twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)
22 And Rehoboam made Abijah
the son of Maachah the chief, to be
ruler among his brethren: for he
thought to make him king.
23 And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his a children throughout all the countries of Judah and
Benjamin, unto every fenced city:
and he gave them victual in abundance. And he b desired many wives.
Chapter 12
Rehoboam forsakes the law of the
Lord—The Egyptians plunder Jerusalem
and take the treasures of the house of
the Lord—The people repent and receive
partial deliverance—Rehoboam dies.
And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom,
and had strengthened himself, he
forsook the law of the Lord, and
all Israel with him.

2 And it came to pass, that in the
fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak
king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the Lord,
3 With twelve hundred chariots,
and threescore thousand horsemen:
and the people were without number
that came with him out of Egypt;
the a Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the
b 
Ethiopians.
4 And he took the a fenced cities
which pertained to Judah, and came
to Jerusalem.
5 ¶ Then came Shemaiah the
prophet to Rehoboam, and to the
princes of Judah, that were gathered
together to Jerusalem because of
Shishak, and said unto them, Thus
saith the Lord, Ye have forsaken
me, and therefore have I also left
you in the hand of Shishak.
6 Whereupon the princes of Israel
and the king humbled themselves;
and they said, The Lord is righteous.
7 And when the Lord saw that
they humbled themselves, the word
of the Lord came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves;
therefore I will not destroy them, but
I will grant them some deliverance;
and my wrath shall not be poured
out upon Jerusalem by the hand
of Shishak.
8 Nevertheless they shall be his
servants; that they may know my
service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
9 So Shishak king of Egypt came
up against Jerusalem, and took
away the treasures of the house of
the Lord, and the treasures of the
king’s house; he took all: he carried
away also the shields of gold which
Solomon had made.
10 Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and
committed them to the hands of the
chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king’s house.
11 And when the king entered into

the house of the Lord, the guard
came and fetched them, and brought
them again into the guard chamber.
12 And when he humbled himself,
the wrath of the Lord turned from
him, that he would not destroy him
altogether: and also in Judah things
went well.
13 ¶ So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and
reigned: for Rehoboam was one
and forty years old when he began
to reign, and he reigned seventeen
years in a Jerusalem, the city which
the Lord had chosen out of all the
tribes of Israel, to put his name
there. And his mother’s name was
Naamah an Ammonitess.
14 And he did evil, because he
prepared not his heart to seek the
Lord.
15 Now the acts of Rehoboam, first
and last, are they not written in the
book of a Shemaiah the prophet,
and of Iddo the b seer concerning
genealogies? And there were wars
between Rehoboam and Jeroboam
continually.
16 And Rehoboam slept with his
fathers, and was buried in the city of
David: and a Abijah his son reigned
in his stead.
Chapter 13
Abijah reigns in Judah—He defeats
Jeroboam and the armies of Israel—
The Lord strikes Jeroboam, and he dies.
Now in the eighteenth year of king
Jeroboam began Abijah to reign

2 He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was
Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of
Gibeah. And there was war between
Abijah and Jeroboam.
3 And Abijah set the battle in array
with an army of valiant men of war,
even four hundred thousand chosen
men: Jeroboam also set the battle
in array against him with eight

hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour.
4 ¶ And Abijah stood up upon
mount Zemaraim, which is in mount
Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou
Jeroboam, and all Israel;
5 Ought ye not to know that the
Lord God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever,
even to him and to his sons by a
a 
covenant of b salt?
6 Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
the servant of Solomon the son of
David, is risen up, and hath rebelled
against his lord.
7 And there are gathered unto him
vain men, the a children of Belial,
and have strengthened themselves
against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young
and tenderhearted, and could not
withstand them.
8 And now ye think to withstand
the kingdom of the Lord in the
hand of the sons of David; and ye
be a great multitude, and there are
with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.
9 Have ye not a cast out the priests
of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, and
the Levites, and have made you
priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself
with a young b bullock and seven
rams, the same may be a priest of
them that are no gods.
10 But as for us, the Lord is our
God, and we have not forsaken him;
and the priests, which minister unto
the Lord, are the sons of Aaron, and
the Levites wait upon their business:
11 And they burn unto the Lord
every morning and every evening
burnt sacrifices and sweet incense:
the shewbread also set they in order
upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof,
to burn every evening: for we keep
the charge of the Lord our God; but
ye have forsaken him.

12 And, behold, God himself is
with us for our captain, and his

cry alarm against you. O children
of Israel, fight ye not against the
Lord God of your fathers; for ye
shall not prosper.
13 ¶ But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind
them: so they were before Judah,
and the ambushment was behind
them.
14 And when Judah looked back,
behold, the battle was before and
behind: and they cried unto the
Lord, and the priests sounded with
the trumpets.
15 Then the men of Judah gave
a shout: and as the men of Judah
shouted, it came to pass, that God
smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
16 And the children of Israel fled
before Judah: and God delivered
them into their hand.
17 And Abijah and his people slew
them with a great slaughter: so there
fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
18 Thus the children of Israel were
brought under at that time, and the
children of Judah prevailed, because
they a relied upon the Lord God of
their fathers.
19 And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him,
Beth-el with the towns thereof, and
Jeshanah with the towns thereof,
and Ephrain with the towns thereof.
20 Neither did Jeroboam recover
strength again in the days of Abijah:
and the Lord a struck him, and he
died.
21 ¶ But Abijah waxed mighty,
and married fourteen wives, and
begat twenty and two sons, and
sixteen daughters.

Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the story of the
prophet a Iddo.

Chapter 14

Asa reigns in Judah, rebuilds the cities,
and defeats and plunders the Ethiopians, who attack Judah.
So Abijah slept with his fathers,
and they buried him in the city of
David: and Asa his son reigned in
his stead. In his days the land was
quiet ten years.
2 And a Asa did that which was good
and right in the eyes of the Lord
his God:
3 For he took away the altars of the
strange gods, and the high places,
and brake down the images, and
cut down the a groves:
4 And commanded Judah to seek
the Lord God of their fathers, and to
do the law and the commandment.
5 Also he took away out of all the
cities of Judah the high places and
the images: and the kingdom was
quiet before him.
6 ¶ And he built fenced cities in
Judah: for the land had rest, and he
had no war in those years; because
the Lord had given him rest.
7 Therefore he said unto Judah,
Let us build these cities, and make
about them walls, and towers, gates,
and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the
Lord our God, we have sought him,
and he hath given us rest on every
side. So they built and prospered.
8 And Asa had an army of men that
bare a targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and
out of Benjamin, that bare shields
and drew bows, two hundred and
fourscore thousand: all these were
mighty men of valour.
9 ¶ And there came out against
them Zerah the Ethiopian with an
host of a thousand thousand, and
three hundred chariots; and came
unto Mareshah.
10 Then Asa went out against
him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at
Mareshah.

many, or with them that have no

we rest on thee, and in thy name we
go against this multitude. O Lord,
thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.
12 So the Lord smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah;
and the Ethiopians fled.
13 And Asa and the people that
were with him pursued them unto
Gerar: and the Ethiopians were
overthrown, that they could not
recover themselves; for they were
destroyed before the Lord, and before his host; and they carried away
very much spoil.
14 And they smote all the cities
round about Gerar; for the fear of
the Lord came upon them: and they
spoiled all the cities; for there was
exceeding much spoil in them.
15 They smote also the tents of
cattle, and carried away sheep and
camels in abundance, and returned
to Jerusalem.

Azariah prophesies that Judah will

Manasseh, and Simeon migrate to
Judah—The people covenant to serve

And the Spirit of God came upon
Azariah the son of Oded:
2 And he went out to meet Asa,
and said unto him, Hear ye me,
Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin;
The Lord is with you, while ye be
with him; and if ye seek him, he will
be found of you; but if ye forsake
him, he will forsake you.

4 But when they in their a trouble did turn unto the Lord God
of Israel, and b sought him, he was
found of them.
5 And in those times there was no
peace to him that went out, nor to
him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants
of the countries.
6 And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did
vex them with all adversity.
7 Be ye strong therefore, and let
not your hands be weak: for your
a 
work shall be rewarded.
8 And when Asa heard these words,
and the prophecy of Oded the
prophet, he took courage, and put
away the abominable idols out of
all the land of Judah and Benjamin,
and out of the cities which he had
taken from mount Ephraim, and
renewed the altar of the Lord, that
was before the porch of the Lord.
9 And he gathered all Judah and
Benjamin, and the a strangers with
them out of Ephraim and Manasseh,
and out of Simeon: for they fell to
him out of Israel in abundance,
when they saw that the Lord his
God was with him.
10 So they gathered themselves
together at Jerusalem in the third
month, in the fifteenth year of the
reign of Asa.
11 And they offered unto the Lord
the same time, of the spoil which
they had brought, seven hundred
oxen and seven thousand sheep.
12 And they entered into a a covenant to seek the Lord God of their
fathers with all their heart and with
all their soul;
13 That whosoever would not seek
the Lord God of Israel should be
put to death, whether small or great,
whether man or woman.
14 And they sware unto the Lord
with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with

oath: for they had sworn with all
their heart, and sought him with
their whole desire; and he was

found of them: and the Lord gave
them rest round about.
16 ¶ And also concerning Maachah the a mother of Asa the king,
he removed her from being queen,
because she had made an idol in a
grove: and Asa cut down her idol,
and stamped it, and burnt it at the
brook Kidron.
17 But the high places were not
taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect
all his days.
18 ¶ And he brought into the
house of God the things that his
father had dedicated, and that he
himself had dedicated, silver, and
gold, and vessels.
19 And there was no more war
unto the five and thirtieth year of
the reign of Asa.

In the six and thirtieth year of the

Ramah, to the intent that he might
let none go out or come in to Asa
king of Judah.
2 Then Asa brought out silver
and gold out of the treasures of the
house of the Lord and of the king’s
house, and sent to Ben-hadad king
of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus,
saying,
3 There is a league between me and
thee, as there was between my father
and thy father: behold, I have sent
thee silver and gold; go, break thy
league with Baasha king of Israel,
that he may depart from me.

king Asa, and sent the captains
of his armies against the cities of
Israel; and they smote Ijon, and

5 And it came to pass, when Baasha
heard it, that he left off building
of Ramah, and let his work cease.
6 Then Asa the king took all Judah;
and they carried away the stones
of Ramah, and the timber thereof,
wherewith Baasha was building; and
he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.
7 ¶ And at that time Hanani the
a 
seer came to Asa king of Judah, and
said unto him, Because thou hast
relied on the b king of Syria, and
not c relied on the Lord thy God,
therefore is the host of the king of
d 
Syria escaped out of thine hand.
8 Were not the Ethiopians and
the Lubims a huge host, with very
many chariots and horsemen? yet,
because thou didst rely on the Lord,
he delivered them into thine hand.
9 For the eyes of the Lord run to
and fro throughout the whole earth,
to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect
toward him. Herein thou hast done
foolishly: therefore from henceforth
thou shalt have wars.
10 Then Asa was wroth with the
seer, and put him in a a prison house;
for he was in a rage with him because
of this thing. And Asa oppressed
some of the people the same time.
11 ¶ And, behold, the acts of Asa,
first and last, lo, they are written
in the book of the kings of Judah
and Israel.
12 And Asa in the thirty and ninth
year of his reign was diseased in his
feet, until his disease was exceeding
great: yet in his disease he sought not
to the Lord, but to the physicians.
13 ¶ And Asa slept with his fathers,
and died in the one and fortieth
year of his reign.

himself in the city of David, and

Chapter 17
Jehoshaphat reigns well and prospers in
Judah—Priests travel and teach out of
the book of the law of the Lord.
And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in
his stead, and strengthened himself
against Israel.
2 And he placed forces in all the
fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in
the cities of Ephraim, which Asa
his father had taken.
3 And the Lord was with Jehosh­
aphat, because he walked in the
first ways of his father David, and
sought not unto Baalim;
4 But sought to the Lord God of
his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.
5 Therefore the Lord stablished
the kingdom in his hand; and all
Judah brought to Jehoshaphat
presents; and he had riches and
honour in abundance.
6 And his heart was lifted up in
the ways of the Lord: moreover
he took away the high places and
groves out of Judah.
7 ¶ Also in the third year of his reign
he sent to his princes, even to Ben-hail,
and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah,
and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah,
to teach in the cities of Judah.
8 And with them he sent Levites,
even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and
Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah,

and Jehoram, priests.

so that they made no war against

11 Also some of the Philistines
brought Jehoshaphat presents, and
tribute silver; and the Arabians
brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and
seven thousand and seven hundred
he goats.
12 ¶ And Jehoshaphat waxed great
exceedingly; and he built in Judah
a 
castles, and cities of store.
13 And he had much business in
the cities of Judah: and the men of
war, mighty men of valour, were in
Jerusalem.
14 And these are the numbers of
them according to the house of their
fathers: Of Judah, the captains of
thousands; Adnah the chief, and
with him mighty men of valour
three hundred thousand.
15 And next to him was Jehohanan

him two hundred thousand mighty

armed men with bow and shield

Now Jehoshaphat had riches and

2 And after certain years he went
down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab
killed sheep and oxen for him in
abundance, and for the people that
he had with him, and persuaded him
to go up with him to Ramoth-gilead.
3 And Ahab king of Israel said unto
Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt
thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead?
And he answered him, I am as thou
art, and my people as thy people;
and we will be with thee in the war.
4 ¶ And Jehoshaphat said unto the
king of Israel, a Inquire, I pray thee,
at the word of the Lord to day.
5 Therefore the king of Israel
gathered together of prophets four
hundred men, and said unto them,
Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to
battle, or shall I forbear? And they
said, Go up; for God will deliver it
into the king’s hand.
6 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not
here a prophet of the Lord besides,
that we might inquire of him?
7 And the king of Israel said unto
Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man,
by whom we may a inquire of the
Lord: but I hate him; for he never
prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the
son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said,
Let not the king say so.
8 And the king of Israel called for
one of his officers, and said, Fetch
quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.
9 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either
of them on his throne, clothed in
their robes, and they sat in a void
place at the entering in of the gate
of Samaria; and all the prophets
prophesied before them.
10 And Zedekiah the son of Chena­
anah had made him a horns of iron,
and said, Thus saith the Lord, With
these thou shalt push Syria until
they be consumed.

so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead,
and prosper: for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king.
12 And the messenger that went to
call Micaiah spake to him, saying,
Behold, the words of the prophets
declare good to the king with one
assent; let thy word therefore, I
pray thee, be like one of theirs, and
speak thou good.
13 And Micaiah said, As the Lord
liveth, even what my God saith, that
will I speak.
14 And when he was come to the
king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead
to battle, or shall I forbear? And
he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and
they shall be delivered into your
hand.
15 And the king said to him, How
many times shall I adjure thee that
thou say nothing but the truth to
me in the name of the Lord?
16 Then he said, I did see all Israel
scattered upon the mountains, as
sheep that have no shepherd: and
the Lord said, These have no master; let them return therefore every
man to his house in peace.
17 And the king of Israel said to
Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that
he would not prophesy good unto
me, but evil?
18 Again he said, Therefore hear
the word of the Lord; I saw the
Lord sitting upon his throne, and
all the host of heaven standing on
his right hand and on his left.
19 And the Lord said, Who shall
entice Ahab king of Israel, that
he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after
this manner, and another saying
after that manner.
20 Then there came out a a spirit,
and stood before the Lord, and said,
I will entice him. And the Lord said
unto him, Wherewith?
21 And he said, I will go out, and
be a lying spirit in the mouth of
all his prophets. And the Lord said,
	20	a	 jst  2 Chr. 18:20 . . . lying

	21	a	 jst  2 Chr. 18:21 . . . so;

Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt
also prevail: go out, and do even a so.
22 Now therefore, behold, the Lord
hath a put a lying spirit in the mouth
of these thy prophets, and the Lord
hath spoken evil against thee.
23 Then Zedekiah the son of
Chenaanah came near, and smote
Micaiah upon the cheek, and said,
Which way went the Spirit of the
Lord from me to speak unto thee?
24 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou
shalt see on that day when thou
shalt go into an inner chamber to
hide thyself.
25 Then the king of Israel said,
Take ye Micaiah, and carry him
back to Amon the governor of the
city, and to Joash the king’s son;
26 And say, Thus saith the king,
Put this fellow in the prison, and
feed him with bread of affliction
and with water of affliction, until
I return in peace.
27 And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath
not the Lord spoken by me. And he
said, Hearken, all ye people.
28 So the king of Israel and Jehosh­
aphat the king of Judah went up to
Ramoth-gilead.
29 And the king of Israel said unto
Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself,
and will go to the battle; but put
thou on thy robes. So the king of
Israel disguised himself; and they
went to the battle.
30 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots
that were with him, saying, Fight ye
not with small or great, save only
with the king of Israel.
31 And it came to pass, when the
captains of the chariots saw Jehosh­
aphat, that they said, It is the king
of Israel. Therefore they compassed
about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat
cried out, and the Lord helped
him; and God moved them to depart
from him.
32 For it came to pass, that,

perceived that it was not the king
of Israel, they turned back again
from pursuing him.
33 And a certain man drew a bow
at a venture, and smote the king
of Israel between the joints of the
harness: therefore he said to his
chariot man, Turn thine hand, that
thou mayest carry me out of the
host; for I am wounded.
34 And the battle increased that
day: howbeit the king of Israel
stayed himself up in his chariot
against the Syrians until the even:
and about the time of the sun going
down he died.
Chapter 19
Jehoshaphat is rebuked for helping
ungodly Ahab—He helps the people

And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah
returned to his house in peace to
Jerusalem.
2 And Jehu the son of Hanani the
a 
seer went out to meet him, and
said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love
them that hate the Lord? therefore
is wrath upon thee from before the
Lord.
3 Nevertheless there are good
things found in thee, in that thou
hast taken away the groves out of
the land, and hast prepared thine
heart to seek God.
4 And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out a again
through the people from Beer-sheba
to mount Ephraim, and brought
them back unto the Lord God of
their fathers.
5 ¶ And he set a judges in the land

the priests, and of the chief of the
fathers of Israel, for the judgment
of the Lord, and for controversies,
when they returned to Jerusalem.
9 And he charged them, saying,
Thus shall ye do in the a fear of the

It came to pass after this also, that

and, behold, they be in Hazazontamar, which is En-gedi.
3 And Jehoshaphat feared, and set
himself to seek the Lord, and proclaimed a a fast throughout all Judah.
4 And Judah gathered themselves
together, to ask help of the Lord:
even out of all the cities of Judah
they came to seek the Lord.
5 ¶ And Jehoshaphat stood in the
congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord, before the new court,
6 And said, O Lord God of our
fathers, art not thou God in heaven?
and rulest not thou over all the
kingdoms of the heathen? and in
thine hand is there not power and
might, so that none is able to withstand thee?
7 Art not thou our God, who didst
drive out the inhabitants of this
land before thy people Israel, and
gavest it to the a seed of Abraham
thy friend for ever?
8 And they dwelt therein, and have
built thee a sanctuary therein for
thy name, saying,
9 If, when evil cometh upon us,
as the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before
this house, and in thy presence, (for
thy name is in this house,) and cry
unto thee in our a affliction, then
thou wilt hear and help.
10 And now, behold, the children
of Ammon and Moab and mount
Seir, whom thou wouldest not let
Israel invade, when they came out of
the land of Egypt, but they turned
from them, and destroyed them not;
11 Behold, I say, how they reward
us, to come to cast us out of thy
possession, which thou hast given
us to inherit.
12 O our God, wilt thou not judge
them? for we have no might against
this great company that cometh
against us; neither a know we what
to do: but our eyes are upon thee.

13 And all Judah stood before the
Lord, with their little ones, their
wives, and their children.
14 ¶ Then upon Jahaziel the son of
Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the
son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah,
a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came
the Spirit of the Lord in the midst
of the congregation;
15 And he said, Hearken ye, all
Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat,
Thus saith the Lord unto you, Be
not afraid nor dismayed by reason
of this great multitude; for the a battle is not yours, but God’s.
16 To morrow go ye down against
them: behold, they come up by the
a 
cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them
at the end of the b brook, c before the
wilderness of Jeruel.
17 Ye shall not need to fight in this
battle: set yourselves, stand ye still,
and see the a salvation of the Lord
with you, O Judah and Jerusalem:
fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the
Lord will be with you.
18 And Jehoshaphat bowed his
head with his face to the ground:
and all Judah and the inhabitants
of Jerusalem fell before the Lord,
worshipping the Lord.
19 And the Levites, of the children
of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to
praise the Lord God of Israel with
a loud voice on high.
20 ¶ And they rose early in the
morning, and went forth into the
wilderness of Tekoa: and as they
went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and
said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; a Believe in
the Lord your God, so shall ye be
established; b believe his prophets,
so shall ye c prosper.
21 And when he had consulted with
the people, he appointed singers unto

the beauty of holiness, as they went
out before the army, and to say,
Praise the Lord; for his mercy endureth for ever.
22 ¶ And when they began to sing
and to praise, the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which
were come against Judah; and they
a 
were smitten.
23 For the children of Ammon and
Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay
and destroy them: and when they
had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to
destroy a another.
24 And when Judah came toward
the watch tower in the wilderness,
they looked unto the multitude, and,
behold, they were dead bodies fallen
to the earth, and none escaped.
25 And when Jehoshaphat and
his people came to take away the
spoil of them, they found among
them in abundance both riches
with the dead bodies, and precious
jewels, which they stripped off for
themselves, more than they could
carry away: and they were three
days in gathering of the spoil, it
was so much.
26 ¶ And on the fourth day they
assembled themselves in the valley
of Berachah; for there they blessed
the Lord: therefore the name of the
same place was called, The valley
of a Berachah, unto this day.
27 Then they returned, every man
of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehosh­
aphat in the forefront of them, to
go again to Jerusalem with joy; for
the Lord had made them to rejoice
over their enemies.
28 And they came to Jerusalem
with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the Lord.
29 And the fear of God was on
all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the
Lord fought against the enemies of
Israel.
30 So the realm of Jehoshaphat

was quiet: for his God gave him
rest round about.
31 ¶ And Jehoshaphat reigned over
Judah: he was thirty and five years
old when he began to reign, and
he reigned twenty and five years
in Jerusalem. And his mother’s
name was Azubah the daughter of
Shilhi.
32 And he walked in the way of
Asa his father, and departed not
from it, doing that which was right
in the sight of the Lord.
33 Howbeit the high places were
not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts
unto the God of their fathers.
34 Now the rest of the acts of
Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold,
they are written in the book of a Jehu
the son of Hanani, who is mentioned
in the book of the kings of Israel.
35 ¶ And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself
with Ahaziah king of Israel, who
did very wickedly:
36 And he joined himself with him
to make ships to go to Tarshish: and
they made the ships in Ezion-geber.
37 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah
of Mareshah prophesied against
Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou
hast joined thyself with Ahaziah,
the Lord hath broken thy works.
And the ships were broken, that
they were not able to go to Tarshish.

Michael, and Shephatiah: all these
were the sons of Jehoshaphat king
of Israel.
3 And their father gave them great
gifts of silver, and of gold, and of
precious things, with a fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave
he to Jehoram; because he was the
firstborn.
4 Now when Jehoram was risen
up to the kingdom of his father, he
strengthened himself, and slew all
his brethren with the sword, and
divers also of the princes of Israel.
5 ¶ Jehoram was thirty and two
years old when he began to reign, and
he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
6 And he walked in the way of the
kings of Israel, like as did the house
of a Ahab: for he had the daughter
of Ahab to wife: and he wrought
that which was evil in the eyes of
the Lord.
7 Howbeit the Lord would not a destroy the house of David, because
of the covenant that he had made
with David, and as he promised to
give a light to him and to his sons
for ever.
8 ¶ In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of
Judah, and made themselves a king.
9 Then Jehoram went forth with
his princes, and all his chariots with
him: and he rose up by night, and
smote the Edomites which a compassed him in, and the captains of
the chariots.
10 So the Edomites revolted from
under the hand of Judah unto this
day. The same time also did Libnah
revolt from under his hand; because
he had forsaken the Lord God of
his fathers.
11 Moreover he made high places
in the mountains of Judah, and
caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to a commit fornication, and
b 
compelled Judah thereto.

him from Elijah the prophet, saying,
Thus saith the Lord God of David
thy father, Because thou hast not
walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat
thy father, nor in the ways of a Asa
king of Judah,
13 But hast walked in the way of
the kings of Israel, and hast made
Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the
whoredoms of the house of Ahab,
and also hast slain thy brethren of
thy father’s house, which were better
than thyself:
14 Behold, with a great a plague
will the Lord smite thy people,
and thy children, and thy wives,
and all thy goods:
15 And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until
thy bowels fall out by reason of the
sickness day by day.
16 ¶ Moreover the Lord stirred up
against Jehoram the spirit of the
Philistines, and of the a Arabians,
that were near the Ethiopians:
17 And they came up into Judah,
and brake into it, and carried away
all the substance that was found in
the king’s house, and his sons also,
and his wives; so that there was
never a son left him, save a Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.
18 ¶ And after all this the Lord
smote him in his bowels with an
incurable disease.
19 And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two
years, his bowels fell out by reason
of his sickness: so he died of sore
diseases. And his people made no
a 
burning for him, like the burning
of his fathers.
20 Thirty and two years old was
he when he began to reign, and he
reigned in Jerusalem eight years,
and departed without being desired.

Chapter 22
Ahaziah reigns in wickedness and is
slain by Jehu; his mother, Athaliah,
reigns in his stead.
And the inhabitants of Jerusalem
made Ahaziah his youngest son
king in his stead: for the band of
men that came with the a Arabians
to the camp had slain all the eldest.
So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king
of Judah reigned.
2 a Forty and two years old was
b 
Ahaziah when he began to reign,
and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was
Athaliah the c daughter of Omri.
3 He also walked in the ways of
the house of a Ahab: for his b mother
was his counsellor to do wickedly.
4 Wherefore he did evil in the
sight of the Lord like the house of
Ahab: for they were his counsellors
after the death of his father to his
destruction.
5 ¶ He walked also after their
counsel, and went with a Jehoram
the son of Ahab king of Israel to
war against Hazael king of Syria
at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians
smote Joram.
6 And he returned to be healed
in Jezreel because of the wounds
which were given him at Ramah,
when he fought with Hazael king
of Syria. And a Azariah the son of
Jehoram king of Judah went down
to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at
Jezreel, because he was sick.
7 And the destruction of Ahaziah
was of God by coming to Joram: for
when he was come, he went out with
Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the Lord had a anointed
to cut off the house of Ahab.
8 And it came to pass, that, when
Jehu was executing judgment upon
the house of Ahab, and found the

princes of Judah, and the sons of
the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.
9 And he sought Ahaziah: and they
caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu:
and when they had a slain him, they
buried him: Because, said they, he is
the b son of Jehoshaphat, who sought
the Lord with all his heart. So the
house of Ahaziah had no power to
keep still the kingdom.
10 ¶ But when a Athaliah the
mother of Ahaziah saw that her son
was dead, she arose and destroyed all
the seed royal of the house of Judah.
11 But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son
of Ahaziah, and stole him from
among the king’s sons that were
slain, and put him and his nurse in
a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the
daughter of king Jehoram, the wife
of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was
the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from
Athaliah, so that she slew him not.
12 And he was with them hid in
the house of God six years: and
Athaliah reigned over the land.
Chapter 23
Jehoiada the priest makes Joash king—
Athaliah is slain—Worship of the Lord is

And in the seventh year Jehoiada
strengthened himself, and took the
captains of hundreds, Azariah the
son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son
of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son
of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of
Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of
Zichri, into a covenant with him.

and gathered the Levites out of all
the cities of Judah, and the chief of
the fathers of Israel, and they came
to Jerusalem.

3 And all the congregation made
a covenant with the king in the
house of God. And he said unto
them, Behold, the king’s son shall
reign, as the Lord hath said of the
sons of a David.
4 This is the thing that ye shall do;
A third part of you entering on the
sabbath, of the priests and of the
Levites, shall be porters of the doors;
5 And a third part shall be at the
king’s house; and a third part at
the a gate of the foundation: and
all the people shall be in the courts
of the house of the Lord.
6 But let none come into the house
of the Lord, save the priests, and
they that a minister of the Levites;
they shall go in, for they are holy:
but all the people shall keep the
watch of the Lord.
7 And the Levites shall compass the
king round about, every man with
his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the house,
he shall be put to death: but be ye
with the king when he cometh in,
and when he goeth out.
8 So the Levites and all Judah did
according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and
took every man his men that were to
come in on the sabbath, with them
that were to go out on the sabbath:
for Jehoiada the priest dismissed
not the courses.
9 Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds
spears, and bucklers, and shields,
that had been king David’s, which
were in the house of God.
10 And he set all the people, every
man having his weapon in his hand,
from the right side of the temple
to the left side of the temple, along
by the altar and the temple, by the
king round about.
11 Then they brought out the king’s
son, and put upon him the crown,
and gave him the a testimony, and
made him king. And Jehoiada and

his sons anointed him, and said,
God save the king.
12 ¶ Now when Athaliah heard
the noise of the people running and
praising the king, she came to the
people into the house of the Lord:
13 And she looked, and, behold,
the king stood at his pillar at the
entering in, and the princes and
the trumpets by the king: and all
the people of the land rejoiced, and
sounded with trumpets, also the
singers with instruments of musick,
and such as taught to a sing praise.
Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and
said, Treason, Treason.
14 Then Jehoiada the priest
brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host,
and said unto them, Have her forth
a 
of the ranges: and whoso followeth
her, let him be slain with the sword.
For the priest said, Slay her not in
the house of the Lord.
15 So they laid hands on her; and
when she was come to the entering of the a horse gate by the king’s
house, they slew her there.
16 ¶ And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between
all the people, and between the
king, that they should be the Lord’s
people.
17 Then all the people went to the
house of Baal, and brake it down,
and brake his altars and his images
in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest
of Baal before the altars.
18 Also Jehoiada appointed the
offices of the house of the Lord
by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed
in the house of the Lord, to offer
the a burnt offerings of the Lord,
as it is written in the law of Moses,
with rejoicing and with singing, as
it was ordained by David.
19 And he set the porters at the
gates of the house of the Lord, that
none which was unclean in any thing
should enter in.

people of the land, and brought
down the king from the house of
the Lord: and they came through
the high gate into the king’s house,
and set the king upon the throne
of the kingdom.

rejoiced: and the city was quiet,
after that they had slain Athaliah
with the sword.
Chapter 24
Joash and Jehoiada receive contributions and repair the house of the
Lord —Jehoiada dies—Joash falls
into idolatry, slays a prophet named
Zechariah, and is himself slain in a
conspiracy.
Joash was seven years old when he
began to reign, and he reigned forty
years in Jerusalem. His mother’s
name also was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.
2 And Joash did that which was
right in the sight of the Lord all
the days of Jehoiada the priest.
3 And Jehoiada took for him
two wives; and he begat sons and
daughters.
4 ¶ And it came to pass after this,
that Joash was minded to repair the
house of the Lord.
5 And he gathered together the
priests and the Levites, and said
to them, Go out unto the cities
of Judah, and gather of all Israel
money to repair the house of your
God from year to year, and see that
ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the
Levites hastened it not.
6 And the king called for Jehoiada
the chief, and said unto him, Why
hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and
out of Jerusalem the a collection,
according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the Lord, and of
the congregation of Israel, for the
b 
tabernacle of witness?

wicked woman, had broken up the
house of God; and also all the dedi­
cated things of the house of the
Lord did they bestow upon Baalim.
8 And at the king’s commandment
they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the
Lord.
9 And they made a proclamation
through Judah and Jerusalem, to
bring in to the Lord the collection
that Moses the servant of God laid
upon Israel in the wilderness.
10 And all the princes and all the
people rejoiced, and brought in,
and cast into the chest, until they
had made an end.
11 Now it came to pass, that at
what time the chest was brought
unto the king’s office by the hand of
the Levites, and when they saw that
there was much a money, the king’s
scribe and the high priest’s officer
came and emptied the chest, and
took it, and carried it to his place
again. Thus they did day by day,
and gathered money in abundance.
12 And the king and Jehoiada gave
it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the Lord, and
hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the Lord, and also
such as wrought iron and brass to
mend the house of the Lord.
13 So the workmen wrought, and
the work was perfected by them,
and they set the house of God in
his state, and strengthened it.
14 And when they had finished
it, they brought the rest of the
money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made a vessels
for the house of the Lord, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal,
and spoons, and vessels of gold and
silver. And they offered burnt off­
erings in the house of the Lord
continually all the days of Jehoiada.
15 ¶ But Jehoiada waxed old, and
was full of days when he died; an
hundred and thirty years old was
he when he died.
16 And they buried him in the city

of David among the kings, because
he had done good in Israel, both
toward God, and toward his house.
17 Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and
made obeisance to the king. Then
the king hearkened unto them.
18 And they left the house of the
Lord God of their fathers, and
served groves and a idols: and wrath
came upon Judah and Jerusalem for
this their trespass.
19 Yet he a sent b prophets to them,
to bring them again unto the Lord;
and they c testified against them:
but they would not give ear.
20 And the a Spirit of God came
upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada
the priest, which stood above the
people, and said unto them, Thus
saith God, Why transgress ye the
commandments of the Lord, that
ye cannot b prosper? because ye
have forsaken the Lord, he hath
also forsaken you.
21 And they conspired against
him, and a stoned him with stones
at the commandment of the king in
the court of the house of the Lord.
22 Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him,
but slew his son. And when he died,
he said, The Lord look upon it, and
require it.
23 ¶ And it came to pass at the
end of the year, that the host of
Syria came up against him: and
they came to Judah and Jerusalem,
and destroyed all the princes of the
people from among the people, and
sent all the spoil of them unto the
king of Damascus.
24 For the army of the Syrians
came with a small company of men,
and the Lord delivered a very great
host into their hand, because they
had forsaken the Lord God of their
fathers. So they executed judgment
against Joash.

25 And when they were departed
from him, (for they left him a in
great diseases,) his own servants
conspired against him for the blood
of the sons of Jehoiada the priest,
and slew him on his bed, and he
died: and they buried him in the
city of David, but they buried him
not in the b sepulchres of the kings.
26 And these are they that conspired against him; a Zabad the son
of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and
Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a
Moabitess.
27 ¶ Now concerning his sons, and
the greatness of the burdens laid
upon him, and the repairing of
the house of God, behold, they are
written in the story of the book of
the kings. And Amaziah his son
reigned in his stead.
Chapter 25
Amaziah reigns, smites the Edomites,
and worships false gods—A prophet
foretells Amaziah’s destruction—Judah
is defeated by Israel, and Amaziah is
slain in a conspiracy.
Amaziah was twenty and five years
old when he began to reign, and he
reigned twenty and nine years in
Jerusalem. And his mother’s name
was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
2 And he did that which was right
in the sight of the Lord, but not
a 
with a perfect heart.
3 ¶ Now it came to pass, when the
kingdom was established to him,
that he slew his servants that had
killed the king his father.
4 But he slew not their children,
but did as it is written in the law in
the book of Moses, where the Lord
commanded, saying, The fathers
shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the
fathers, but every man shall die for
his own a sin.
5 ¶ Moreover Amaziah gathered

Judah together, and made them
captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to
the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he
numbered them from twenty years
old and above, and found them three
hundred thousand choice men, able
to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.
6 He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of
Israel for an hundred talents of
silver.
7 But there came a man of God
to him, saying, O king, let not the
army of Israel go with thee; for the
Lord is not with Israel, to wit, with
all the children of Ephraim.
8 But if thou wilt go, do it, be
strong for the battle: God shall make
thee fall before the enemy: for God
hath a power to help, and to cast
down.
9 And Amaziah said to the man of
God, But what shall we do for the
hundred talents which I have given
to the army of Israel? And the man
of God answered, The Lord is able
to give thee much more than this.
10 Then Amaziah separated them,
to wit, the army that was come to
him out of Ephraim, to go home
again: wherefore their anger was
greatly kindled against Judah, and
they returned home in great anger.
11 ¶ And Amaziah strengthened
himself, and led forth his people,
and went to the a valley of salt, and
smote of the children of Seir ten
thousand.
12 And other ten thousand left alive
did the children of Judah carry away
captive, and brought them unto the
top of the rock, and cast them down
from the top of the rock, that they
all were broken in pieces.
13 ¶ But the soldiers of the army
which Amaziah sent back, that they
should not go with him to battle,
fell upon the cities of Judah, from
Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and
	8	a	 D&C 60:4.
	11	a	 ie  by the Dead Sea.
	15	a	 2 Ne. 9:37.

smote three thousand of them, and
took much spoil.
14 ¶ Now it came to pass, after
that Amaziah was come from the
slaughter of the Edomites, that he
brought the gods of the children
of Seir, and set them up to be his
gods, and bowed down himself
before them, and burned incense
unto them.
15 Wherefore the a anger of the
Lord was kindled against Amaziah,
and he sent unto him a prophet,
which said unto him, Why hast thou
sought after the gods of the people,
which could not deliver their own
people out of thine hand?
16 And it came to pass, as he talked
with him, that the king said unto
him, a Art thou made of the king’s
counsel? forbear; why shouldest
thou be smitten? Then the prophet
forbare, and said, I know that God
hath determined to destroy thee,
because thou hast done this, and
hast not hearkened unto my counsel.
17 ¶ Then Amaziah king of Judah
took advice, and sent to Joash, the
son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu,
king of Israel, saying, Come, a let us
see one another in the face.
18 And Joash king of Israel sent
to Amaziah king of Judah, saying,
The thistle that was in Lebanon sent
to the cedar that was in Lebanon,
saying, Give thy daughter to my
son to wife: and there passed by
a wild beast that was in Lebanon,
and trode down the thistle.
19 Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart
lifteth thee up to boast: abide now
at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest
fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
20 But Amaziah would not hear;
for it came of God, that he might
deliver them into the hand of their
enemies, because they sought after
the gods of Edom.
21 So Joash the king of Israel went
up; and they saw one another in the

face, both he and Amaziah king of
Judah, at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.
22 And Judah was put to the worse
before Israel, and they fled every
man to his tent.
23 And Joash the king of Israel
took Amaziah king of Judah, the
son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz,
at Beth-shemesh, and brought him
to Jerusalem, and brake down the
a 
wall of Jerusalem from the gate of
Ephraim to the corner gate, four
hundred cubits.
24 And he took all the gold and the
silver, and all the vessels that were
found in the house of God with
Obed-edom, and the treasures of
the king’s house, the hostages also,
and returned to Samaria.
25 ¶ And Amaziah the son of Joash
king of Judah lived after the death
of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of
Israel fifteen years.
26 Now the rest of the acts of
Amaziah, first and last, behold, are
they not written in the book of the
kings of Judah and Israel?
27 ¶ Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following
the Lord they made a conspiracy
against him in Jerusalem; and he
fled to Lachish: but they sent to
Lachish after him, and slew him
there.
28 And they brought him upon
horses, and buried him with his
fathers in the city of Judah.
Chapter 26
Uzziah reigns and prospers as long as
he keeps the commandments—He transgresses, attempts to burn incense upon
the altar, and is cursed with leprosy.
Then all the people of Judah took
a 
Uzziah, who was sixteen years old,
and made him king in the room of
his father Amaziah.
2 He built Eloth, and restored it
to Judah, after that the king slept
with his fathers.
	23	a	 2 Chr. 32:5 (5–26).
26	1	a	 or  Azariah (see
2 Kgs. 14:21; 15:1).

3 Sixteen years old was Uzziah
when he began to reign, and he
reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also
was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
4 And he did that which was right
in the sight of the Lord, according
to all that his father Amaziah did.
5 And he sought God in the days of
Zechariah, who had understanding
in the a visions of God: and as long
as he sought the Lord, God made
him to b prosper.
6 And he went forth and warred
against the Philistines, and brake
down the wall of Gath, and the wall
of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod,
and built cities about Ashdod, and
among the Philistines.
7 And God helped him against the
Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the
Mehunims.
8 And the Ammonites gave gifts
to Uzziah: and his name spread
abroad even to the entering in of
Egypt; for he strengthened himself
exceedingly.
9 Moreover Uzziah built towers in
Jerusalem at the corner gate, and
at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.
10 Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he
had much cattle, both in the low
country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the
mountains, and in a Carmel: for he
loved b husbandry.
11 Moreover Uzziah had an host of
fighting men, that went out to war
by bands, according to the number
of their account by the hand of Jeiel
the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler,
under the hand of Hananiah, one
of the king’s captains.
12 The whole number of the chief
of the fathers of the mighty men of
valour were two thousand and six
hundred.
13 And under their hand was an
army, three hundred thousand and

	5	a	 2 Ne. 4:23.

	10	a	 or  fruitful fields.

		b	 heb  the soil.

2 Chronicles 26:14–27:6
seven thousand and five hundred,
that made war with mighty power,
to help the king against the enemy.
14 And Uzziah prepared for them
throughout all the host shields, and
spears, and helmets, and a habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast
stones.
15 And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men,
to be on the towers and upon the
bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great
stones withal. And his name spread
far abroad; for he was marvellously
helped, till he was strong.
16 ¶ But when he was strong, his
heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the
Lord his God, and went into the
temple of the Lord to burn incense
upon the altar of incense.
17 And a Azariah the priest went
in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the Lord, that were
valiant men:
18 And they withstood Uzziah the
king, and said unto him, It a appertaineth b not unto thee, Uzziah, to
c 
burn incense unto the Lord, but to
the priests the sons of d Aaron, that
are consecrated to burn e incense: go
out of the sanctuary; for thou hast
trespassed; neither shall it be for
thine honour from the Lord God.
19 Then Uzziah was wroth, and
had a censer in his hand to burn
incense: and while he was wroth
with the priests, the leprosy even
rose up in his forehead before the
priests in the house of the Lord,
from beside the incense altar.
20 And Azariah the chief priest,
and all the priests, looked upon
him, and, behold, he was leprous
in his forehead, and they thrust
him out from thence; yea, himself
hasted also to go out, because the
Lord had a smitten him.

a 
leper unto the day of his death,
and dwelt in a b several house, being
a leper; for he was cut off from the
house of the Lord: and Jotham his
son was over the king’s house, judging the people of the land.
22 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of
Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the
prophet, the son of Amoz, a write.
23 So Uzziah slept with his fathers,
and they buried him with his fa­
thers in the field of the burial which
belonged to the kings; for they said,
He is a leper: and Jotham his son
reigned in his stead.

Chapter 27
Jotham reigns, builds up the kingdom,
and subdues the Ammonites.
Jotham was a twenty and five years
old when he began to reign, and he
reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
His mother’s name also was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.
2 And he did that which was right
in the sight of the Lord, according
to all that his father Uzziah did:
howbeit he entered not into the
temple of the Lord. And the people did yet corruptly.
3 He built the high a gate of the
house of the Lord, and on the wall
of Ophel he built much.
4 Moreover he built cities in the
mountains of Judah, and in the
forests he built a castles and towers.
5 ¶ He fought also with the king
of the Ammonites, and prevailed
against them. And the children of
Ammon gave him the same year an
hundred talents of silver, and ten
thousand measures of wheat, and ten
thousand of barley. So much did the
children of Ammon pay unto him,
both the second year, and the third.
6 So Jotham became mighty, because he a prepared his ways before
the Lord his God.

7 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of
Jotham, and all his wars, and his
ways, lo, they are written in the book
of the kings of Israel and Judah.
8 He was five and twenty years
old when he began to reign, and
reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
9 ¶ And Jotham slept with his
fathers, and they buried him in
the city of David: and Ahaz his son
reigned in his stead.
Chapter 28
Ahaz reigns in wickedness and practices idolatry; his people are defeated
by Israel—The captives are freed by the
command of a prophet—The Edomites
and Philistines attack Judah—Ahaz
continues his idolatrous ways.
Ahaz was twenty years old when he
began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did
not that which was right in the sight
of the Lord, like David his father:
2 For he walked in the ways of
the kings of Israel, and made also
molten a images for Baalim.
3 Moreover he burnt incense in
the valley of the son of Hinnom,
and burnt his children in the a fire,
after the abominations of the heathen whom the Lord had cast out
before the children of Israel.
4 He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the
hills, and under every green tree.
5 Wherefore the Lord his God
delivered him into the hand of the
a 
king of Syria; and they smote him,
and carried away a great multitude
of them captives, and brought them
to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of
Israel, who smote him with a great
slaughter.
6 ¶ For a Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and
twenty thousand in one day, which
were all valiant men; because they
had forsaken the Lord God of their
fathers.
28	2	a	 Ex. 34:17.
	3	a	 2 Kgs. 21:6; 2 Chr. 33:6;
Ezek. 20:26.

7 And Zichri, a mighty man of
Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king’s
son, and Azrikam the governor of
the house, and Elkanah that was
next to the king.
8 And the children of Israel carried
away captive of their brethren two
hundred thousand, women, sons,
and daughters, and took also away
much spoil from them, and brought
the spoil to Samaria.
9 But a prophet of the Lord was
there, whose name was Oded: and he
went out before the host that came
to Samaria, and said unto them,
Behold, because the Lord God of
your fathers was wroth with Judah,
he hath delivered them into your
hand, and ye have slain them in a
rage that reacheth up unto heaven.
10 And now ye purpose to a keep
under the children of Judah and
Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not
with you, even with you, sins against
the Lord your God?
11 Now hear me therefore, and deliver the a captives again, which ye
have taken captive of your brethren:
for the fierce wrath of the Lord is
upon you.
12 Then certain of the heads of
the children of Ephraim, Azariah
the son of Johanan, Berechiah the
son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah
the son of Shallum, and Amasa the
son of Hadlai, stood up against
them that came from the war,
13 And said unto them, Ye shall
not bring in the captives hither: for
whereas we have a offended against
the Lord already, ye intend to add
more to our sins and to our trespass:
for our trespass is great, and there is
fierce wrath against Israel.
14 So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes
and all the congregation.
15 And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took
the captives, and with the spoil
clothed all that were naked among

them, and arrayed them, and shod
them, and gave them to a eat and
to drink, and anointed them, and
carried all the feeble of them upon
asses, and brought them to Jericho,
the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.
16 ¶ At that time did king Ahaz
send unto the kings of a Assyria to
help him.
17 For again the Edomites had
come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.
18 The Philistines also had invaded
the cities of the low country, and of
the south of Judah, and had taken
Beth-shemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages
thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.
19 For the Lord brought Judah low
because of Ahaz king of Israel; for
he made Judah a naked, and transgressed sore against the Lord.
20 And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed
him, but strengthened him not.
21 For Ahaz a took away a portion
out of the house of the Lord, and out
of the house of the king, and of the
princes, and gave it unto the king
of Assyria: but he helped him not.
22 ¶ And in the time of his distress
did he trespass yet more against the
Lord: this is that king Ahaz.
23 For he sacrificed unto the gods
of Damascus, which smote him: and
he said, Because the gods of the
kings of Syria help them, therefore
will I sacrifice to them, that they
may help me. But they were the
a 
ruin of him, and of all Israel.
24 And Ahaz gathered together the
vessels of the house of God, and cut
in pieces the vessels of the house of
God, and shut up the doors of the
house of the Lord, and he made him
altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
25 And in every a several city of
Judah he made high places to burn

incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the Lord God of
his fathers.
26 ¶ Now the rest of his acts and of
all his ways, first and last, behold,
they are written in the book of the
kings of Judah and Israel.
27 And Ahaz slept with his fathers,
and they buried him in the city,
even in Jerusalem: but they brought
him not into the a sepulchres of the
kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his
son reigned in his stead.
Chapter 29
Hezekiah reigns in righteousness and
restores the worship of Jehovah—The
Levites cleanse and sanctify the house
of the Lord—The priests offer sacrifices
and make reconciliation and atonement
for the people—Hezekiah and all the
people worship the Lord and praise
His name.
Hezekiah began to a reign when he
was five and twenty years old, and
he reigned nine and twenty years
in Jerusalem. And his mother’s
name was Abijah, the daughter of
Zechariah.
2 And he did that which was right in
the sight of the Lord, according to
all that David his father had done.
3 ¶ He in the first year of his reign,
in the first month, opened the doors
of the house of the Lord, and repaired them.
4 And he brought in the priests
and the Levites, and gathered them
together into the east street,
5 And said unto them, Hear me,
ye Levites, a sanctify now yourselves,
and sanctify the house of the Lord
God of your fathers, and carry forth
the b filthiness out of the holy place.
6 For our fathers have a trespassed,
and done that which was evil in the
eyes of the Lord our God, and have
forsaken him, and have turned away
their faces from the habitation of
the Lord, and turned their backs.

7 Also they have shut up the doors
of the porch, and put out the lamps,
and have not burned incense nor
offered burnt offerings in the holy
place unto the God of Israel.
8 Wherefore the wrath of the Lord
was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and
he hath delivered them to trouble,
to astonishment, and to hissing, as
ye see with your eyes.
9 For, lo, our fathers have fallen
by the sword, and our sons and our
daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
10 Now it is in mine heart to make
a covenant with the Lord God of
Israel, that his fierce wrath may
turn away from us.
11 My sons, be not now negligent:
for the Lord hath a chosen you to
stand before him, to serve him, and
that ye should minister unto him,
and burn incense.
12 ¶ Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel
the son of Azariah, of the sons of
the Kohathites: and of the sons of
Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and
Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and
of the Gershonites; Joah the son of
Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:
13 And of the sons of Elizaphan;
Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of
Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:
14 And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons
of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.
15 And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and
came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of
the Lord, to cleanse the house of the
Lord.
16 And the priests went into the
inner part of the house of the Lord,
to cleanse it, and brought out all the
uncleanness that they found in the
temple of the Lord into the court
of the house of the Lord. And the
Levites took it, to carry it out abroad
into the brook Kidron.

day of the first month to sanctify,
and on the eighth day of the month
came they to the porch of the Lord:
so they sanctified the house of the
Lord in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they
made an end.
18 Then they went in to Hezekiah
the king, and said, We have cleansed
all the house of the Lord, and the
altar of burnt offering, with all the
vessels thereof, and the shewbread
table, with all the vessels thereof.
19 Moreover all the vessels, which
king Ahaz in his reign did cast away
in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold,
they are before the altar of the Lord.
20 ¶ Then Hezekiah the king rose
early, and gathered the rulers of
the city, and went up to the house
of the Lord.
21 And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven
lambs, and seven he goats, for a a sin
offering for the kingdom, and for
the sanctuary, and for Judah. And
he commanded the priests the sons
of Aaron to offer them on the altar
of the Lord.
22 So they killed the bullocks, and
the priests received the blood, and
a 
sprinkled it on the altar: likewise,
when they had killed the rams, they
sprinkled the blood upon the altar:
they killed also the lambs, and they
sprinkled the blood upon the altar.
23 And they brought forth the he
goats for the sin offering before the
king and the congregation; and they
laid their hands upon them:
24 And the priests killed them,
and they made a reconciliation with
their blood upon the altar, to make
an b atonement for all Israel: for the
king commanded that the burnt off­
ering and the sin offering should be
made for all Israel.
25 And he set the a Levites in the
house of the Lord with cymbals,
with psalteries, and with harps,
according to the commandment of

26 And the Levites stood with
the a instruments of David, and the
priests with the trumpets.
27 And Hezekiah commanded to
offer the burnt offering upon the altar.
And when the burnt offering began,
the song of the Lord began also with
the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel.
28 And all the a congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and
the trumpeters sounded: and all this
continued until the burnt offering
was finished.
29 And when they had made an
end of offering, the king and all
that were present with him bowed
themselves, and worshipped.
30 Moreover Hezekiah the king and
the princes commanded the Levites
to sing praise unto the Lord with
the words of David, and of Asaph
the a seer. And they sang praises
with gladness, and they bowed their
heads and worshipped.
31 Then Hezekiah answered and
said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the Lord, come near and
bring sacrifices and a thank offerings
into the house of the Lord. And the
congregation brought in sacrifices
and thank offerings; and as many as
were of a b free heart burnt offerings.
32 And the number of the burnt
offerings, which the congregation
brought, was threescore and ten
bullocks, an hundred rams, and two
hundred lambs: all these were for a
burnt offering to the Lord.
33 And the consecrated things
were six hundred oxen and three
thousand sheep.
34 But the a priests were too few, so
that they could not flay all the burnt
offerings: wherefore their brethren

the Levites did help them, till the
work was ended, and until the other
priests had b sanctified themselves:
for the Levites were more upright in
heart to sanctify themselves than
the priests.
35 And also the burnt offerings
were in abundance, with the fat of
the peace a offerings, and the drink
b 
offerings for every burnt offering.
So the service of the house of the
Lord was set in c order.
36 And Hezekiah rejoiced, and
all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was
done suddenly.
Chapter 30
Hezekiah invites all Israel to a solemn
Passover in Jerusalem—Some accept
the call; others laugh him to scorn—
The faithful Israelites worship the Lord
in Jerusalem.
And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and
Judah, and wrote letters also to
Ephraim and Manasseh, that they
should come to the house of the
Lord at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the Lord God of Israel.
2 For the king had taken counsel,
and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the
passover in the a second month.
3 For they could not keep it at a that
time, because the priests had not
sanctified themselves sufficiently,
neither had the people gathered
themselves together to Jerusalem.
4 And the thing pleased the king
and all the congregation.
5 So they established a decree to
make proclamation throughout
all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to
Dan, that they should come to keep
the passover unto the Lord God of
Israel at Jerusalem: for they had
not done it a of a long time in such
sort as it was written.

6 So the a posts went with the letters from the king and his princes
throughout all Israel and Judah,
and according to the commandment
of the king, saying, Ye children of
Israel, b turn again unto the Lord
God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,
and he will return to the remnant
of you, that are escaped out of the
hand of the kings of Assyria.
7 And be not ye like your a fathers,
and like your brethren, which trespassed against the Lord God of their
fathers, who therefore gave them up
to desolation, as ye see.
8 Now be ye not a stiffnecked, as
your fathers were, but b yield yourselves unto the Lord, and enter into
his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the Lord
your God, that the fierceness of his
wrath may turn away from you.
9 For if ye a turn again unto the
Lord, your brethren and your
children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive,
so that they shall come again into
this land: for the Lord your God
is gracious and b merciful, and will
not turn away his face from you, if
ye return unto him.
10 So the posts passed from city to
city through the country of Ephraim
and Manasseh even unto Zebulun:
but they laughed them to scorn,
and a mocked them.
11 Nevertheless a divers of Asher
and Manasseh and of Zebulun
humbled themselves, and came to
Jerusalem.
12 Also in Judah the hand of God
was to give them a one heart to do the
commandment of the king and of the
princes, by the word of the Lord.
13 ¶ And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast
of a unleavened bread in the second
month, a very great congregation.

14 And they arose and took away
the altars that were in Jerusalem,
and all the altars for incense took
they away, and cast them into the
brook Kidron.
15 Then they killed the passover
on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the
Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in
the burnt offerings into the house
of the Lord.
16 And they stood in their place
after their manner, according to
the law of Moses the man of God:
the priests sprinkled the a blood,
which they received of the hand of
the Levites.
17 For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified:
therefore the Levites had the charge
of the killing of the passovers for
every one that was not clean, to
sanctify them unto the Lord.
18 For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and
Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun,
had not a cleansed themselves, yet
did they eat the passover otherwise
than it was written. But Hezekiah
prayed for them, saying, The good
Lord pardon every one
19 That prepareth his heart to seek
God, the Lord God of his fathers,
though he be not cleansed according
to the purification of the sanctuary.
20 And the Lord hearkened to
Hezekiah, and a healed the people.
21 And the children of Israel that
were present at Jerusalem kept the
feast of unleavened bread seven
days with great gladness: and the
Levites and the priests praised the
Lord day by day, singing with loud
instruments unto the Lord.
22 And Hezekiah spake a comfortably unto all the Levites that taught
the good knowledge of the Lord:

and they did eat throughout the
feast seven days, offering peace
offerings, and making b confession
to the Lord God of their fathers.
23 And the whole assembly took
counsel to keep other seven days:
and they kept other seven days with
gladness.
24 For Hezekiah king of Judah did
give to the congregation a thousand
bullocks and seven thousand sheep;
and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten
thousand sheep: and a great number
of priests a sanctified themselves.
25 And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that
came out of Israel, and the strangers
that came out of the land of Israel,
and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.
26 So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon
the son of David king of Israel there
was not the like in Jerusalem.
27 ¶ Then the priests the Levites
arose and a blessed the people: and
their voice was heard, and their
prayer came up to his holy dwelling
place, even unto heaven.
Chapter 31
The faithful Israelites overthrow false
worship among them—The people pay
tithes and offerings—The Levites administer in temporal matters—Hezekiah
serves faithfully.
Now when all this was finished, all
Israel that were present went out to
the cities of Judah, and brake the
a 
images in pieces, and cut down
the b groves, and threw down the
c 
high places and the altars out of all
Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim
also and Manasseh, until they had
utterly destroyed them all. Then
all the children of Israel returned,
every man to his possession, into
their own cities.

according to his service, the priests
and Levites for burnt offerings and
for peace offerings, to minister, and
to give thanks, and to praise in the
gates of the b tents of the Lord.
3 He appointed also the king’s portion of his substance for the burnt
offerings, to wit, for the morning
and evening burnt a offerings, and
the burnt offerings for the b sabbaths, and for the c new moons, and
for the set d feasts, as it is written in
the law of the Lord.
4 Moreover he commanded the
people that dwelt in Jerusalem to
give the portion of the priests and
the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the Lord.
5 ¶ And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of
Israel brought in abundance the
firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil,
and honey, and of all the increase
of the field; and the a tithe of all
things brought they in abundantly.
6 And concerning the children of
Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the
cities of Judah, they also brought
in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and
the tithe of holy things which were
consecrated unto the Lord their
God, and laid them by heaps.
7 In the third month they began to
lay the foundation of the heaps, and
finished them in the seventh month.
8 And when Hezekiah and the
princes came and saw the heaps,
they blessed the Lord, and his people Israel.
9 Then Hezekiah questioned with
the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
10 And Azariah the chief priest of
the house of Zadok answered him,
and said, Since the people began to

eat, and have left plenty: for the

that which is left is this great store.
11 ¶ Then Hezekiah commanded to
prepare a chambers in the house of
the Lord; and they prepared them,
12 And brought in the offerings
and the tithes and the dedicated
things faithfully: over which Cono­
niah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei
his brother was the next.
13 And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and
Nahath, and Asahel, and Jeri­moth,
and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah,
were overseers under the hand of
Cononiah and Shimei his brother,
at the commandment of Hezekiah
the king, and Azariah the ruler of
the house of God.
14 And Kore the son of Imnah the
Levite, the porter toward the east,
was over the freewill offerings of
God, to distribute the a oblations of
the Lord, and the most holy things.
15 And a next him were Eden, and
Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shem­
aiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in
the b cities of the priests, in their
set office, to give to their brethren
by courses, as well to the great as
to the small:

through all the congregation: for
in their set office they sanctified
themselves in holiness:

priests, which were in the a fields of
the b suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were
expressed by name, to give portions
to all the males among the priests,
and to all that were reckoned by
genealogies among the Levites.
20 ¶ And thus did Hezekiah
throughout all Judah, and wrought
that which was good and right and
truth before the Lord his God.
21 And in every work that he began in the service of the house of
God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did
it with all his heart, and prospered.
Chapter 32
Sennacherib invades Judah and besieges
the cities—He rails against the Lord—
Isaiah and Hezekiah pray, and an angel destroys the leaders of the Assyrian
armies—Hezekiah reigns in righteousness despite some pride in his heart.
After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king
of Assyria came, and entered into
Judah, and encamped against the
fenced cities, and thought to win
them for himself.
2 And when Hezekiah saw that
Sennacherib was come, and that
he was purposed to fight against
Jerusalem,
3 He took counsel with his princes
and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him.
4 So there was gathered much
people together, who stopped all
the fountains, and the brook that
ran through the midst of the land,
saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?
5 Also he strengthened himself,
and built up all the a wall that was
broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and
repaired b Millo in the city of David,

and made c darts and shields in
abundance.
6 And he set captains of war over
the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the
gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,
7 Be strong and courageous, be not
afraid nor dismayed for the king of
Assyria, nor for all the multitude
that is with him: for there be more
with us than with him:
8 With him is an arm of a flesh; but
with us is the Lord our God to help
us, and to fight our battles. And the
people b rested themselves upon the
words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
9 ¶ After this did Sennacherib
king of Assyria a send his servants to
Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege
against Lachish, and all his power
with him,) unto Hezekiah king of
Judah, and unto all Judah that were
at Jerusalem, saying,
10 Thus saith Sennacherib king of
Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that
ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?
11 Doth not Hezekiah persuade
you to give over yourselves to die
by famine and by thirst, saying, The
Lord our God shall deliver us out
of the hand of the king of Assyria?
12 Hath not the same Hezekiah
taken away his a high places and his
altars, and commanded Judah and
Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship
before one altar, and burn incense
upon it?
13 Know ye not what I and my
fathers have done unto all the people of other lands? were the gods of
the nations of those lands any ways
able to deliver their lands out of
mine hand?
14 Who was there among all the
gods of those nations that my fathers
utterly destroyed, that could deliver
his people out of mine hand, that
your God should be able to deliver
you out of mine hand?
15 Now therefore let not Hezekiah

this manner, neither yet believe
him: for no god of any nation or
kingdom was able to deliver his
people out of mine hand, and out of
the hand of my fathers: how much
less shall your God deliver you out
of mine hand?
16 And his servants spake yet more
against the Lord God, and against
his servant Hezekiah.
17 He wrote also letters to rail
on the Lord God of Israel, and to
speak against him, saying, As the
gods of the nations of other lands
have not delivered their people
out of mine hand, so shall not the
God of Hezekiah deliver his people
out of mine hand.
18 Then they cried with a loud
voice in the Jews’ a speech unto the
people of Jerusalem that were on
the wall, to affright them, and to
trouble them; that they might take
the city.
19 And they spake against the God
of Jerusalem, as against the gods of
the people of the earth, which were
the work of the hands of man.
20 And for this cause Hezekiah
the king, and the prophet Isaiah
the son of Amoz, prayed and cried
to heaven.
21 ¶ And the Lord sent an a angel,
which cut off all the mighty men of
valour, and the leaders and captains
in the camp of the king of Assyria.
So he returned with shame of face
to his own land. And when he was
come into the house of his god, they
that came forth of his own bowels
slew him there with the sword.
22 Thus the Lord saved Hezekiah
and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
from the hand of Sennacherib the
king of Assyria, and from the hand
of all other, and guided them on
every side.
23 And many brought gifts unto
the Lord to Jerusalem, and presents
to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that
he was magnified in the sight of all
nations from thenceforth.

24 ¶ In those days Hezekiah was
sick to the death, and prayed unto
the Lord: and he spake unto him,
and he gave him a a sign.
25 But Hezekiah rendered not
again according to the benefit done
unto him; for his heart was lifted
up: therefore there was wrath upon
him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
26 Notwithstanding Hezekiah
humbled himself for the pride of his
heart, both he and the inhabitants
of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of
the Lord came not upon them in
the days of Hezekiah.
27 ¶ And Hezekiah had exceeding
much riches and honour: and he
made himself treasuries for silver,
and for gold, and for precious stones,
and for spices, and for shields, and
for all manner of a pleasant jewels;
28 Storehouses also for the increase of a corn, and wine, and oil;
and stalls for all manner of beasts,
and cotes for flocks.
29 Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and
herds in abundance: for God had
given him substance very much.
30 This same Hezekiah also stopped
the upper a watercourse of b Gihon,
and brought it straight down to the
west side of the city of David. And
Hezekiah prospered in all his works.

the ambassadors of the princes of

in the land, God left him, to a try
him, that he might know all that

of Isaiah the prophet, the son of

of Judah and Israel.

fathers, and they buried him in
the chiefest of the sepulchres of the
sons of David: and all Judah and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem did him
honour at his death. And Manasseh
his son reigned in his stead.
Chapter 33
Manasseh reigns in wickedness and
worships false gods—He is taken captive
into Assyria—He repents and serves the
Lord—Amon reigns in unrighteousness
and is slain.
Manasseh was twelve years old
when he began to reign, and he
reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:
2 But did that which was evil in
the sight of the Lord, like unto the
abominations of the heathen, whom
the Lord had cast out before the
children of Israel.
3 ¶ For he built again the a high
places which Hezekiah his father
had broken down, and he reared
up altars for b Baalim, and made
c 
groves, and worshipped all the host
of heaven, and served them.
4 Also he built altars in the house
of the Lord, whereof the Lord had
said, In Jerusalem shall my name
be for ever.
5 And he built altars for all the
host of heaven in the two courts of
the house of the Lord.
6 And he caused his children to
pass through the a fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he
b 
observed times, and used enchantments, and used c witchcraft, and
d 
dealt with a e familiar spirit, and
with wizards: he wrought much evil
in the sight of the Lord, to provoke
him to anger.

David and to Solomon his son, In
this house, and in Jerusalem, which
I have chosen before all the tribes of
Israel, will I put my name for ever:
8 Neither will I any more remove
the foot of Israel from out of the land
which I have appointed for your
fathers; so that they will take heed
to do all that I have commanded
them, according to the whole law
and the statutes and the ordinances
by the hand of Moses.
9 So Manasseh made Judah and
the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err,
and to do a worse than the b heathen,
whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel.
10 And the Lord spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they
would not a hearken.
11 ¶ Wherefore the Lord brought
upon them the captains of the host
of the king of Assyria, which took
Manasseh a among the thorns, and
bound him with fetters, and carried
him to Babylon.
12 And when he was in a affliction,
he b besought the Lord his God, and
c 
humbled himself greatly before
the God of his fathers,
13 And prayed unto him: and he
was a entreated of him, and heard
his supplication, and brought him
again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then b Manasseh knew that
the Lord he was God.
14 Now after this he built a wall
without the city of David, on the
west side of Gihon, in the valley,
even to the entering in at the fish
a 
gate, and compassed about Ophel,
and raised it up a very great height,
and put captains of war in all the
b 
fenced cities of Judah.
15 And he took away the strange
gods, and the idol out of the house
of the Lord, and all the altars that
he had built in the mount of the
house of the Lord, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.

16 And he repaired the altar of

and commanded Judah to serve the

17 Nevertheless the people did
sacrifice still in the high places,
yet unto the Lord their God only.

before he was humbled: behold,
they are written among the a sayings
of the seers.
20 ¶ So Manasseh slept with his
fathers, and they buried him in
his own house: and Amon his son
reigned in his stead.
21 ¶ a Amon was two and twenty
years old when he began to reign,
and reigned two years in Jerusalem.
22 But he did that which was evil
in the sight of the Lord, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images
which Manasseh his father had
made, and served them;
23 And humbled not himself before the Lord, as Manasseh his
father had humbled himself; but
Amon trespassed more and more.
24 And his servants conspired
against him, and slew him in his
own house.
25 ¶ But the people of the land
slew all them that had conspired
against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son
king in his stead.

Chapter 34

Josiah destroys idolatry in Judah—
The people of Judah repair the house
of the Lord—Hilkiah finds a book of
the law—Huldah the prophetess reveals
the desolations to come upon the people—Josiah and the people covenant to
serve the Lord.
Josiah was eight years old when
he began to reign, and he reigned
in Jerusalem one and thirty years.
2 And he did that which was right
in the sight of the Lord, and walked
in the ways of David his father, and
declined neither to the right hand,
nor to the left.
3 ¶ For in the eighth year of his
reign, while he was yet young, he
began to a seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth
year he began to b purge Judah and
Jerusalem from the high places, and
the groves, and the carved images,
and the molten images.
4 And they brake down the altars
of Baalim in his presence; and the
a 
images, that were on high above
them, he cut down; and the groves,
and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and
made dust of them, and strowed it
upon the graves of them that had
sacrificed unto them.
5 And he a  burnt the bones of
the priests upon their altars, and
cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.
6 And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon,
even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.
7 And when he had broken down
the altars and the groves, and had
beaten the graven images into
powder, and cut down all the idols
throughout all the land of Israel, he
returned to Jerusalem.
8 ¶ Now in the eighteenth year
of his reign, when he had purged
the land, and the house, he sent
a 
Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and

or  sun images.

Maaseiah the governor of the city,
and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the
Lord his God.
9 And when they came to Hilkiah
the high priest, they delivered the
money that was brought into the
house of God, which the Levites
that kept the doors had gathered of
the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim,
and of all the remnant of Israel, and
of all Judah and Benjamin; and they
returned to Jerusalem.
10 And they put it in the hand of
the workmen that had the oversight
of the house of the Lord, and they
gave it to the workmen that wrought
in the house of the Lord, to repair
and amend the house:
11 Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone,
and timber for couplings, and to
floor the houses which the kings
of Judah had destroyed.
12 And the men did the work
faithfully: and the overseers of
them were Jahath and Obadiah,
the Levites, of the sons of Merari;
and Zechariah and Meshullam, of
the sons of the Kohathites, to set it
forward; and other of the Levites, all
that could skill of instruments of
musick.
13 Also they were over the bearers
of burdens, and were overseers of
all that wrought the work in any
manner of service: and of the Levites
there were a scribes, and officers, and
porters.
14 ¶ And when they brought out
the money that was brought into
the house of the Lord, Hilkiah the
priest found a book of the law of
the Lord given by Moses.
15 And Hilkiah answered and said
to Shaphan the scribe, I have found
the a book of the law in the house
of the Lord. And Hilkiah delivered
the book to Shaphan.
16 And Shaphan carried the book
to the king, and brought the king

word back again, saying, All that
was committed to thy servants,
they do it.
17 And they have gathered together the money that was found
in the house of the Lord, and have
delivered it into the hand of the
overseers, and to the hand of the
workmen.
18 Then Shaphan the scribe told
the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest
hath given me a book. And Shaphan
read it before the king.
19 And it came to pass, when the
king had heard the words of the
law, that he rent his clothes.
20 And the king commanded
Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of
Shaphan, and Abdon the son of
Micah, and Shaphan the scribe,
and Asaiah a servant of the king’s,
saying,
21 Go, inquire of the Lord for
me, and for them that are left in
Israel and in Judah, concerning the
words of the book that is found:
for great is the wrath of the Lord
that is poured out upon us, because
our fathers have not kept the word
of the Lord, to do after all that is
written in this a book.
22 And Hilkiah, and they that the
king had appointed, went to Huldah
the prophetess, the wife of Shallum
the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now
she dwelt in Jerusalem in the a college:) and they spake to her to that
effect.
23 ¶ And she answered them, Thus
saith the Lord God of Israel, Tell ye
the man that sent you to me,
24 Thus saith the Lord, Behold,
I will bring evil upon this place,
and upon the inhabitants thereof,
even all the a curses that are written
in the b book which they have read
before the king of Judah:
25 Because they have forsaken me,
and have burned incense unto other
gods, that they might provoke me
to anger with all the works of their
	21	a	 Deut. 6:6 (6–8);
1 Ne. 15:24 (23–24);

630
hands; therefore my wrath shall be
poured out upon this place, and
shall not be quenched.
26 And as for the king of Judah,
who sent you to inquire of the
Lord, so shall ye say unto him, Thus
saith the Lord God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast
heard;
27 Because thine heart was tender,
and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his
words against this place, and against
the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst
rend thy clothes, and weep before
me; I have even heard thee also,
saith the Lord.
28 Behold, I will gather thee to thy
fathers, and thou shalt be gathered
to thy grave in peace, neither shall
thine eyes see all the evil that I will
bring upon this place, and upon the
inhabitants of the same. So they
brought the king word again.
29 ¶ Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah
and Jerusalem.
30 And the king went up into the
house of the Lord, and all the men
of Judah, and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, and the priests, and the
Levites, and all the people, great and
small: and he a read in their ears all
the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house
of the Lord.
31 And the king stood in his place,
and made a a covenant before the
Lord, to b walk after the Lord, and
to keep his commandments, and his
testimonies, and his statutes, with
all his heart, and with all his soul, to
perform the words of the covenant
which are written in this book.
32 And he caused all that were
present in Jerusalem and Benjamin
to stand to it. And the inhabitants
of Jerusalem did according to the
covenant of God, the God of their
fathers.

abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children
of Israel, and made all that were
present in Israel to serve, even to
serve the Lord their God. And all
his days they departed not from following the Lord, the God of their
fathers.
Chapter 35
Josiah and all Judah keep a most solemn
Passover—Josiah is mortally wounded
by the Egyptians at Megiddo.
Moreover Josiah kept a a passover
unto the Lord in Jerusalem: and
they killed the passover on the
b 
fourteenth day of the first month.
2 And he set the priests in their
charges, and encouraged them to
the service of the house of the Lord,
3 And said unto the Levites that
a 
taught all Israel, which were holy
unto the Lord, Put the holy ark in
the house which Solomon the son
of David king of Israel did build;
it shall not be a burden upon your
shoulders: serve now the Lord your
God, and his people Israel,
4 And prepare yourselves by the
a 
houses of your fathers, after your
courses, b according to the c writing of
David king of Israel, and according
to the writing of Solomon his son.
5 And a stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fami­
lies of the fathers of your brethren
the people, and after the division of
the families of the Levites.
6 So kill the passover, and a sanctify yourselves, and b prepare your
brethren, that they may do according to the word of the Lord by the
hand of Moses.
7 And Josiah gave to the people,
of the flock, lambs and kids, all for
the passover offerings, for all that
were present, to the number of
thirty thousand, and three thousand

substance.
8 And his princes gave willingly
unto the people, to the priests, and
to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house
of God, gave unto the priests for the
passover offerings two thousand
and six hundred small cattle, and
three hundred oxen.
9 Conaniah also, and Shemaiah
and Nethaneel, his brethren, and
Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief
of the Levites, gave unto the Levites
for passover offerings five thousand
small cattle, and five hundred oxen.
10 So the service was prepared, and
the priests stood in their place, and
the Levites in their courses, according to the king’s commandment.
11 And they killed the passover,
and the a priests sprinkled the b blood
from their hands, and the Levites
c 
flayed them.
12 And they removed the burnt
offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the fami­
lies of the people, to offer unto the
Lord, as it is written in the book of
Moses. And so did they with the oxen.
13 And they roasted the passover
with fire according to the ordinance:
but the other holy offerings a sod they
in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans,
and divided them speedily among
all the people.
14 And afterward they made ready
for themselves, and for the priests:
because the priests the sons of Aaron
were busied in offering of burnt
offerings and the fat until night;
therefore the Levites prepared for
themselves, and for the priests the
sons of Aaron.
15 And the singers the sons of
Asaph were in their place, according

waited at every gate; they might
not depart from their service; for
their brethren the Levites prepared
for them.
16 So all the service of the Lord
was prepared the same day, to keep
the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the Lord,
according to the commandment of
king Josiah.
17 And the children of Israel that
were present kept the passover at
that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.
18 And there was no a passover
like to that kept in Israel from
the days of Samuel the prophet;
neither did all the kings of Israel
keep such a passover as Josiah kept,
and the priests, and the Levites,
and all Judah and Israel that were
present, and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem.
19 In the eighteenth year of the
reign of Josiah was this passover
kept.
20 ¶ After all this, when Josiah had
prepared the temple, Necho king
of Egypt came up to fight against
Carchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.
21 But he sent ambassadors to
him, saying, What have I to do with
thee, thou king of Judah? I come not
against thee this day, but against
the house wherewith I have war:
for God commanded me to make
haste: forbear thee from meddling
with God, who is with me, that he
destroy thee not.
22 Nevertheless a  Josiah would
not turn his face from him, but
disguised himself, that he might
fight with him, and hearkened not
unto the words of Necho from the
mouth of God, and came to fight
in the valley of Megiddo.
23 And the archers shot at king
Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore
wounded.
24 His servants therefore took him

out of that chariot, and put him in
the second chariot that he had; and
they brought him to Jerusalem, and
he died, and was buried in one of
the sepulchres of his fathers. And
all Judah and Jerusalem mourned
for Josiah.
25 ¶ And Jeremiah a lamented for
Josiah: and all the singing men and
the singing women spake of Josiah
in their lamentations to this day,
and made them an ordinance in
Israel: and, behold, they are written
in the lamentations.
26 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according
to that which was written in the law
of the Lord,
27 And his deeds, first and last,
behold, they are written in the book
of the kings of Israel and Judah.
Chapter 36
Various kings rule in Judah—Nebuchadnezzar overruns Judah and makes
Zedekiah king—Zedekiah rebels, the
people reject the prophets, and the Chaldeans burn the temple and destroy Jerusalem—Cyrus of Persia decrees the
building of the temple.
Then the people of the land took
a 
Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and
made him b king in his father’s stead
in Jerusalem.
2 Jehoahaz was twenty and three
years old when he began to reign,
and he reigned three months in
Jerusalem.
3 And the king of Egypt a put him
down at Jerusalem, and b condemned
the land in an hundred talents of
silver and a talent of gold.
4 And the king of Egypt made
Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his
name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took
Jehoahaz his brother, and carried
him to a Egypt.
5 ¶ a Jehoiakim was twenty and five

evil in the sight of the Lord his God.
6 Against him came up a Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and
bound him in b fetters, to carry him
to Babylon.
7 Nebuchadnezzar also carried
of the a vessels of the house of the
Lord to Babylon, and put them in
his temple at Babylon.
8 Now the rest of the acts of
a 
Jehoia­kim, and his abominations
which he did, and that which was
found in him, behold, they are
written in the book of the kings of
Israel and Judah: and b Jehoiachin
his son reigned in his stead.
9 ¶ Jehoiachin was a eight years
old when he began to reign, and
he reigned three months and ten
days in Jerusalem: and he did that
which was evil in the sight of the
Lord.
10 And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent,
and brought him to a Babylon, with
the goodly vessels of the house of
the Lord, and made b Zedekiah his
brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.
11 ¶ a Zedekiah was one and twenty

in the sight of the Lord his God,
and humbled not himself before

his heart from turning unto the

14 ¶ Moreover all the chief of the
priests, and the people, transgressed
very much after all the a abominations of the heathen; and polluted
the house of the Lord which he
had hallowed in Jerusalem.
15 And the Lord God of their
fathers a sent to them by his b messengers, rising up c betimes, and sending;
because he had compassion on his
people, and on his dwelling place:
16 But they a mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words,
and misused his b prophets, until
the wrath of the Lord arose against
his people, till there was no remedy.
17 Therefore he brought upon
them the king of the Chaldees, who
a 
slew their young men with the
sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon
young man or maiden, old man, or
him that stooped for age: he gave
them all into his hand.
18 And all the vessels of the house
of God, great and small, and the
treasures of the house of the Lord,
and the treasures of the king, and
of his princes; all these he brought
to Babylon.
19 And they burnt the house of
God, and brake down the wall of
a 
Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces
thereof with fire, and destroyed all
the goodly vessels thereof.
20 And them that had escaped
from the sword carried he away to

that were brought up from Babylon

64 ¶ The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand
three hundred and threescore,
65 Beside their servants and their
maids, of whom there were seven
thousand three hundred thirty and
seven: and there were among them
two hundred singing men and singing women.
66 Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules,
two hundred forty and five;
67 Their camels, four hundred
thirty and five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
68 ¶ And some of the chief of the
fathers, when they came to the
a 
house of the Lord which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house
of God to set it up in his place:
69 They gave after their ability
unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of
gold, and five thousand pound of
silver, and one hundred priests’
garments.
70 So the priests, and the Levites,
and some of the people, and the
singers, and the porters, and the
Nethinims, dwelt in their cities,
and all Israel in their cities.
Chapter 3
The altar is rebuilt—Regular sacrifices
are reinstituted—The foundations of
the temple are laid amid great rejoicing.
And when the seventh month was
come, and the children of Israel were
in the cities, the people gathered
themselves together as one man to
Jerusalem.
2 Then stood up Jeshua the son
of Jozadak, and his brethren the
priests, and Zerubbabel the son of
Shealtiel, and his brethren, and
builded the altar of the God of Israel,
to offer burnt a offerings thereon,
	 63	b	 tg  Urim and Thummim.
	68	a	 Ps. 122:1;
Mosiah 1:18;
D&C 88:137.
3	2	a	 Deut. 12:6 (5–6);

as it is written in the law of Moses
the b man of God.
3 And they set the altar upon
his bases; for fear was upon them
because of the people of those
countries: and they offered burnt
offerings thereon unto the Lord,
even burnt offerings morning and
evening.
4 They kept also the a feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered
the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the
duty of every day required;
5 And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the
new moons, and of all the set a feasts
of the Lord that were consecrated,
and of every one that b willingly offered a freewill offering unto the
Lord.
6 From the first day of the seventh
month began they to offer burnt
offerings unto the Lord. But the
foundation of the temple of the
Lord was not yet laid.
7 They gave money also unto the
masons, and to the carpenters; and
meat, and drink, and oil, unto them
of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to
bring a cedar trees from Lebanon to
the sea of Joppa, according to the
grant that they had of b Cyrus king
of Persia.
8 ¶ Now in the second year of their
coming unto the house of God at
Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel,
and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and
the remnant of their brethren the
priests and the Levites, and all they
that were come out of the captivity
unto Jerusalem; and appointed the
Levites, from twenty years old and
upward, to set forward the work of
the house of the Lord.
9 Then stood Jeshua with his sons
and his brethren, Kadmiel and his
sons, the sons of Judah, together,
to set forward the workmen in the

house of God: the sons of Henadad,
with their sons and their brethren
the Levites.
10 And when the builders laid
the foundation of the temple of the
Lord, they set the priests in their
apparel with trumpets, and the
Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the Lord, after the
ordinance of David king of Israel.
11 And they sang together by
course in praising and giving
a 
thanks unto the Lord; because
he is b good, for his mercy endureth
for ever toward Israel. And all the
people shouted with a great shout,
when they c praised the Lord, because the foundation of the house
of the Lord was laid.
12 But many of the priests and
Levites and chief of the fathers, who
were a ancient men, that had seen the
first house, when the foundation
of this house was laid before their
eyes, b wept with a loud voice; and
many shouted aloud for joy:
13 So that the people could not
discern the noise of the shout of joy
from the noise of the weeping of
the people: for the people shouted
with a loud shout, and the noise
was heard afar off.
Chapter 4
The Samaritans offer help, then hinder
the work—The building of the temple
and of the walls of Jerusalem ceases.
Now when the a  adversaries of
Judah and Benjamin heard that the
children of the captivity builded
the temple unto the Lord God of
Israel;
2 Then they came to Zerubbabel,
and to the chief of the fathers, and
said unto them, Let us build with
you: for we seek your God, as ye do;
and we do sacrifice unto him since

3 But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and
the rest of the chief of the fathers of
Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house
unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the Lord God
of Israel, as a king Cyrus the king of
Persia hath commanded us.
4 Then the people of the land
a 
weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in
building,
5 And hired counsellors against
them, to frustrate their purpose,
all the days of Cyrus king of Persia,
even until the reign of a Darius king
of Persia.
6 And in the reign of a Ahasuerus,
in the beginning of his reign, wrote
they unto him an accusation against
the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.

wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel,
and the rest of their companions,
unto Artaxerxes king of Persia;
and the writing of the letter was
written in the a Syrian tongue, and
interpreted in the Syrian tongue.
8 Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against
Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king
in this sort:

and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest
of their companions; the Dinaites,
the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites,
the Apharsites, the Archevites, the
Babylonians, the Susanchites, the

cities of Samaria, and the rest that
are a on this side the river, and at such

11 ¶ This is the copy of the letter
that they sent unto him, even unto
Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants
the men on this side the river, and
at such a time.
12 Be it known unto the king, that
the Jews which came up from thee to
us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city,
and have set up the walls thereof,
and joined the foundations.
13 Be it known now unto the king,
that, if this city be builded, and the
walls set up again, then will they not
pay toll, tribute, and custom, and
so thou shalt endamage the revenue
of the kings.
14 Now because a we have maintenance from the king’s palace, and it
was not meet for us to see the king’s
dishonour, therefore have we sent
and certified the king;
15 That search may be made in the
a 
book of the records of thy fathers:
so shalt thou find in the b book of
the records, and know that this city
is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto
kings and provinces, and that they
have moved sedition within the
same of old time: for which cause
was this city destroyed.
16 We certify the king that, if this
city be builded again, and the walls
thereof set up, by this means thou
shalt have no portion on this side
the river.
17 ¶ Then sent the king an answer
unto Rehum the chancellor, and to
Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest
of their companions that dwell in
Samaria, and unto the rest beyond
the river, Peace, and at such a time.
18 The letter which ye sent unto us
hath been plainly read before me.
19 And I commanded, and search
hath been made, and it is found that
this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that
rebellion and sedition have been
made therein.

21 Give ye now commandment to
cause these men to a cease, and that
this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given
from me.
22 Take heed now that ye fail not
to do this: why should damage grow
to the hurt of the kings?
23 ¶ Now when the copy of king
Artaxerxes’ letter was read before
Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe,
and their companions, they went
up in haste to Jerusalem unto the
Jews, and made them to cease by
force and power.
24 Then ceased the work of the
house of God which is at Jerusalem.
So it ceased unto the second year of
the reign of Darius king of Persia.
Chapter 5
Haggai and Zechariah prophesy—Zerubbabel renews the building of the temple—
The Samaritans challenge the Jews’
right to continue their building work.
Then the a prophets, b Haggai the
prophet, and c Zechariah the son
of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews
that were in Judah and Jerusalem
in the name of the God of Israel,
even unto them.
2 Then rose up Zerubbabel the
son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son
of Jozadak, and began to build the
house of God which is at Jerusalem:
and with them were the prophets of
God helping them.
3 ¶ At the same time came to them
Tatnai, governor a on this side the
river, and Shethar-boznai, and their
companions, and said thus unto
them, Who hath commanded you
to build this house, and to make

4 Then said we unto them after
this manner, What are the names of
the men that make this building?
5 But the eye of their God was
upon the elders of the Jews, that
they could not cause them to cease,
till the matter came to Darius: and
then they returned answer by letter
concerning this matter.
6 ¶ The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river,
and Shethar-boznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, which
were on this side the river, sent unto
Darius the king:
7 They sent a letter unto him,
wherein was written thus; Unto
Darius the king, all peace.
8 Be it known unto the a king, that
we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God,
which is builded with great stones,
and timber is laid in the walls, and
this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands.
9 Then asked we those elders, and
said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house,
and to make up these walls?
10 We asked their names also, to
certify thee, that we might write
the names of the men that were the
chief of them.
11 And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of
the God of heaven and earth, and
build the house that was builded
these many years ago, which a great
king of Israel builded and set up.
12 But after that our fathers had
provoked the God of heaven unto
wrath, he gave them into the hand
of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed
this house, and carried the people
away into Babylon.
13 But in the first year of Cyrus
the king of Babylon the same king
a 
Cyrus made a decree to build this
house of God.
14 And the vessels also of gold and
silver of the house of God, which
Nebuchadnezzar took out of the

temple that was in Jerusalem, and
brought them into the temple of
Babylon, those did Cyrus the king
take out of the temple of Babylon,
and they were delivered unto one,
whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom
he had made governor;
15 And said unto him, Take these
vessels, go, carry them into the temple
that is in Jerusalem, and let the house
of God be builded in his place.
16 Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the
house of God which is in Jerusalem:
and since that time even until now
hath it been in building, and yet it
is not finished.
17 Now therefore, if it seem good to
the king, let there be search made
in the king’s treasure house, which
is there at Babylon, whether it be
so, that a decree was made of Cyrus
the king to build this house of God
at Jerusalem, and let the king send
his pleasure to us concerning this
matter.
Chapter 6
Darius renews the decree of Cyrus to
build the temple—It is finished and
dedicated, and sacrifices and feasts
commence again.
Then Darius the king made a decree,
and search was made in the house
of the a rolls, where the treasures
were laid up in Babylon.
2 And there was found at Achmetha,
in the palace that is in the province
of the Medes, a a roll, and therein
was a record thus written:
3 In the first year of Cyrus the king
the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at
Jerusalem, Let the a house be builded,
the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof
be strongly laid; the height thereof
threescore cubits, and the breadth
thereof threescore cubits;
4 With three rows of great stones,
and a row of new timber: and let
the expenses be given out of the
king’s house:

5 And also let the golden and silver
vessels of the house of God, which
Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of
the temple which is at Jerusalem,
and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the
temple which is at Jerusalem, every
one to his place, and place them in
the house of God.
6 Now therefore, Tatnai, governor
a 
beyond the river, Shethar-boznai,
and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river,
be ye far from thence:
7 Let the work of this house of God
alone; let the governor of the Jews
and the elders of the Jews build this
house of God in his place.
8 Moreover I make a decree what
ye shall do to the elders of these
Jews for the building of this house
of God: that of the king’s goods,
even of the tribute beyond the
river, forthwith expenses be given
unto these men, that they be not
hindered.
9 And that which they have need
of, both young bullocks, and rams,
and lambs, for the burnt offerings
of the God of heaven, wheat, salt,
wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are
at Jerusalem, let it be given them
day by day without fail:
10 That they may offer a sacrifices
of sweet savours unto the God of
heaven, and b pray for the life of
the king, and of his sons.
11 Also I have made a decree, that
whosoever shall alter this word, let
timber be pulled down from his
house, and being set up, let him be
hanged thereon; and let his house
be made a dunghill for this.

and their companions, according
to that which Darius the king had
sent, so they did speedily.
14 And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the
prophesying of a Haggai the prophet
and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And
they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God
of Israel, and according to the commandment of b Cyrus, and Darius,
and Artaxerxes king of Persia.
15 And this house was finished on
the third day of the month a Adar,
which was in the sixth year of the
reign of Darius the king.
16 ¶ And the children of Israel,
the priests, and the Levites, and the
rest of the children of the captivity,
kept the a dedication of this house
of God with joy,
17 And offered at the dedication
of this house of God an hundred
bullocks, two hundred rams, four

Chapter 7
Ezra goes up to Jerusalem—Artaxerxes
provides for beautifying the temple and
sustains the Jews in their worship.
Now after these things, in the reign
of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra
the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of a Hilkiah,
2 The son of Shallum, the son of
Zadok, the son of Ahitub,
3 The son of Amariah, the son of
Azariah, the son of Meraioth,
4 The son of Zerahiah, the son of
Uzzi, the son of Bukki,
5 The son of Abishua, the son of
Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the
son of Aaron the chief priest:
6 This Ezra went up from Bab­
ylon; and he was a ready a scribe in
the law of Moses, which the Lord
God of Israel had given: and the
king granted him all his request,
according to the b hand of the Lord
his God upon him.
7 And there went up some of the
children of Israel, and of the priests,
and the Levites, and the singers, and
the porters, and the Nethinims, unto
Jerusalem, in the seventh year of
Artaxerxes the king.
8 And he came to Jerusalem in
the fifth month, which was in the
seventh year of the king.

first month began he to go up from
Babylon, and on the first day of the
fifth month came he to Jerusalem,

10 For Ezra had a prepared his
b 
heart to seek the law of the Lord,
and to do it, and to teach in Israel
c 
statutes and judgments.
11 ¶ Now this is the copy of the
letter that the king Artaxerxes gave
unto Ezra the priest, the scribe,
even a a scribe of the words of the
commandments of the Lord, and
of his statutes to Israel.
12 Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto
Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law
of the God of heaven, perfect peace,
and at such a time.
13 I make a decree, that all they of
the people of Israel, and of  his priests
and Levites, in my realm, which are
minded of their own freewill to go
up to Jerusalem, go with thee.
14 Forasmuch as thou art sent of
the king, and of his seven counsellors, to inquire concerning Judah
and Jerusalem, according to the law
of thy God which is in thine hand;
15 And to carry the silver and
gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the
God of Israel, whose habitation is
in Jerusalem,
16 And all the silver and gold that
thou canst find in all the province
of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests,
offering willingly for the house of
their God which is in Jerusalem:
17 That thou mayest buy speedily
with this money bullocks, rams,
lambs, with their meat offerings
and their drink offerings, and offer
them upon the altar of the house
of your God which is in Jerusalem.
18 And whatsoever shall seem
good to thee, and to thy brethren,
to do with the rest of the a silver
and the gold, that do after the will
of your God.

20 And whatsoever more shall be
needful for the house of thy God,
which thou shalt have occasion to
bestow, bestow it out of the king’s

21 And I, even I Artaxerxes the
king, do make a decree to all
the treasurers which are beyond
the river, that whatsoever Ezra the
priest, the scribe of the law of the
God of heaven, shall require of you,
it be done speedily,

silver, and to an hundred measures

23 Whatsoever is commanded by
the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the
God of heaven: for why should there
be wrath against the realm of the
king and his sons?
24 Also we a certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites,
singers, porters, b  Nethinims, or
ministers of this house of God, it
shall not be lawful to impose toll,
tribute, or custom, upon them.
25 And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine
hand, set magistrates and a judges,
which may judge all the people
that are b beyond the river, all such
as know the c laws of thy God; and
d 
teach ye them that know them
not.
26 And whosoever will not do the
law of thy God, and the law of the
king, let judgment be executed
speedily upon him, whether it be
unto a death, or to banishment, or
to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.

Those who go up from Babylon to Jerusalem are listed—The Levites are called
to accompany them—Ezra and the people fast and pray for and gain guidance

10 And of the sons of Shelomith;
the son of Josiphiah, and with him
an hundred and threescore males.
11 And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him

them threescore males.
14 Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai,
and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.
15 ¶ And I gathered them together
to the river that runneth to Ahava;
and there abode we in tents three
days: and I viewed the people, and
the priests, and found there none
of the sons of Levi.
16 Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan,
and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and
for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and
for a Meshullam, chief men; also for
Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of
understanding.
17 And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at
the place Casiphia, and I told them
what they should say unto Iddo,
and to his brethren the Nethinims,
at the place Casiphia, that they
should bring unto us ministers for
the house of our God.
18 And by the good a hand of our
God upon us they brought us a
man of understanding, of the sons
of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of
Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons
and his brethren, eighteen;
19 And Hashabiah, and with him
Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his
brethren and their sons, twenty;

David and the princes had appointed for the service of the
Levites, two hundred and twenty
Nethi­nims: all of them were expressed by name.
21 ¶ Then I proclaimed a a fast
there, at the river of Ahava, that
we might b afflict ourselves before
our God, to seek of him a right way
for us, and for our little ones, and
for all our substance.
22 For I was ashamed to require
of the king a band of soldiers and
horsemen to help us against the
enemy in the way: because we had
spoken unto the king, saying, The
hand of our God is upon all them for
a 
good that b seek him; but his power
and his wrath is against all them
that forsake him.
23 So we a fasted and besought
our God for this: and he was b entreated of us.
24 ¶ Then I a separated twelve of
the chief of the priests, Sherebiah,
Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,
25 And weighed unto them the
silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house
of our God, which the king, and
his counsellors, and his lords, and
all Israel there present, had offered:
26 I even weighed unto their hand
six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred
talents, and of gold an hundred
talents;
27 Also twenty basins of gold, of
a thousand drams; and two vessels
of a fine copper, precious as gold.
28 And I said unto them, Ye are
holy unto the Lord; the vessels are
holy also; and the silver and the
gold are a freewill offering unto the
Lord God of your fathers.

ye weigh them before the chief of the

the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem,
in the chambers of the house of
the Lord.
30 So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the
gold, and the vessels, to bring them to
Jerusalem unto the house of our God.
31 ¶ Then we departed from the
river of Ahava on the twelfth day
of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God
was upon us, and he delivered us
from the hand of the enemy, and
of such as lay in wait by the way.
32 And we came to Jerusalem, and
abode there three days.
33 ¶ Now on the fourth day was the
silver and the gold and the vessels
weighed in the house of our God
by the hand of Meremoth the son
of Uriah the priest; and with him
was Eleazar the son of Phinehas;
and with them was Jozabad the son
of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of
Binnui, Levites;
34 By number and by weight of
every one: and all the weight was
written at that time.
35 Also the children of those that
had been carried away, which were
come out of the captivity, offered
burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel,
ninety and six rams, seventy and
seven lambs, twelve he goats for a
sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the Lord.
36 ¶ And they delivered the king’s
commissions unto the king’s lieutenants, and to the governors a on this
side the river: and they b furthered
the people, and the house of God.

the a princes came to me, saying, The

of the lands, doing according to
their c abominations, even of the
Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites,

2 For they have taken of their
a 
daughters for themselves, and for

have mingled themselves with the
people of those lands: yea, the hand
of the princes and rulers hath been
chief in this trespass.
3 And when I heard this thing, I
a 
rent my garment and my mantle,
and plucked off the hair of my head
and of my beard, and sat down astonied.
4 Then were assembled unto me
every one that a trembled at the
words of the God of Israel, because
of the transgression of those that
had been carried away; and I sat
astonied until the evening sacrifice.
5 ¶ And at the evening sacrifice I
arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle,
I fell upon my knees, and spread out
my hands unto the Lord my God,
6 And said, O my God, I am ashamed
and blush to lift up my face to thee,
my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens.
7 Since the days of our fathers have
we been in a great trespass unto this
day; and for our iniquities have we,
our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of
the lands, to the sword, to captivity,
and to a spoil, and to a confusion of
face, as it is this day.

hath been shewed from the Lord our

place, that our God may c lighten
our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
9 For we were bondmen; yet our
God hath not forsaken us in our
a 
bondage, but hath extended mercy
unto us in the sight of the kings
of Persia, to give us a reviving, to
set up the house of our God, and
to repair the desolations thereof,
and to give us a wall in Judah and
in Jerusalem.
10 And now, O our God, what shall
we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,
11 Which thou hast commanded
by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to
possess it, is an unclean land with
the a filthiness of the people of the
lands, with their abominations,
which have filled it from one end
to another with their uncleanness.
12 Now therefore give not your
daughters unto their sons, neither
take their daughters unto your sons,
nor seek their peace or their wealth
for ever: that ye may be strong, and
eat the good of the land, and leave
it for an inheritance to your children for ever.
13 And after all that is come upon
us for our a evil deeds, and for our
great trespass, seeing that thou
our God hast punished us less than
our b iniquities deserve, and hast
given us such deliverance as this;
14 Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity
with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry
with us till thou hadst consumed us,
so that there should be no remnant
nor escaping?
15 O Lord God of Israel, thou art
a 
righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we
are before thee in our trespasses:
for we cannot stand before thee
because of this.

The Jews covenant to put away their
wives taken from the Canaanites and
others—Ezra assembles the people at
Jerusalem—The Levites who married
non-Israelite women are listed.
Now when Ezra had prayed, and
when he had a confessed, weeping
and casting himself down before
the house of God, there assembled
unto him out of Israel a very great
congregation of men and women
and children: for the people wept
very sore.
2 And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel,
one of the sons of Elam, answered
and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have
taken a strange wives of the people
of the land: yet now there is hope
in Israel concerning this thing.
3 Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all
the wives, and such as are born of
them, according to the counsel of
my lord, and of those that tremble at
the commandment of our God; and
let it be done according to the law.
4 Arise; for this matter belongeth
unto thee: we also will be with thee:
be of good a courage, and do it.
5 Then arose Ezra, and made the
chief priests, the Levites, and all
Israel, to swear that they should
do according to this word. And
they sware.
6 ¶ Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went
into the chamber of Johanan the
son of Eliashib: and when he came
thither, he did eat no bread, nor
drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them
that had been carried away.
7 And they made proclamation
throughout Judah and Jerusalem
unto all the children of the captivity,
that they should gather themselves
together unto Jerusalem;
8 And that whosoever would not

come within three days, according
to the counsel of the princes and
the elders, all his substance should
be forfeited, and himself separated
from the congregation of those that
had been carried away.
9 ¶ Then all the men of Judah and
Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three
days. It was the ninth month, on the
twentieth day of the month; and all
the people sat in the street of the
house of God, trembling because of
this matter, and for the great rain.
10 And Ezra the priest stood up,
and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange
a 
wives, to increase the trespass of
Israel.
11 Now therefore make a confession
unto the Lord God of your fathers,
and do his pleasure: and b separate
yourselves from the people of the
land, and from the strange wives.
12 Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice,
As thou hast said, so must we a do.
13 But the people are many, and it
is a time of much rain, and we are
not able to stand without, neither
is this a work of one day or two: for
we are many that have transgressed
in this thing.
14 Let now our rulers of all the
congregation stand, and let all them
which have taken strange wives in
our cities come at appointed times,
and with them the elders of every
city, and the judges thereof, until
the fierce wrath of our God for this
matter be turned from us.
15 ¶ Only Jonathan the son of Asa­
hel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah
a 
were employed about this matter:
and Meshullam and Shabbethai
the Levite helped them.
16 And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with
certain chief of the fathers, after
the house of their fathers, and all
of them by their names, were sepa­
rated, and sat down in the first day

matter.
17 And they made an end with
all the men that had taken strange
wives by the first day of the first
month.

priests there were found that had
taken strange wives: namely, of the
sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak,
and his brethren; Maaseiah, and
Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.

they would put away their wives;

Chapter 2
Artaxerxes sends Nehemiah to Jerusalem—Sanballat and others oppose
Nehemiah in rebuilding the walls and
gates of Jerusalem.
And it came to pass in the month
Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine,
and gave it unto the king. Now I
had not been beforetime sad in his
presence.
2 Wherefore the king said unto
me, Why is thy countenance sad,
seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I
was very sore afraid,
3 And said unto the king, Let the
king live for ever: why should not
my countenance be a sad, when the
city, the place of my fathers’ sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates
thereof are consumed with fire?

1 Ne. 22:12 (10–12);
2 Ne. 21:12 (11–16);

4 Then the king said unto me, For
what dost thou make request? So I
prayed to the God of heaven.
5 And I said unto the king, If it
please the king, and if thy servant
have found favour in thy sight, that
thou wouldest send me unto Judah,
unto the city of my fathers’ sepulchres, that I may build it.
6 And the king said unto me, (the
queen also sitting by him,) For how
long shall thy journey be? and when
wilt thou return? So it pleased the
king to send me; and I set him a time.
7 Moreover I said unto the king,
If it please the king, let letters be
given me to the governors a beyond
the river, that they may convey me
over till I come into Judah;
8 And a letter unto Asaph the
keeper of the king’s forest, that he
may give me timber to make beams
for the gates of the palace which
appertained to the house, and for the
wall of the city, and for the house
that I shall enter into. And the king
granted me, according to the good
hand of my God upon me.
9 ¶ Then I came to the governors
beyond the river, and gave them
the king’s letters. Now the king
had sent captains of the army and
horsemen with me.
10 When a Sanballat the Horonite,
and b Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them
exceedingly that there was come a
man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.
11 So I came to Jerusalem, and was
there three days.
12 ¶ And I arose in the night, I and
some few men with me; neither told
I any man what my God had put in
my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither
was there any beast with me, save
the beast that I rode upon.

of Jerusalem, which were broken
down, and the gates thereof were
consumed with fire.
14 Then I went on to the a gate of
the fountain, and to the king’s pool:
but there was no place for the beast
that was under me to pass.
15 Then went I up in the night by
the brook, and viewed the wall, and
turned back, and entered by the
gate of the valley, and so returned.
16 And the rulers knew not whither
I went, or what I did; neither had
I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to
the priests, nor to the nobles, nor
to the rulers, nor to the rest that
did the work.
17 ¶ Then said I unto them, Ye
see the distress that we are in, how
Jerusalem lieth a  waste, and the
gates thereof are burned with fire:
come, and let us build up the wall
of Jerusalem, that we be no more
a reproach.
18 Then I told them of the hand
of my God which was good upon
me; as also the king’s words that
he had spoken unto me. And they
said, Let us rise up and build. So
they strengthened their hands for
this good work.
19 But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian,
heard it, they a laughed us to b scorn,
and despised us, and said, What is
this thing that ye do? will ye rebel
against the king?

unto them, The God of heaven, he

Chapter 4
The Jews’ enemies seek to prevent them
from rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem—
Nehemiah arms the laborers and keeps
the work progressing.
But it came to pass, that when a Sanballat heard that we builded the
wall, he was wroth, and took great
indignation, and mocked the Jews.
2 And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and
said, What do these feeble Jews?
will they fortify themselves? will
they sacrifice? will they make an
end in a day ? will they revive the
stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?
3 Now Tobiah the Ammonite was
by him, and he said, Even that which
they build, if a fox go up, he shall
even break down their stone wall.
4 Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon
their own head, and give them for
a prey in the land of captivity:
5 And cover not their iniquity, and
let not their sin be blotted out from
before thee: for they have provoked
thee to anger before the builders.

6 So built we the wall; and all the
wall was joined together unto the
half thereof: for the a people had a
mind to b work.
7 ¶ But it came to pass, that when
a 
Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the
Ashdodites, heard that the walls of
Jerusalem were made up, and that
the breaches began to be stopped,
then they were very wroth,
8 And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against
Jerusalem, and to hinder it.
9 Nevertheless we made our prayer
unto our God, and set a watch
against them day and night, because of them.
10 And Judah said, The strength of
the bearers of burdens is decayed,
and there is much rubbish; so that
we are not able to build the wall.
11 And our adversaries said, They
shall not know, neither see, till we
come in the midst among them,
and slay them, and cause the work
to cease.
12 And it came to pass, that when
the Jews which dwelt by them came,
they said unto us ten times, From
all places whence ye shall return
unto us they will be upon you.
13 ¶ Therefore set I in the lower
places behind the wall, and on
the higher places, I even set the
people after their families with
their swords, their spears, and their
bows.
14 And I looked, and rose up, and
said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be
not ye a afraid of them: remember
the Lord, which is great and b terrible, and c fight for your brethren,
your sons, and your daughters, your
d 
wives, and your houses.
15 And it came to pass, when our
enemies heard that it was known
unto us, and God had brought their
a 
counsel to nought, that we returned

all of us to the wall, every one unto
his work.
16 And it came to pass from that
time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the
other half of them held both the
spears, the shields, and the bows,
and the a habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of
Judah.
17 They which builded on the
wall, and they that bare burdens,
with those that laded, every one
with one of his hands wrought in
the work, and with the other hand
held a weapon.
18 For the builders, every one had
his sword girded by his side, and so
builded. And he that sounded the
trumpet was by me.
19 ¶ And I said unto the nobles,
and to the rulers, and to the rest of
the people, The work is great and
large, and we are separated upon
the wall, one far from another.
20 In what place therefore ye hear
the sound of the trumpet, resort
ye thither unto us: our God shall
fight for us.
21 So we laboured in the work:
and half of them held the spears
from the rising of the morning till
the stars appeared.
22 Likewise at the same time said
I unto the people, Let every one
with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may
be a guard to us, and labour on the
day.
23 So neither I, nor my brethren,
nor my servants, nor the men of the
guard which followed me, none of
us put off our clothes, saving that
every one put them off for washing.
Chapter 5
Many Jews are in bondage to their
fellow Jews—At Nehemiah’s direction
they are freed, their lands are restored,
and the taking of usury is discontinued.
And there was a great cry of the

people and of their wives against
their brethren the Jews.
2 For there were that said, We, our
sons, and our daughters, are many:
therefore we take up corn for them,
that we may eat, and live.
3 Some also there were that said,
We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might
buy corn, because of the a dearth.
4 There were also that said, We
have a borrowed money for the king’s
tribute, and that upon our lands and
vineyards.
5 Yet now our flesh is as the flesh
of our brethren, our children as
their children: and, lo, we bring into
bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our
daughters are brought unto bondage
already: neither is it in our power
to redeem them; for other men have
our lands and vineyards.
6 ¶ And I was very angry when
I heard their cry and these words.
7 Then I consulted with myself,
and I rebuked the nobles, and the
rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact
a 
usury, every one of his brother. And
I set a great assembly against them.
8 And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our
brethren the Jews, which were sold
unto the heathen; and will ye even
sell your brethren? or shall they be
sold unto us? Then held they their
peace, and found nothing to answer.
9 Also I said, It is not good that ye
do: ought ye not to a walk in the fear
of our God because of the reproach
of the b heathen our enemies?
10 I likewise, and my brethren, and
my servants, might exact of them
money and corn: I pray you, let us
leave off this usury.
11 Restore, I pray you, to them,
even this day, their lands, their
vineyards, their oliveyards, and
their houses, also a the hundredth

12 Then said they, We will restore
them, and will require nothing of
them; so will we do as thou sayest.
Then I called the priests, and took
an oath of them, that they should
do according to this promise.
13 Also I shook my lap, and said,
So God shake out every man from
his house, and from his labour,
that performeth not this promise,
even thus be he shaken out, and
emptied. And all the congregation
said, Amen, and praised the Lord.
And the people did according to
this promise.
14 ¶ Moreover from the time that
I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the
twentieth year even unto the two
and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the
king, that is, twelve years, I and my
brethren a have not eaten the b bread
of the governor.
15 But the former governors that
had been before me a were chargeable
unto the people, and had taken of
them bread and wine, beside forty
shekels of silver; yea, even their
servants bare b rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the
c 
fear of God.
16 Yea, also I continued in the
work of this wall, neither bought
we any land: and all my servants
were gathered thither unto the work.
17 Moreover there were at my table
an hundred and fifty of the Jews
and rulers, beside those that came
unto us from among the heathen
that are about us.
18 Now that which was prepared
for me daily was one ox and six
choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days
store of all sorts of wine: yet for all
this required not I the bread of the
governor, because the bondage was
heavy upon this people.

Sanballat engages in intrigue against
Nehemiah and the building of the
wall—The Jews finish the construction
of the wall.
Now it came to pass, when a Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the
Arabian, and the rest of our enemies,
heard that I had builded the wall,
and that there was no breach left
therein; (though at that time I had
not set up the doors upon the gates;)
2 That Sanballat and Geshem sent
unto me, saying, Come, let us meet
together in some one of the villages in
the plain of Ono. But they thought
to do me a mischief.
3 And I sent messengers unto
them, saying, I am doing a great
work, so that I cannot come down:
why should the work cease, whilst
I leave it, and come down to you?
4 Yet they sent unto me four times
after this sort; and I answered them
after the same manner.
5 Then sent Sanballat his servant
unto me in like manner the fifth
time with an open letter in his hand;
6 Wherein was written, It is reported
among the heathen, and a Gashmu
saith it, that thou and the Jews think
to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be

prophets to preach of thee at Jeru­

Judah: and now shall it be reported
to the king according to these words.
Come now therefore, and let us take

There are no such things done as
thou sayest, but thou a feignest them
out of thine own heart.

Nehemiah 6:10–7:7

10 Afterward I came unto the
house of Shemaiah the son of Del­
aiah the son of Mehetabeel, who
was shut up; and he said, Let us
meet together in the house of God,
within the temple, and let us shut
the doors of the temple: for they
will come to slay thee; yea, in the
night will they come to slay thee.
11 And I said, Should such a man as
I flee? and who is a there, that, being
as I am, would go into the temple to
save his life? I will not go in.
12 And, lo, I perceived that God
had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against
me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had
hired him.
13 Therefore was he hired, that I
should be a afraid, and do so, and
sin, and that they might have matter
for an b evil report, that they might
reproach me.
14 My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to
these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the
prophets, that would have put me
in fear.
15 ¶ So the wall was finished in
the twenty and fifth day of the month
a 
Elul, in fifty and two days.
16 And it came to pass, that when
all our a enemies heard thereof, and
all the heathen that were about us
saw these things, they were much
cast down in their own eyes: for
they perceived that this work was
wrought of our God.
17 ¶ Moreover in those days the
nobles of Judah sent many letters
unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.
18 For there were many in Judah
sworn unto him, because he was the

Provision is made to protect Jerusalem—The genealogy is given of the Jews
who returned from Babylon—Priests
without genealogical records are denied
the priesthood.
Now it came to pass, when the wall
was built, and I had set up the doors,
and the porters and the singers and
the Levites were appointed,
2 That I gave my brother a Hanani,
and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he
was a b faithful man, and c feared
God above many.
3 And I said unto them, Let not
the gates of Jerusalem be opened
until the sun be hot; and while they
stand by, let them shut the doors,
and bar them: and appoint watches
of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one
to be over against his house.
4 Now the city was large and great:
but the people were few therein, and
the houses were not builded.
5 ¶ And my God put into mine
heart to gather together the nobles,
and the rulers, and the people, that
they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a a register of the
b 
genealogy of them which came
up at the first, and found written
therein,
6 These are the a children of the
province, that went up out of
the b captivity, of those that had
been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon
had carried away, and came again
to Jerusalem and to Judah, every

61 And these were they which went
up also from Tel-melah, Tel-haresha,

they could not shew their father’s

took one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife, and was
called after their name.
64 These sought their register

therefore were they, as b polluted,
put from the c priesthood.
65 And the a Tirshatha said unto
them, that they should not eat of
the most holy things, till there
stood up a priest with b Urim and
Thummim.
66 ¶ The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand
three hundred and threescore,
67 Beside their manservants and
their maidservants, of whom there
were seven thousand three hundred
thirty and seven: and they had two
hundred forty and five singing men
and singing women.
68 Their horses, seven hundred
thirty and six: their mules, two
hundred forty and five:
69 Their camels, four hundred
thirty and five: six thousand seven
hundred and twenty asses.
70 ¶ And some of the chief of the
fathers a gave unto the work. The
Tirshatha gave to the treasure a
thousand drams of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priests’
garments.
71 And some of the chief of the
fathers gave to the treasure of the
work twenty thousand drams of
gold, and two thousand and two
hundred pound of silver.
72 And that which the rest of the
people gave was twenty thousand
drams of gold, and two thousand
pound of silver, and threescore and
seven priests’ garments.
73 So the priests, and the Levites,
and the porters, and the singers,
and some of the people, and the
Nethinims, and all Israel, dwelt in
their cities; and when the seventh
month came, the children of Israel
were in their cities.

658

And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the
street that was before the a water
gate; and they spake unto b Ezra
the c scribe to bring the book of the
law of Moses, which the Lord had
commanded to Israel.
2 And Ezra the priest brought the
a 
law before the congregation both of
men and women, and all that could
hear with understanding, upon the
first day of the seventh month.
3 And he read therein before the
street that was before the water gate
from the morning until midday,
before the men and the women,
and those that could understand;
and the ears of all the people were
attentive unto the a book of the law.
4 And Ezra the scribe stood upon
a a pulpit of wood, which they had
made for the purpose; and beside
him stood Mattithiah, and Shema,
and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right
hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and
Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
5 And Ezra opened the book in the
sight of all the people; (for he was
above all the people;) and when he
opened it, all the people stood up:
6 And Ezra blessed the Lord,
the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with
lifting up their hands: and they
bowed their heads, and worshipped
the Lord with their faces to the
ground.
7 Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai,
Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and
the Levites, caused the people to

stood in their place.
8 So they read in the book in the
a 
law of God b distinctly, and c gave
the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.
9 ¶ And Nehemiah, which is the
a 
Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the
scribe, and the Levites that b taught
the people, said unto all the people,
This day is holy unto the Lord your
God; c mourn not, nor weep. For all
the people d wept, when they heard
the words of the law.
10 Then he said unto them, Go
your way, eat the fat, and drink the
sweet, and send a portions unto them
for whom nothing is prepared: for
this b day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye c sorry; for the joy of the
Lord is your d strength.
11 So the Levites stilled all the
people, saying, Hold your peace,
for the day is holy; neither be ye
grieved.
12 And all the people went their
way to eat, and to drink, and to send
portions, and to make great a mirth,
because they had b understood the
words that were declared unto them.
13 ¶ And on the second day were
gathered together the chief of
the fathers of all the people, the
priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra
the scribe, even to a understand the
words of the law.
14 And they found written in
the law which the Lord had commanded by Moses, that a the children
of Israel should dwell in booths in
the b feast of the seventh month:
15 And that they should publish
and proclaim in all their cities, and
in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto
the mount, and fetch olive branches,

and pine branches, and myrtle

booths, as it is written.
16 ¶ So the people went forth, and
brought them, and made themselves
booths, every one upon the roof
of his house, and in their courts,
and in the courts of the house of
God, and in the street of the water
gate, and in the street of the gate
of a Ephraim.
17 And all the congregation of
them that were come again out of
the captivity made a booths, and sat
under the booths: for since the days
of b Jeshua the son of c Nun unto that
day had not the children of Israel
done so. And there was very great
gladness.
18 Also day by day, from the first
day unto the last day, he a read in

5 Then the Levites, Jeshua, and

say, to his seed, and hast performed

our fathers in Egypt, and heardest
their cry by the b Red sea;
10 And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his
servants, and on all the people of
his land: for thou knewest that they
dealt proudly against them. So

before them, so that they went
through the midst of the sea on the
dry land; and their persecutors thou
threwest into the deeps, as a b stone
into the mighty waters.
12 Moreover thou leddest them in
the day by a cloudy a pillar; and
in the night by a pillar of fire, to
give them light in the way wherein
they should go.
13 Thou camest down also upon
mount Sinai, and spakest with them
from heaven, and gavest them right
judgments, and true laws, good
a 
statutes and commandments:
14 And madest known unto them
thy holy a sabbath, and commandedst
them precepts, statutes, and laws,
by the hand of Moses thy servant:
15 And gavest them a bread from
heaven for their hunger, and
brought­est forth b water for them
out of the rock for their thirst, and
promisedst them that they should go
in to c possess the land which thou
hadst sworn to give them.
16 But they and our fathers dealt
proudly, and a hardened their necks,
and hearkened not to thy commandments,
17 And refused to obey, neither
were mindful of thy wonders that
thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to
a 
return to their bondage: but thou
art a God ready to b pardon, gracious
and c merciful, slow to d anger, and
of great e kindness, and forsookest
them not.

wilderness: the pillar of the cloud
departed not from them by day, to
lead them in the way; neither the
pillar of fire by night, to shew them
light, and the way wherein they
should go.
20 Thou gavest also thy good
a 
spirit to b instruct them, and withheldest not thy c manna from their
mouth, and gavest them water for
their thirst.
21 Yea, forty years didst thou sustain
them in the wilderness, so that they
lacked nothing; their clothes waxed
not old, and their feet swelled not.
22 Moreover thou gavest them
kingdoms and nations, and didst
divide them into corners: so they
possessed the land of Sihon, and
the land of the king of Heshbon,
and the land of Og king of Bashan.
23 Their children also a  multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven,
and broughtest them into the land,
concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should
go in to possess it.
24 So the children went in and
possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants
of the land, the Canaanites, and
gavest them into their hands, with
their kings, and the people of the
land, that they might do with them
as they would.
25 And they took strong cities, and
a a fat land, and possessed houses
full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit
trees in abundance: so they did eat,
and were filled, and became fat, and
delighted themselves in thy great
goodness.

26 Nevertheless they were a disobedient, and b rebelled against thee,
and cast thy law behind their backs,
and c slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them
to thee, and they wrought great
provocations.
27 Therefore thou deliveredst them
into the hand of their a enemies,
who b vexed them: and in the time
of their c trouble, when they cried
unto thee, thou heardest them from
heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them d saviours, who saved them out of the
hand of their enemies.
28 But after they had rest, they
did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the hand
of their enemies, so that they had
the dominion over them: yet when
they returned, and cried unto thee,
thou heardest them from heaven;
and many times didst thou deliver
them according to thy mercies;
29 And testifiedst against them,
that thou mightest bring them again
unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly,
and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy
judgments, (which if a man do, he
shall live in them;) and withdrew
the shoulder, and hardened their
neck, and would not hear.
30 Yet many years didst thou a forbear them, and b testifiedst against
them by thy c spirit in thy d prophets:
yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand
of the people of the lands.
31 Nevertheless for thy great mercies’ sake thou didst not utterly
consume them, nor forsake them;
for thou art a gracious and a merciful God.

and mercy, let not all the trouble
seem little before thee, that hath
come upon us, on our kings, on our
princes, and on our priests, and on
our prophets, and on our fathers, and
on all thy people, since the time of
the kings of Assyria unto this day.
33 Howbeit thou art a just in all
that is brought upon us; for thou
hast done right, but we have done
b 
wickedly:
34 Neither have our kings, our
princes, our priests, nor our fathers,
kept thy law, nor hearkened unto
thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.
35 For they have not served thee
in their kingdom, and in thy great

in the large and fat land which thou
gavest before them, neither turned
they from their wicked works.

thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it:

unto the kings whom thou hast set
over us because of our sins: also they
have dominion over our bodies, and
over our cattle, at their pleasure,
and we are in great distress.
38 And because of all this we make
a sure covenant, and write it; and
our princes, Levites, and priests,
seal unto it.

Chapter 11
The people and their overseers are
elected by lot to dwell in Jerusalem and
the other cities.
And the rulers of the people dwelt
at Jerusalem: the rest of the people
also cast lots, to bring one of ten to
dwell in Jerusalem the a holy b city,
and nine parts to dwell in other cities.
2 And the people blessed all the
men, that willingly offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem.
3 ¶ Now these are the chief of the
province that dwelt in Jerusalem:
but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their
cities, to wit, Israel, the priests, and
the Levites, and the a Nethinims, and
the children of Solomon’s servants.
4 And at Jerusalem dwelt certain
of the children of Judah, and of the
children of Benjamin. Of the children of Judah; Athaiah the son of

11 Seraiah the son of Hilkiah,

the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph,
was the principal to begin the
thanksgiving in prayer: and Bakbukiah the second among his brethren, and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of
Jeduthun.
18 All the Levites in the holy city
were two hundred fourscore and four.
19 Moreover the porters, Akkub,
Talmon, and their brethren that
kept the gates, were an hundred
seventy and two.
20 ¶ And the residue of Israel, of
the priests, and the Levites, were in
all the cities of Judah, every one in
his inheritance.
21 But the Nethinims dwelt in
Ophel: and Ziha and Gispa were
over the Nethinims.
22 The a overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son
of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the
son of Mattaniah, the son of Micha.
Of the sons of Asaph, the singers
were over the business of the house
of God.
23 For it was the king’s commandment concerning them, that a certain portion should be for the singers, due for every day.
24 And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel, of the children of a Zerah
the son of Judah, was at the king’s
hand in all matters concerning the
people.
25 And for the villages, with their
fields, some of the children of Judah
dwelt at Kirjath-arba, and in the
villages thereof, and at Dibon, and

thereof, at Azekah, and in the villages thereof. And they dwelt from
Beer-sheba unto the valley of Hinnom.
31 The children also of Benjamin
from Geba dwelt at Michmash, and
Aija, and Beth-el, and in their villages,
32 And at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,
33 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,
34 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,
35 Lod, and Ono, the valley of
craftsmen.
36 And of the Levites were divisions
in Judah, and in Benjamin.
Chapter 12
The priests and Levites who came up
from Babylon are named—The walls of
Jerusalem are dedicated—The offices
of priests and Levites are appointed in
the temple.
Now these are the a priests and the
Levites that went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua:
Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
2 Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
3 Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,
4 Iddo, Ginnetho, a Abijah,
5 Miamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,
6 Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah,
7 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah.
These were the chief of the priests
and of their brethren in the days
of Jeshua.
8 Moreover the Levites: Jeshua,
Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah,
and Mattaniah, which was over the
thanksgiving, he and his brethren.
9 Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their
brethren, were over against them in
the watches.
10 ¶ And Jeshua begat Joiakim,
Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and
Eliashib begat Joiada,
11 And Joiada begat Jonathan, and
Jonathan begat Jaddua.
12 And in the days of Joiakim were

22 ¶ The Levites in the days of
Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and
Jaddua, were recorded chief of the
fathers: also the priests, to the reign
of Darius the Persian.
23 The sons of Levi, the chief of the
fathers, were written in the book of
the chronicles, even until the days
of Johanan the son of Eliashib.
24 And the chief of the Levites:
Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua
the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and
to give a thanks, according to the
commandment of David the man
of God, ward over against ward.
25 Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub,
were porters keeping the ward at
the a thresholds of the gates.
26 These were in the days of Joiakim
the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah
the governor, and of Ezra the priest,
the scribe.
27 ¶ And at the dedication of the
wall of Jerusalem they sought the
Levites out of all their places, to
bring them to Jerusalem, to keep
the dedication with gladness, both
with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and
with harps.
28 And the sons of the singers

	25	a	 or  storehouses.
	30	a	 Num. 8:7 (7–14);

gathered themselves together, both
out of the plain country round about
Jerusalem, and from the villages of
Netophathi;
29 Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba
and Azmaveth: for the singers had
builded them villages round about
Jerusalem.
30 And the priests and the Levites
a 
purified themselves, and purified
the people, and the gates, and the
wall.
31 Then I brought up the princes
of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies of them
that gave thanks, whereof one went
on the right hand upon the wall
toward the a dung gate:
32 And after them went Hoshaiah,
and half of the princes of Judah,
33 And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
34 Judah, and Benjamin, and
Shem­aiah, and Jeremiah,
35 And certain of the priests’ sons
with trumpets; namely, Zechariah
the son of Jonathan, the son of  Shem­
aiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son
of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the
son of Asaph:
36 And his brethren, Shemaiah,
and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai,
Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with
the a musical instruments of David
the man of God, and Ezra the scribe
before them.
37 And at the a fountain gate, which
was over against them, they went
up by the stairs of the city of David,
at the going up of the wall, above
the house of David, even unto the
water gate eastward.
38 And the other company of them
that gave thanks went over against
them, and I after them, and the half
of the people upon the wall, from
beyond the tower of the furnaces
even unto the broad wall;
39 And from above the gate of
a 
Ephraim, and above the old gate,

and above the b fish gate, and the
tower of Hananeel, and the tower
of Meah, even unto the sheep gate:
and they stood still in the prison
gate.
40 So stood the two companies of
them that gave thanks in the house
of God, and I, and the half of the
rulers with me:
41 And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with
trumpets;
42 And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah,
and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam,
and Ezer. And the singers sang
loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.
43 Also that day they offered great
sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had
made them a rejoice with great joy:
the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem
was heard even afar off.
44 ¶ And at that time were some
appointed over the chambers for
the treasures, for the offerings,
for the firstfruits, and for the a tithes,
to gather into them out of the fields
of the cities the portions of the
law for the priests and Levites: for
Judah rejoiced for the priests and
for the Levites that waited.
45 And both the singers and the
porters kept the a ward of their
God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon
his son.
46 For in the days of David and
Asaph of old there were chief of the
singers, and songs of praise and
thanksgiving unto God.
47 And all Israel in the days of
Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the
singers and the porters, every day
his portion: and they sanctified
holy things unto the Levites; and
the Levites sanctified them unto the
children of Aaron.

Chapter 13
The Ammonites and Moabites are
denied a place in the congregation of
God—Tobiah is ejected from his dwelling place in the temple—Nehemiah corrects abuses and reinstitutes Sabbath
observance—Some Jews are rebuked
for marrying non-Israelite women and
defiling the priesthood.
On that day they read in the a book
of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written,
that the b Ammonite and the Moabite
should not come into the congregation of God for ever;
2 Because they met not the children
of Israel with bread and with water,
but hired a Balaam against them, that
he should curse them: howbeit our
God turned the curse into a blessing.
3 Now it came to pass, when they
had heard the law, that they sepa­
rated from Israel all the a mixed
multitude.
4 ¶ And before this, Eliashib the
priest, having the oversight of the
chamber of the house of our God,
was allied unto Tobiah:
5 And he had prepared for him
a great chamber, where aforetime
they laid the meat offerings, the
frankincense, and the vessels, and
the tithes of the corn, the new wine,
and the oil, which was commanded
to be given to the Levites, and the
singers, and the porters; and the
offerings of the priests.
6 But in all this time was not I at
Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of
Babylon came I unto the king, and
after certain days obtained I leave
of the king:
7 And I came to Jerusalem, and
understood of the evil that Eliashib
did for Tobiah, in preparing him a
chamber in the courts of the house
of God.
8 And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household
stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.

9 Then I commanded, and they
cleansed the chambers: and thither
brought I again the vessels of the
house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense.
10 ¶ And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been
given them: for the Levites and the
singers, that did the work, were fled
every one to his field.
11 Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of
God forsaken? And I gathered them
together, and set them in their place.
12 Then brought all Judah the
a 
tithe of the corn and the new wine
and the oil unto the b treasuries.
13 And I made treasurers over the
treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and
Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was
Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of
Mattaniah: for they were counted
faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren.
14 Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my
good deeds that I have done for
the house of my God, and for the
offices thereof.
15 ¶ In those days saw I in Judah
some treading wine presses on the
a 
sabbath, and bringing in sheaves,
and lading asses; as also wine,
grapes, and figs, and all manner of
burdens, which they brought into
Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and
I testified against them in the day
wherein they sold b victuals.
16 There dwelt men of Tyre also
therein, which brought fish, and
all manner of ware, and sold on
the sabbath unto the children of
Judah, and in Jerusalem.
17 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them,
What evil thing is this that ye do,
and profane the sabbath day ?
18 Did not your fathers thus, and
did not our God bring all this evil
upon us, and upon this city ? yet

ye bring more wrath upon Israel
by profaning the sabbath.
19 And it came to pass, that when
the gates of Jerusalem began to be
dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be
shut, and charged that they should
not be opened till after the sabbath:
and some of my servants set I at the
gates, that there should no burden
be brought in on the sabbath day.
20 So the merchants and sellers
of all kind of ware lodged a without
Jerusalem once or twice.
21 Then I testified against them,
and said unto them, Why lodge ye
about the wall? if ye do so again, I
will lay hands on you. From that
time forth came they no more on
the sabbath.
22 And I commanded the Levites
that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come
and keep the gates, to sanctify the
sabbath day. Remember me, O my
God, concerning this also, and spare
me according to the greatness of
thy mercy.
23 ¶ In those days also saw I Jews
that had married wives of Ashdod,
of Ammon, and of Moab:
24 And their children spake half
in the speech of Ashdod, and could
not speak in the Jews’ a language,
but according to the language of
each people.
25 And I contended with them, and
cursed them, and smote certain of
them, and plucked off their hair, and
made them swear by God, saying, Ye
shall not a give your daughters unto
b 
their sons, nor take their daughters
unto your sons, or for yourselves.
26 Did not a Solomon king of Israel
sin by these things? yet among many
nations was there no king like him,
who was beloved of his God, and
God made him king over all Israel:
nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.

Ahasuerus of Persia and Media makes
royal feasts—Vashti disobeys the king
and is deposed as queen.
ow it came to pass in the
days of a Ahasuerus, (this is
Ahasuerus which reigned,
from India even unto Ethiopia, over
an hundred and seven and twenty
b 
provinces:)
2 That in those days, when the king
Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his
kingdom, which was in a Shushan
the palace,
3 In the third year of his reign, he
made a a feast unto all his princes
and his servants; the power of Persia
and Media, the nobles and princes
of the provinces, being before him:
4 When he shewed the a riches of
his glorious kingdom and the honour
of his excellent majesty many days,
even an hundred and fourscore days.
5 And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto

all the people that were present in
Shushan the palace, both unto great
and small, seven days, in the court
of the a garden of the king’s palace;
6 Where were white, green, and
blue, hangings, fastened with cords
of fine linen and purple to silver
rings and pillars of marble: the
beds were of gold and silver, upon
a pavement of red, and blue, and
white, and black, marble.
7 And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal
wine in abundance, according to
the state of the king.
8 And the a drinking was according to the law; none did compel:
for so the king had appointed to
all the officers of his house, that
they should do according to every
man’s b pleasure.
9 Also Vashti the queen made a
feast for the women in the royal
house which belonged to king Ahas­
uerus.

Esther 1:10–2:3

10 ¶ On the seventh day, when
the heart of the king was merry
with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, a Harbona, Bigtha, and
Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the
seven chamberlains that served
in the presence of Ahasuerus the
king,
11 To bring Vashti the queen before
the king with the crown royal, to
shew the people and the princes her
beauty: for she was fair to look on.
12 But the queen Vashti refused to
come at the king’s commandment
by his chamberlains: therefore was
the king very a wroth, and his anger
burned in him.
13 ¶ Then the king said to the a wise
men, which knew the b times, (for
so was the king’s manner toward
all that knew law and judgment:
14 And the next unto him was
Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Me­
mucan, the seven princes of Persia
and Media, which saw the king’s
face, and which sat the first in the
kingdom;)
15 What shall we do unto the queen
Vashti according to law, because
she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus
by the chamberlains?
16 And Memucan answered before
the king and the princes, Vashti the
queen hath not done wrong to the
king only, but also to all the princes,
and to all the people that are in all
the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.
17 For this deed of the queen shall
come abroad unto all women, so
that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall
be reported, The king Ahasuerus
commanded Vashti the queen to
be brought in before him, but she
came not.
18 Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all
the king’s princes, which have heard
of the deed of the queen. Thus shall
	10	a	 Esth. 7:9.
	12	a	 Mosiah 17:3;

	13	a	 Jer. 10:7.

there arise too much contempt and
wrath.
19 If it please the king, let there
go a royal commandment from him,
and let it be written among the
laws of the Persians and the Medes,
that it be not a altered, That Vashti
come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal
estate unto another that is better
than she.
20 And when the king’s decree
which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire,
(for it is great,) all the a wives shall
give to their husbands honour, both
to great and small.
21 And the saying pleased the king
and the princes; and the king did
according to the word of Memucan:
22 For he sent letters into all the
king’s provinces, into every province
according to the writing thereof,
and to every people after their a language, that every man should bear
b 
rule in his own house, and that it
should be published according to
the language of every people.
Chapter 2
Ahasuerus seeks a new queen—Mordecai presents Esther—Esther pleases the
king and is chosen as queen—Mordecai
exposes a plot against the king.
After these things, when the wrath
of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he
remembered Vashti, and what she
had done, and what was decreed
against her.
2 Then said the king’s servants
that ministered unto him, Let there
be fair young virgins sought for
the king:
3 And let the king appoint officers
in all the provinces of his kingdom,
that they may gather together all
the fair young virgins unto Shushan
the palace, to the house of the
women, unto the custody of Hege the
king’s chamberlain, keeper of the

women; and let their things for purification be given them:
4 And let the maiden which
pleaseth the king be queen instead
of Vashti. And the thing pleased the
king; and he did so.
5 ¶ Now in Shushan the palace
there was a certain Jew, whose
name was Mordecai, the son of Jair,
the son of Shimei, the son of Kish,
a Benjamite;
6 Who had been a carried away
from b Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away
with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom
Nebuchadnezzar the king of Bab­
ylon had carried away.
7 And he brought up Hadassah,
that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter: for she had neither father nor
mother, and the maid was fair and
beautiful; whom Mordecai, when
her father and mother were dead,
took for his own daughter.
8 ¶ So it came to pass, when the
king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many
maidens were gathered together
unto Shushan the palace, to the
custody of Hegai, that Esther was
brought also unto the king’s house,
to the custody of Hegai, keeper of
the women.
9 And the maiden pleased him, and
she obtained kindness of him;
and he speedily gave her her things
for purification, with such things as
belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her,
out of the king’s house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the
best place of the house of the women.
10 Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai
had a charged her that she should
not shew it.
11 And Mordecai walked every
day before the court of the women’s
house, to know how Esther did, and
what should become of her.
12 ¶ Now when every maid’s turn
was come to go in to king Ahasuerus,
2	6	a	 2 Kgs. 24:14 (14–15).
		b	 1 Ne. 10:3;
2 Ne. 6:8;

after that she had been twelve
months, according to the manner of
the women, (for so were the days of
their a purifications accomplished,
to wit, six months with oil of myrrh,
and six months with sweet odours,
and with other things for the purifying of the women;)
13 Then thus came every maiden
unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her
out of the house of the women unto
the king’s house.
14 In the evening she went, and
on the morrow she returned into
the second house of the women, to
the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s
chamberlain, which kept the a concubines: she came in unto the king
no more, except the king delighted
in her, and that she were called
by name.
15 ¶ Now when the turn of Esther,
the a daughter of Abihail the uncle
of Mordecai, who had taken her
for his daughter, was come to go in
unto the king, she required nothing
but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women,
appointed. And Esther obtained
favour in the sight of all them that
looked upon her.
16 So Esther was taken unto king
Ahasuerus into his house royal
in the tenth month, which is the
month Tebeth, in the seventh year
of his reign.
17 And the king loved Esther above
all the women, and she obtained
grace and favour in his sight more
than all the virgins; so that he set
the royal crown upon her head, and
made her queen instead of Vashti.
18 Then the king made a great
feast unto all his princes and his
servants, even Esther’s feast; and he
made a release to the provinces, and
gave gifts, according to the state of
the king.
19 And when the virgins were
gathered together the second time,
then Mordecai sat in the king’s gate.

Esther 2:20–3:12

20 Esther had not yet shewed her
kindred nor her people; as Mordecai
had charged her: for Esther did the
commandment of Mordecai, like as
when she was brought up with him.
21 ¶ In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the
king’s chamberlains, a Bigthan and
Teresh, of those which kept the
door, were wroth, and sought to
b 
lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.
22 And the thing was known to
a 
Mordecai, who told it unto Esther
the queen; and Esther certified the
king thereof in Mordecai’s name.
23 And when inquisition was made
of the matter, it was found out;
therefore they were both hanged
on a tree: and it was written in
the a book of the chronicles before
the king.
Chapter 3
Mordecai, the Jew, refuses to bow to
Haman—Haman arranges a decree to
kill all the Jews in the kingdom.
After these things did king Ahas­
uerus a promote Haman the son of
b 
Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above
all the princes that were with him.
2 And all the king’s servants, that
were in the king’s gate, a bowed, and
reverenced Haman: for the king had
so commanded concerning him.
But Mordecai bowed not, nor did
him reverence.
3 Then the king’s servants, which
were in the king’s gate, said unto
Mordecai, Why transgressest thou
the king’s commandment?
4 Now it came to pass, when they
spake daily unto him, and he heark­
ened not unto them, that they told
Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s
matters would stand: for he had
told them that he was a Jew.
5 And when Haman saw that
Mordecai a bowed not, nor did him

reverence, then was Haman full of
wrath.
6 And he thought scorn to lay
hands on Mordecai alone; for they
had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought
to a destroy all the Jews that were
throughout the whole kingdom
of Ahasuerus, even the people of
Mordecai.
7 ¶ In the first month, that is, the
month Nisan, in the twelfth year of
king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that
is, the lot, before Haman from day
to day, and from month to month,
to the twelfth month, that is, the
month a Adar.
8 ¶ And Haman said unto king
Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed
among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws
are diverse from all people; neither
keep they the king’s laws: therefore it is not for the king’s profit to
suffer them.
9 If it please the king, let it be
written that they may be a destroyed:
and I will b pay ten thousand talents
of silver to the hands of those that
have the charge of the business, to
bring it into the king’s treasuries.
10 And the king took his a ring from
his hand, and gave it unto Haman
the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy.
11 And the king said unto Haman,
The silver is given to thee, the people
also, to do with them as it seemeth
good to thee.
12 Then were the king’s scribes
called on the thirteenth day of the
first month, and there was written
according to all that Haman had
commanded unto the king’s lieutenants, and to the governors that were
over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province
according to the writing thereof,
and to every people after their

language; in the a name of  king Ahas­
uerus was it written, and b sealed
with the king’s ring.
13 And the a letters were sent by
posts into all the king’s provinces,
to destroy, to b kill, and to cause to
perish, all Jews, both young and old,
little children and women, in c one
day, even upon the thirteenth day
of the twelfth month, which is the
month Adar, and to take the spoil
of them for a prey.
14 The copy of the writing for a
commandment to be given in every
province was published unto all
people, that they should be ready
against that day.
15 The posts went out, being hastened by the king’s commandment,
and the decree was given in Shushan
the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city
Shushan was perplexed.
Chapter 4
Mordecai and the Jews mourn and fast
because of the king’s decree—Esther, at
the peril of her life, prepares to go in
unto the king.
When Mordecai perceived all that
was done, Mordecai rent his clothes,
and put on sackcloth with ashes,
and went out into the midst of the
city, and cried with a loud and a
bitter cry;
2 And came even before the king’s
gate: for none might enter into the
king’s gate clothed with sackcloth.
3 And in every province, whithersoever the king’s commandment
and his decree came, there was great
mourning among the Jews, and
a 
fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and
ashes.
4 ¶ So Esther’s maids and her
chamberlains came and told it her.
Then was the queen exceedingly
grieved; and she sent raiment to
clothe Mordecai, and to take away

his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.
5 Then called Esther for Hatach,
one of the king’s chamberlains,
whom he had appointed to attend
upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it
was, and why it was.
6 So Hatach went forth to Mordecai
unto the street of the city, which
was before the king’s gate.
7 And Mordecai told him of all that
had happened unto him, and of the
sum of the money that Haman had
promised to a pay to the king’s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.
8 Also he gave him the copy of
the writing of the decree that was
given at Shushan to destroy them, to
shew it unto Esther, and to declare
it unto her, and to charge her that
she should go in unto the king, to
make supplication unto him, and
to make request before him for
her people.
9 And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
10 ¶ Again Esther spake unto
Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;
11 All the king’s servants, and
the people of the king’s provinces,
do know, that whosoever, whether
man or woman, shall come unto
the king into the inner a court, who
is not called, there is one law of his
to put him to b death, except such to
whom the king shall hold out the
golden c sceptre, that he may live:
but I have not been called to come
in unto the king these thirty days.
12 And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.
13 Then Mordecai commanded to
answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the
king’s house, more than all the Jews.
14 For if thou altogether holdest
thy peace at this time, then shall
there a enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another

place; but thou and thy father’s
house shall be destroyed: and who
knoweth whether thou art come to
the kingdom for such a b time as this?
15 ¶ Then Esther bade them return
Mordecai this answer,
16 Go, gather together all the Jews
that are present in Shushan, and
a 
fast ye for me, and neither eat nor
drink three days, night or day: I also
and my maidens will fast likewise;
and so will I go in unto the king,
which is not according to the law:
and if I perish, I perish.
17 So Mordecai went his way, and
did according to all that Esther had
commanded him.
Chapter 5
The king receives Esther—She invites
him and Haman to a banquet—Haman
plans to have Mordecai hanged.
Now it came to pass on the third
day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court
of the king’s house, over against the
king’s house: and the king sat upon
his royal throne in the royal house,
over against the gate of the house.
2 And it was so, when the king saw
Esther the queen standing in the
court, that she obtained favour in
his sight: and the king held out to
Esther the golden a sceptre that was
in his hand. So Esther drew near,
and touched the top of the sceptre.
3 Then said the king unto her,
What wilt thou, queen Esther? and
what is thy request? it shall be
even given thee to the a half of the
kingdom.
4 And Esther answered, If it seem
good unto the king, let the king and
Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.
5 Then the king said, Cause Haman
to make haste, that he may do as
Esther hath said. So the king and
Haman came to the banquet that
Esther had prepared.

at the banquet of wine, What is thy
a 
petition? and it shall be granted
thee: and what is thy request? even
to the half of the kingdom it shall
be performed.
7 Then answered Esther, and said,
My petition and my request is;
8 If I have found favour in the sight
of the king, and if it please the king
to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and
Haman come to the a banquet that
I shall prepare for them, and I will
do to morrow as the king hath said.
9 ¶ Then went Haman forth that
day joyful and with a glad heart:
but when Haman saw Mordecai in
the king’s gate, that he a stood not
up, nor moved for him, he was full
of indignation against Mordecai.
10 Nevertheless Haman refrained
himself: and when he came home,
he sent and called for his friends,
and Zeresh his wife.
11 And Haman told them of the
glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the
things wherein the king had a promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and
servants of the king.
12 Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come
in with the king unto the banquet
that she had prepared but myself;
and to morrow am I invited unto
her also with the king.
13 Yet all this availeth me nothing,
so long as I see Mordecai the Jew
sitting at the king’s gate.
14 ¶ Then said Zeresh his wife
and all his friends unto him, Let
a a gallows be made of fifty cubits
high, and to morrow b speak thou
unto the king that Mordecai may
be hanged thereon: then go thou
in merrily with the king unto the
banquet. And the thing pleased
Haman; and he caused the gallows
to be made.

Chapter 6
Mordecai receives great honors—Haman mourns and is counseled by his
wife.
On that night could not the king
sleep, and he commanded to bring
the book of  a records of the b chroni­
cles; and they were read before
the king.
2 And it was found written, that
Mordecai had told of a Bigthana and
Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who
sought to lay hand on the king
Ahasuerus.
3 And the king said, What honour
and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king’s
servants that ministered unto him,
There is nothing done for him.
4 ¶ And the king said, Who is in
the court? Now Haman was come
into the outward a court of the king’s
house, to b speak unto the king to
hang Mordecai on the gallows that
he had prepared for him.
5 And the king’s servants said unto
him, Behold, Haman standeth in
the court. And the king said, Let
him come in.
6 So Haman came in. And the
king said unto him, What shall be
done unto the man whom the king
delighteth to honour? Now Haman
thought in his heart, To whom
would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?
7 And Haman answered the king,
For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,
8 Let the royal apparel be brought
which the king useth to wear, and
the horse that the king rideth upon,
and the crown royal which is set
upon his head:
9 And let this apparel and horse be
delivered to the hand of one of the
king’s most noble princes, that they
may array the man withal whom
the king delighteth to honour, and
bring him on horseback through

the street of the city, and proclaim
before him, Thus shall it be done to
the man whom the king delighteth
to honour.
10 Then the king said to Haman,
Make haste, and take the apparel
and the horse, as thou hast said,
and do even so to Mordecai the
Jew, that sitteth at the king’s gate:
let nothing fail of all that thou hast
spoken.
11 Then took Haman the apparel
and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback
through the street of the city, and
proclaimed before him, Thus shall
it be done unto the man whom the
king delighteth to honour.
12 ¶ And Mordecai came again to
the king’s gate. But Haman hasted
to his house mourning, and having
his a head covered.
13 And Haman told Zeresh his wife
and all his friends every thing that
had befallen him. Then said his
wise men and Zeresh his wife unto
him, If Mordecai be of the seed of
the Jews, before whom thou hast
begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely
fall before him.
14 And while they were yet talking
with him, came the king’s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman
unto the a banquet that Esther had
prepared.
Chapter 7
Esther reveals Haman’s plot to destroy
the Jews—He is hanged on his own
gallows.
So the king and Haman came to
banquet with Esther the queen.
2 And the king said again unto
Esther on the second day at the
banquet of wine, What is thy a petition, queen Esther? and it shall
be granted thee: and what is thy
request? and it shall be performed,
even to the half of the kingdom.
3 Then Esther the queen answered

Esther 7:4–8:8

and said, If I have found favour in
thy sight, O king, and if it please
the king, let my life be given me
at my petition, and my people at
my request:
4 For we are a sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain,
and to perish. But if we had been
sold for bondmen and bondwomen,
I had held my tongue, b although
the enemy could not countervail
the king’s damage.
5 ¶ Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the
queen, Who is he, and where is he,
that durst presume in his heart to
do so?
6 And Esther said, The adversary
and enemy is this wicked Haman.
Then Haman was afraid before the
king and the queen.
7 ¶ And the king arising from the
banquet of wine in his wrath went
into the palace a garden: and Haman stood up to make request for
his life to Esther the queen; for he
saw that there was evil determined
against him by the king.
8 Then the king returned out of
the palace garden into the place of
the banquet of wine; and Haman
was fallen upon the bed whereon
Esther was. Then said the king, Will
he force the queen also before me
in the house? As the word went out
of the king’s mouth, they covered
Haman’s face.
9 And a Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the b gallows fifty cubits
high, which Haman had made for
c 
Mordecai, who had spoken good for
the king, standeth in the house of
Haman. Then the king said, d Hang
him thereon.
10 So they hanged Haman on the
a 
gallows that he had prepared for
Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath
pacified.

Chapter 8
Mordecai is honored and placed over
the house of Haman—Ahasuerus issues
a decree to preserve the Jews.
On that day did the king Ahasuerus
give the house of Haman the Jews’
enemy unto Esther the queen. And
Mordecai came before the king;
for Esther had told a what he was
unto her.
2 And the king took off his a ring,
which he had taken from Haman,
and gave it unto Mordecai. And
Esther set Mordecai over the house
of Haman.
3 ¶ And Esther spake yet again
before the king, and fell down at
his feet, and besought him with
tears to put away the mischief of
Haman the Agagite, and his a device
that he had devised against the
Jews.
4 Then the king held out the golden
a 
sceptre toward Esther. So Esther
arose, and stood before the king,
5 And said, If it please the king,
and if I have found favour in his
sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in
his eyes, let it be written to reverse
the letters devised by Haman the
son of Hammedatha the Agagite,
which he wrote to destroy the Jews
which are in all the king’s provinces:
6 For how can I endure to see the
evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the
destruction of my kindred?
7 ¶ Then the king Ahasuerus said
unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given
Esther the house of Haman, and
him they have hanged upon the
gallows, because he laid his hand
upon the Jews.
8 Write ye also for the Jews, as it
liketh you, in the king’s name, and
seal it with the king’s ring: for the

writing which is written in the

king’s ring, may no man a reverse.
9 Then were the king’s scribes
called at that time in the third
month, that is, the month Sivan, on
the three and twentieth day thereof;
and it was written according to all
that Mordecai commanded unto
the Jews, and to the lieutenants,
and the deputies and rulers of the
provinces which are from India
unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty
and seven provinces, unto every
province according to the writing
thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews
according to their writing, and according to their a language.
10 And he wrote in the king Ahas­
uerus’ a name, and sealed it with the
king’s ring, and sent b letters by posts
on horseback, and riders on mules,
camels, and young dromedaries:
11 Wherein the king granted the
Jews which were in every city to
a 
gather themselves together, and
to stand for their life, to destroy,
to slay, and to cause to perish, all
the power of the people and province that would assault them, both
little ones and women, and to take
the spoil of them for a prey,
12 Upon a one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely,
upon the thirteenth day of the
twelfth month, which is the month
Adar.
13 The copy of the writing for a
commandment to be given in every province was published unto all
people, and that the Jews should be
ready against that day to avenge
themselves on their enemies.
14 So the posts that rode upon
mules and camels went out, being
hastened and pressed on by the king’s
commandment. And the decree was
given at Shushan the palace.
15 ¶ And Mordecai went out from
the presence of the king in royal

a 
apparel of blue and white, and with
a great crown of gold, and with a
garment of fine linen and purple:
and the city of Shushan rejoiced
and was glad.
16 The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.
17 And in every province, and in
every city, whithersoever the king’s
commandment and his decree came,
the Jews had joy and gladness, a
feast and a good a day. And many
of the people of the land became
Jews; for the b fear of the Jews fell
upon them.

Chapter 9
The Jews slay their enemies, including
Haman’s ten sons—The Feast of Purim is instituted to commemorate their
deliverance and victory.
Now in the twelfth month, that is,
the month Adar, on the thirteenth
day of the same, when the king’s
a 
commandment and his decree drew
near to be put in execution, in the
day that the enemies of the Jews
hoped to have power over them,
(though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over
them that hated them;)
2 The Jews a gathered themselves
together in their cities throughout
all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought
their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the b fear of them
fell upon all people.
3 And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the
deputies, and officers of the king,
helped the Jews; because the fear
of Mordecai fell upon them.
4 For Mordecai was great in the
king’s house, and his fame went out
throughout all the provinces: for
this man Mordecai waxed greater
and greater.
5 Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword,

and slaughter, and destruction, and
did what they would unto those
that hated them.
6 And in Shushan the palace the
Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.
7 And Parshandatha, and Dalphon,
and Aspatha,
8 And Poratha, and Adalia, and
Aridatha,
9 And Parmashta, and Arisai, and
Aridai, and Vajezatha,
10 The ten sons of Haman the son
of Hammedatha, the enemy of the
Jews, slew they; but on the spoil
laid they not their hand.
11 On that day the number of those
that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.
12 ¶ And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain
and destroyed five hundred men in
Shushan the palace, and the ten sons
of Haman; what have they done in
the rest of the king’s provinces? now
what is thy a petition? and it shall
be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done.
13 Then said Esther, If it please
the king, let it be granted to the
Jews which are in Shushan to do
to morrow also according unto this
day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten
sons be hanged upon the gallows.
14 And the king commanded it
so to be done: and the decree was
given at Shushan; and they hanged
Haman’s ten sons.
15 For the Jews that were in Shu­
shan gathered themselves together
on the fourteenth day also of the
month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the
prey they laid not their hand.
16 But the other Jews that were
in the king’s provinces gathered
themselves together, and stood for
their lives, and had rest from their
enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they
laid not their hands on the prey,
17 On the thirteenth day of the
month Adar; and on the fourteenth
	12	a	 Esth. 7:2.
	19	a	 Esth. 8:17.

day of the same rested they, and
made it a day of feasting and gladness.
18 But the Jews that were at
Shushan assembled together on
the thirteenth day thereof, and on
the fourteenth thereof; and on the
fifteenth day of the same they rested,
and made it a day of feasting and
gladness.
19 Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled
towns, made the fourteenth day
of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good a day,
and of sending b portions one to
another.
20 ¶ And Mordecai wrote these
things, and sent letters unto all the
Jews that were in all the provinces
of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh
and far,
21 To stablish this among them,
that they should keep the fourteenth
day of the month Adar, and the
fifteenth day of the same, yearly,
22 As the days wherein the Jews
rested from their enemies, and
the month which was turned unto
them from sorrow to joy, and from
mourning into a good day: that they
should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to
the poor.
23 And the Jews undertook to do
as they had begun, and as Mordecai
had written unto them;
24 Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of
all the Jews, had a devised against
the Jews to destroy them, and had
cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume
them, and to destroy them;
25 But when Esther came before
the king, he commanded by letters
that his wicked device, which he
devised against the Jews, should
return upon his own head, and that
he and his sons should be hanged
on the gallows.
26 Wherefore they called these
days Purim after the name of Pur.

678

Therefore for all the words of this
letter, and of that which they had
seen concerning this matter, and
which had come unto them,
27 The Jews ordained, and took
upon them, and upon their seed,
and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not
fail, that they would keep these two
days according to their writing, and
according to their appointed time
every year;
28 And that these days should be
remembered and kept throughout
every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and
that these days of Purim should
not fail from among the Jews, nor
the memorial of them perish from
their seed.
29 Then Esther the queen, the
a 
daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai
the Jew, wrote with all authority, to
confirm this second b letter of Purim.
30 And he sent the letters unto all
the Jews, to the hundred twenty
and seven a provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of
peace and truth,
31 To confirm these days of Purim

in their times appointed, according
as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the
queen had enjoined them, and as
they had decreed for themselves
and for their seed, the matters of
the a fastings and their cry.
32 And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and
it was written in the book.
Chapter 10
Mordecai, the Jew, stands next to Aha­
suerus in power and might.
And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the
isles of the sea.
2 And all the acts of his power and
of his might, and the declaration of
the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king a advanced him, are
they not written in the book of the
b 
chronicles of the kings of Media
and Persia?
3 For Mordecai the a Jew was b next
unto king Ahasuerus, and great
among the Jews, and accepted of
the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and
speaking peace to all his seed.

upright, and one that e feared God,
and eschewed evil.
2 And there were born unto him
seven sons and three daughters.
3 His substance also was seven
thousand sheep, and three thousand
camels, and five hundred yoke of
oxen, and five hundred she asses,
and a very great household; so that
this man was the greatest of all the
men of the east.
4 And his a sons went and feasted
in their houses, every one his day;
and sent and called for their three
sisters to eat and to drink with
them.
5 And it was so, when the days of
their feasting were gone about, that
Job sent and sanctified them, and
rose up early in the morning, and
offered burnt a offerings according
to the number of them all: for Job
said, It may be that my b sons have
sinned, and c cursed God in their
hearts. Thus did Job continually.
6 ¶ Now there was a day when the
a 
sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and b Satan
came also among them.
7 And the Lord said unto Satan,
Whence comest thou? Then Satan
answered the Lord, and said, From

8 And the Lord said unto Satan,

and said, Doth Job fear God for

12 And the Lord said unto Satan,
Behold, all that he hath is in thy

power; only upon himself put not
forth thine hand. So Satan went
forth from the presence of the Lord.
13 ¶ And there was a day when his
sons and his daughters were eating
and drinking wine in their eldest
brother’s house:
14 And there came a messenger
unto Job, and said, The oxen were
plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:
15 And the Sabeans fell upon them,
and took them away; yea, they have
slain the servants with the edge of
the sword; and I only am escaped
alone to tell thee.
16 While he was yet speaking, there
came also another, and said, The
fire of God is fallen from heaven,
and hath burned up the sheep, and
the servants, and consumed them;
and I only am escaped alone to tell
thee.
17 While he was yet speaking, there
came also another, and said, The

and fell upon the camels, and have
carried them away, yea, and slain
the servants with the edge of the
sword; and I only am escaped alone
to tell thee.
18 While he was yet speaking,
there came also another, and said,
Thy a sons and thy daughters were

the four corners of the house, and it

20 Then Job arose, and a rent his
mantle, and shaved his head, and
fell down upon the ground, and
worshipped,
21 And said, a Naked came I out of

presence of the Lord, and smote
Job with a sore b boils from the sole
of his foot unto his crown.
8 And he took him a potsherd to
scrape himself withal; and he sat
down among the a ashes.
9 ¶ Then said his wife unto him,
Dost thou still a retain thine b integrity ? c curse God, and die.
10 But he said unto her, Thou
speakest as one of the foolish women
speaketh. What? shall we receive
a 
good at the hand of God, and shall
we not receive b evil? In all this did
not Job c sin with his lips.
11 ¶ Now when Job’s three a friends
heard of all this evil that was come
upon him, they came every one
from his own place; Eliphaz the
Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite,
and Zophar the Naamathite: for they
had made an appointment together
to come to mourn with him and to
comfort him.
12 And when they lifted up their
eyes afar off, and knew him not,
they lifted up their voice, and wept;
and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their
heads toward heaven.
13 So they sat down with him upon
the ground a seven days and seven
nights, and none spake a word unto
him: for they saw that his b grief was
very great.

After this opened Job his mouth,
and a cursed his day.
2 And Job spake, and said,
3 Let the day a perish wherein I was
b 
born, and the night in which it was
said, There is a man child conceived.
4 Let that day be darkness; let not
God regard it from above, neither
let the light shine upon it.
5 Let darkness and the a shadow
of death stain it; let a cloud dwell
upon it; let the blackness of the
day terrify it.
6 As for that night, let darkness
seize upon it; let it not be joined
unto the days of the year, let it not
come into the number of the months.
7 Lo, let that night be solitary, let
no joyful voice come therein.
8 Let them curse it that curse the
day, who are ready to raise up their
mourning.
9 Let the stars of the twilight
thereof be dark; let it look for light,
but have none; neither let it see the
dawning of the day:
10 Because it shut not up the doors
of my mother’s womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.
11 Why a died I not from the womb?
why did I not give up the ghost when
I came out of the belly ?
12 Why did the knees a prevent me?
or why the breasts that I should suck?
13 For now should I have lain still
and been quiet, I should have slept:
then had I been at rest,

the earth, a which built desolate
places for themselves;
15 Or with princes that had gold,
who filled their houses with silver:

I had not been; as infants which

22 Which rejoice exceedingly,
and are glad, when they can find
the grave?
23 Why is light given to a man whose
way is hid, and whom God hath
hedged in?
24 For my sighing cometh before
I eat, and my roarings are poured
out like the waters.
25 For the thing which I greatly
feared is come upon me, and that
which I was afraid of is come unto me.
26 I was not in safety, neither had
I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.

Eliphaz reproves Job, asking such questions as, Are the righteous cut off? Shall
a man be more pure than his maker?
Then a Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
2 If we assay to commune with thee,
wilt thou be grieved? but who can
withhold himself from speaking?
3 Behold, thou hast instructed
many, and thou hast strengthened
the weak hands.
4 Thy words have upholden him
that was falling, and thou hast
strengthened the feeble knees.
5 But now it is come upon thee,

thee, and thou art troubled.

7 Remember, I pray thee, who ever
perished, being a innocent? or where
were the righteous cut off?
8 Even as I have seen, they that
plow iniquity, and a sow wickedness,
reap the same.
9 By the blast of God they perish,
and by the breath of his nostrils are
they consumed.
10 The roaring of the lion, and
the voice of the fierce lion, and the
a 
teeth of the young lions, are broken.
11 The old lion perisheth for lack
of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps
are scattered abroad.
12 Now a thing was secretly
brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.
13 In thoughts from the visions of
the night, when deep sleep falleth
on men,
14 Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to
shake.
15 Then a spirit passed before my
face; the hair of my flesh stood up:
16 It stood still, but I could not
discern the form thereof: an image
was before mine eyes, there was a silence, and I heard a b voice, saying,
17 Shall mortal man be more a just
than God? shall a man be more pure
than his maker?
18 Behold, he put no trust in his
servants; and his angels he charged
with folly:
19 How much less in them that
dwell in houses of a clay, whose
foundation is in the dust, which are
crushed before the moth?
20 They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever
without any regarding it.
21 Doth not their excellency which
is in them go away ? they die, even
without wisdom.

up: he a woundeth, and his hands
make whole.
19 He shall deliver thee in six
troubles: yea, in seven there shall

21 Thou shalt be hid from the

thou be a afraid of destruction when

22 At destruction and famine thou
shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be

thou shalt visit thy habitation, and
shalt not sin.
25 Thou shalt know also that thy

26 Thou shalt come to thy grave in

10 Then should I yet have comfort;
yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not
concealed the words of the Holy One.

Is there not an a appointed time to

also like the days of an b hireling?
2 As a servant earnestly desireth
the shadow, and as an hireling
looketh for the reward of his work:
3 So am I made to possess months
of vanity, and wearisome nights are
appointed to me.
4 When I lie down, I say, When
shall I arise, and the night be gone?
and I am full of tossings to and fro
unto the dawning of the day.
5 My flesh is clothed with worms

Chapter 8

Bildad asks, Doth God pervert judgment?—Bildad says, Our days upon
earth are a shadow, and God will not
cast away a perfect man.
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite,
and said,
2 How long wilt thou speak these
things? and how long shall the words
of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
3 Doth God pervert a judgment? or
doth the Almighty pervert justice?
4 If thy children have sinned
against him, and he have cast them
away for their transgression;
5 If thou wouldest seek unto God
betimes, and make thy supplication
to the Almighty;
6 If thou wert pure and upright;
surely now he would awake for
thee, and make the habitation of
thy righteousness prosperous.
7 Though thy beginning was small,
yet thy latter end should greatly
increase.
8 For inquire, I pray thee, of the
former a age, and prepare thyself to
the search of their fathers:
9 (For we are but of yesterday, and
know nothing, because our a days
upon earth are a shadow:)
10 Shall not they teach thee, and
tell thee, and utter words out of
their heart?
11 Can the rush grow up without
mire? can the a flag grow without

12 Whilst it is yet in his greenness,
and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.
13 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite’s hope
shall perish:
14 Whose hope shall be cut off, and
whose trust shall be a spider’s web.
15 He shall lean upon his house,
but it shall not stand: he shall hold
it fast, but it shall not endure.

Job 20:10–21:14

10 His children shall seek to please
the poor, and his hands shall restore
their goods.
11 His bones are full of the a sin
of his youth, which shall lie down
with him in the dust.
12 Though wickedness be sweet in
his mouth, though he hide it under
his tongue;
13 Though he spare it, and forsake
it not; but keep it still within his
mouth:
14 Yet his meat in his bowels is
turned, it is the gall of asps within
him.
15 He hath swallowed down riches,
and he shall vomit them up again:
God shall cast them out of his belly.
16 He shall suck the poison of asps:
the viper’s tongue shall slay him.
17 He shall not see the rivers, the
floods, the brooks of honey and
butter.
18 That which he laboured for
shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and
he shall not rejoice therein.
19 Because he hath oppressed and
hath forsaken the poor; because he
hath violently taken away an house
which he builded not;
20 Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save
of that which he desired.
21 There shall none of his meat
be left; therefore shall no man look
for his goods.
22 In the fulness of his sufficiency
he shall be in straits: every hand of
the wicked shall come upon him.
23 When he is about to fill his
belly, God shall cast the fury of his
wrath upon him, and shall rain it
upon him while he is eating.
24 He shall flee from the iron
weapon, and the bow of steel shall
strike him through.
25 It is drawn, and cometh out of
the body; yea, the glittering sword
cometh out of his gall: terrors are
upon him.
26 All darkness shall be hid in his

secret places: a fire not blown shall
consume him; it shall go ill with
him that is left in his tabernacle.
27 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up
against him.
28 The increase of his house shall
depart, and his goods shall flow away
in the day of his wrath.
29 This is the portion of a wicked
man from God, and the heritage
appointed unto him by God.
Chapter 21
Job admits that the wicked sometimes
prosper in this life—Then he testifies
that their judgment will be hereafter in
the day of wrath and destruction.
But Job answered and said,
2 Hear diligently my speech, and
let this be your consolations.
3 Suffer me that I may speak; and
after that I have spoken, a mock on.
4 As for me, is my complaint to
man? and if it were so, why should
not my spirit be troubled?
5 Mark me, and be astonished, and
lay your a hand upon your mouth.
6 Even when I remember I am
afraid, and trembling taketh hold
on my flesh.
7 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are a mighty in power?
8 Their seed is established in their
sight with them, and their offspring
before their eyes.
9 Their houses are safe from fear,
neither is the rod of God upon them.
10 Their bull gendereth, and
faileth not; their cow calveth, and
casteth not her calf.
11 They send forth their little
ones like a flock, and their children dance.
12 They take the timbrel and harp,
and rejoice at the sound of the a organ.
13 They spend their days in wealth,
and in a moment go down to the
grave.
14 Therefore they say unto God,
Depart from us; for we desire not
the knowledge of thy ways.

15 What is the Almighty, that we
should serve him? and what profit
should we have, if we pray unto him?
16 Lo, their good is not in their
hand: the counsel of the wicked is
far from me.
17 How oft is the candle of the
wicked put out! and how oft cometh
their destruction upon them! God
distributeth sorrows in his anger.
18 They are as stubble before the
wind, and as a chaff that the storm
carrieth away.
19 God layeth up his iniquity for
his children: he a rewardeth him,
and he shall know it.
20 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall a drink of the
wrath of the Almighty.
21 For what pleasure hath he in
his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the
midst?
22 Shall any a teach God b knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that
are high.
23 One dieth in his full strength,
being wholly at ease and quiet.
24 His breasts are full of milk,
and his bones are moistened with
marrow.
25 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth
with pleasure.
26 They shall lie down alike in

cover them.
27 Behold, I know your thoughts,
and the devices which ye wrongfully
imagine against me.

of the prince? and where are the

go by the way ? and do ye not know

Eliphaz accuses Job of various sins and
exhorts him to repent.
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
2 Can a man be profitable unto
God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?
3 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty,
that thou art a righteous? or is it gain
to him, that thou makest thy ways
b 
perfect?
4 Will he reprove thee for fear of
thee? will he enter with thee into
judgment?
5 Is not thy wickedness great? and
thine iniquities infinite?
6 For thou hast taken a pledge
from thy brother for nought, and
stripped the naked of their clothing.
7 Thou hast not given water to the
weary to drink, and thou hast withholden a bread from the b hungry.
8 But as for the mighty man, he
had the earth; and the honourable
man dwelt in it.
9 Thou hast sent widows away
empty, and the arms of the a fatherless have been broken.
10 Therefore snares are round
about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;
11 Or darkness, that thou canst
not see; and abundance of waters
cover thee.

Job 22:12–23:12

12 Is not God in the height of
heaven? and behold the height of
the stars, how high they are!
13 And thou sayest, How doth God
a 
know? can he b judge through the
dark cloud?
14 Thick clouds are a covering
to him, that he seeth not; and he
walketh in the circuit of heaven.
15 Hast thou marked the old way
which wicked men have trodden?
16 Which were cut down out of
time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:
17 Which said unto God, Depart
from us: and what can the Almighty
do for them?
18 Yet he filled their houses with
good things: but the counsel of the
wicked is far from me.
19 The righteous see it, and are
glad: and the innocent laugh them
to scorn.
20 Whereas our substance is not
cut down, but the remnant of them
the fire consumeth.
21 Acquaint now thyself with a him,
and be at b peace: thereby good shall
come unto thee.
22 Receive, I pray thee, the law
from his mouth, and lay up his
words in thine heart.
23 If thou return to the Almighty,
thou shalt be a built up, thou shalt
put away iniquity far from thy
tabernacles.
24 Then shalt thou lay up gold as
dust, and the gold of Ophir as the
stones of the brooks.
25 Yea, the Almighty shall be thy
defence, and thou shalt have plenty
of silver.
26 For then shalt thou have thy
delight in the Almighty, and shalt
lift up thy a face unto God.
27 Thou shalt make thy prayer
unto him, and he shall hear thee,
and thou shalt pay thy a vows.

Chapter 23
Job seeks the Lord and asserts his
own righteousness—He says, When the
Lord has tried me, I will come forth
as gold.
Then Job answered and said,
2 Even to day is my a complaint
bitter: my stroke is heavier than
my groaning.
3 Oh that I knew where I might
find him! that I might come even
to his seat!
4 I would order my cause before
him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
5 I would know the words which he
would answer me, and understand
what he would say unto me.
6 Will he plead against me with
his great power? No; but he would
put a strength in me.

8 Behold, I go forward, but he is
not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:
9 On the left hand, where he doth
work, but I cannot behold him: he
hideth himself on the right hand,
that I cannot see him:
10 But he a knoweth the way that I
take: when he hath b tried me, I shall

more than my necessary food.
13 But he is in one mind, and who
can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.

is appointed for me: and many such
things are with him.
15 Therefore am I a troubled at

Chapter 24
Murderers, adulterers, those who oppress
the poor, and wicked people in general
often go unpunished for a little while.
Why, seeing times are not hidden
from the Almighty, do they that
know him not see his days?
2 Some remove the a landmarks;
they violently take away flocks,
and feed thereof.
3 They drive away the ass of the
fatherless, they take the widow’s
ox for a pledge.
4 They turn the needy out of the
way: the poor of the earth hide
themselves together.
5 Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work;
rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and
for their children.
6 They reap every one his a corn in
the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.
7 They cause the naked to lodge
without clothing, that they have no
covering in the cold.
8 They are wet with the showers
of the mountains, and embrace the
rock for want of a shelter.

Job reproves Bildad’s lack of empathy—He extols the power, greatness,
and strength of the Lord.
But Job answered and said,
2 How hast thou helped him that

3 How hast thou counselled him
that hath no wisdom? and how hast

neither shall silver be weighed for
the price thereof.
16 It cannot be valued with the

onyx, or the sapphire.
17 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it
shall not be for jewels of fine gold.

20 Whence then cometh wisdom?
and where is the place of understanding?

themselves: and the aged arose, and

and laid their hand on their mouth.
10 The nobles held their peace, and

11 When the ear heard me, then it
blessed me; and when the eye saw
me, it gave witness to me:
12 Because I delivered the a poor
that cried, and the fatherless, and
him that had none to help him.
13 The blessing of him that was
ready to perish came upon me: and
I caused the widow’s heart to sing
for joy.
14 I put on a righteousness, and it
clothed me: my judgment was as a
robe and a diadem.
15 I was eyes to the blind, and feet
was I to the lame.

of his teeth.
18 Then I said, I shall die in my
nest, and I shall multiply my days
as the sand.
19 My root was spread out by the
waters, and the dew lay all night
upon my branch.
20 My glory was fresh in me, and
my bow was renewed in my hand.
21 Unto me men gave ear, and
waited, and kept silence at my
counsel.
22 After my words they spake
not again; and my speech dropped
upon them.
23 And they waited for me as for
the rain; and they opened their
mouth wide as for the latter rain.
24 If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my
countenance they cast not down.
25 I chose out their way, and sat
chief, and dwelt as a king in the army,
as one that comforteth the mourners.
Chapter 30
Job is derided by the children of vile
and base men—In his afflicted state,
he cries to the Lord—Job says that he
wept for those in trouble.
But now they that are younger than
I have me in derision, whose fathers
I would have disdained to have set
with the dogs of my flock.
2 Yea, whereto might the strength
of their hands profit me, in whom
old age was perished?
3 For want and famine they were
solitary; fleeing into the wilderness
in former time desolate and waste.
4 Who cut up mallows by the bushes,
and juniper roots for their meat.
5 They were driven forth from
among men, (they cried after them
as after a thief;)
6 To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in
the rocks.
7 Among the bushes they brayed;
under the nettles they were gathered together.

8 They were children of fools, yea,
children of base men: they were
viler than the earth.
9 And now am I their a song, yea,
I am their byword.
10 They abhor me, they flee far
from me, and spare not to spit in
my face.
11 Because a he hath loosed my
cord, and afflicted me, they have
also let loose the bridle before me.
12 Upon my right hand rise the
youth; they push away my feet, and
they raise up against me the ways
of their destruction.
13 They mar my path, they set
forward my calamity, they have
no helper.
14 They came upon me as a wide
breaking in of waters: in the deso­
lation they rolled themselves  upon
me.
15 Terrors are turned upon me:
they pursue my soul as the wind:
and my welfare passeth away as a
cloud.
16 And now my soul is poured out
upon me; the days of affliction have
taken hold upon me.
17 My bones are pierced in me in
the night season: and my sinews
take no rest.
18 By the great force of my disease
is my garment changed: it bindeth
me about as the collar of my coat.
19 He hath cast me into the mire,
and I am become like dust and
ashes.
20 I cry unto thee, and thou dost
not a hear me: I stand up, and thou
regardest me not.
21 Thou art become a cruel to me:
with thy strong hand thou opposest
thyself against me.
22 Thou liftest me up to the wind;
thou causest me to ride upon it, and
dissolvest my substance.
23 For I know that thou wilt bring
me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.

his hand to the grave, though they
cry in his destruction.

25 Did not I weep for him that was
in trouble? was not my soul grieved
for the poor?
26 When I looked for a good, then
evil came unto me: and when I waited
for light, there came darkness.
27 My bowels boiled, and rested
not: the days of affliction prevented me.
28 I went mourning without the
sun: I stood up, and I cried in the
congregation.
29 I am a brother to dragons, and

Job invites judgment so that God may

Job welcomes the penalties for so doing.

Elihu, in anger, answers Job and his
three friends—Elihu says, There is a

Almighty gives understanding—He also
says, Great men are not always wise.
So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous
in his own eyes.
2 Then was kindled the wrath
of Elihu the son of Barachel the
Buzite, of the kindred of Ram:
against Job was his wrath kindled,
because he justified himself rather
than God.
3 Also against his three friends
was his wrath kindled, because
they had found no answer, and yet
had condemned Job.
4 Now Elihu had waited till Job
had spoken, because they were elder than he.
5 When Elihu saw that there was no
answer in the mouth of these three
men, then his wrath was kindled.
6 And Elihu the son of Barachel
the Buzite answered and said, I am
young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew
you mine opinion.
7 I said, Days should speak, and
multitude of years should teach

8 But there is a a spirit in man: and

11 Behold, I waited for your words;
I gave ear to your reasons, whilst

found out wisdom: God thrusteth

14 Now he hath not directed his
words against me: neither will I
answer him with your speeches.
15 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.
16 When I had waited, (for they
spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)
17 I said, I will answer also my
part, I also will shew mine opinion.
18 For I am full of matter, the
spirit within me constraineth me.
19 Behold, my belly is as wine
which hath no vent; it is ready to
burst like new a bottles.
20 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and
answer.
21 Let me not, I pray you, accept
any man’s person, neither let me
give flattering titles unto man.
22 For I know not to give a flattering titles; in so doing my maker
would soon take me away.
Chapter 33
Elihu says, God is greater than man,
He speaks to man in dreams and visions, He ransoms those cast into the
pit, and He delivers their souls and

Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear

my words.
2 Behold, now I have opened my
mouth, my tongue hath spoken in
my mouth.
3 My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall
utter knowledge clearly.
4 The a Spirit of God hath made

hath given me life.

10 Behold, he findeth occasions
against me, he counteth me for

11 He putteth my feet in the stocks,

12 Behold, in this thou art not
just: I will answer thee, that God
is a greater than man.
13 Why dost thou strive against
him? for he giveth not account of
any of his matters.
14 For God speaketh once, yea
twice, yet man perceiveth it not.

night, when deep sleep falleth
upon men, in slumberings upon
the bed;
16 Then he openeth the ears of
men, and sealeth their instruction,
17 That he may withdraw man
from his purpose, and hide pride
from man.
18 He keepeth back his soul from

and his soul dainty meat.
21 His flesh is consumed away, that
it cannot be seen; and his bones that
were not seen stick out.

unto the grave, and his life to the

27 He looketh upon men, and if
any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it

28 He will deliver his soul from

29 Lo, all these things worketh God

Elihu teaches, God cannot be unjust,
commit iniquity, pervert judgment,
or respect persons—Man should bear
chastisement and do iniquity no more.
Furthermore Elihu answered and
said,
2 Hear my words, O ye wise men;
and give ear unto me, ye that have
knowledge.
3 For the ear trieth words, as the
mouth tasteth meat.
4 Let us choose to us judgment:

8 Which goeth in company with

9 For he hath said, It profiteth a
man nothing that he should delight
himself with God.
10 Therefore hearken unto me,
ye men of understanding: far be it
from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he
should commit iniquity.
11 For the a work of a man shall he
render unto him, and cause every
man to find according to his ways.
12 Yea, surely God will not do
wickedly, neither will the Almighty
pervert a judgment.
13 Who hath given him a charge

14 If he set his heart upon man,
if he gather unto himself his spirit

and man shall turn again unto

20 In a moment shall they die,
and the people shall be troubled

Job 34:22–35:16

22 There is no darkness, nor shadow
of death, where the workers of iniquity may a hide themselves.
23 For he will not lay upon man
more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.
24 He shall break in pieces mighty
men without number, and set others in their stead.
25 Therefore he knoweth their
works, and he overturneth them in
the night, so that they are destroyed.
26 He striketh them as wicked men
in the open sight of others;
27 Because they turned back from
him, and would not consider any
of his ways:
28 So that they cause the cry of
the poor to come unto him, and
he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
29 When he giveth a  quietness,
who then can make trouble? and
when he hideth his face, who then
can behold him? whether it be done
against a nation, or against a man
only:
30 That the hypocrite reign not,
lest the people be ensnared.
31 Surely it is meet to be said unto
God, I have borne a chastisement, I
will not offend any more:
32 That which I see not teach thou
me: if I have done iniquity, I will
do no more.
33 Should it be according to thy
mind? he will recompense it,
whether thou refuse, or whether
thou choose; and not I: therefore
speak what thou knowest.
34 Let men of understanding tell
me, and let a wise man hearken
unto me.
35 Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without
wisdom.
36 My desire is that Job may be
tried unto the end because of his
answers for wicked men.
37 For he addeth rebellion unto his
sin, he clappeth his hands among us,
and multiplieth his words against
God.
	22	a	 Alma 12:14 (14–15);
D&C 1:2.

Chapter 35
Elihu contrasts the weakness of man and
the power of God—Our wickedness hurts
other men, and our righteousness helps
them—Man should trust in the Lord.
Elihu spake moreover, and said,
2 Thinkest thou this to be right,
that thou saidst, My righteousness
is more than God’s?
3 For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What
profit shall I have, if I be cleansed
from my sin?
4 I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.
5 Look unto the heavens, and see;
and behold the clouds which are
higher than thou.
6 If thou sinnest, what doest thou
against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest
thou unto him?
7 If thou be a righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he
of thine hand?
8 Thy wickedness may hurt a man
as thou art; and thy righteousness
may profit the son of man.
9 By reason of the multitude of
oppressions they make the oppressed
to cry: they cry out by reason of the
arm of the mighty.
10 But none saith, Where is God
my maker, who giveth a songs in
the night;
11 Who teacheth us more than the
beasts of the earth, and maketh us
wiser than the fowls of heaven?
12 There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride
of evil men.
13 Surely God will not hear vanity,
neither will the Almighty regard it.
14 Although thou sayest thou shalt
not see him, yet judgment is before
him; therefore trust thou in him.
15 But now, because it is not so,
he hath visited in his anger; yet he
knoweth it not in great extremity:
16 Therefore doth Job open his
mouth in vain; he multiplieth words
without knowledge.

Chapter 36
Elihu says, Those who are righteous are
prospered—The wicked perish and die
without knowledge—Elihu praises the
greatness of God.
Elihu also proceeded, and said,
2 Suffer me a little, and I will
shew thee that I have yet to speak
on God’s behalf.
3 I will fetch my knowledge from
afar, and will ascribe righteousness
to my Maker.
4 For truly my words shall not be
false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
5 Behold, God is mighty, and a despiseth not any: he is mighty in
strength and b wisdom.
6 He preserveth not the life of the
wicked: but giveth right to the poor.
7 He withdraweth not his eyes
from the righteous: but with kings
are they on the throne; yea, he doth
establish them for ever, and they
are exalted.
8 And if they be bound in fetters,
and be holden in cords of affliction;
9 Then he sheweth them their
work, and their transgressions that
they have exceeded.
10 He openeth also their ear to
discipline, and commandeth that
they return from iniquity.
11 If they obey and serve him, they
shall spend their a days in prosperity, and their years in b pleasures.
12 But if they a obey not, they shall
perish by the sword, and they
shall die without knowledge.
13 But the hypocrites in heart
heap up wrath: they cry not when
he bindeth them.
14 They die in youth, and their
life is among the unclean.
15 He a delivereth the poor in his
affliction, and openeth their ears
in oppression.
16 Even so would he have removed
thee out of the strait into a broad

and that which should be set on

know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.
27 For he maketh small the drops
of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:
28 Which the clouds do drop and
distil upon man abundantly.
29 Also can any understand the
spreadings of the clouds, or the
noise of his tabernacle?
30 Behold, he spreadeth his light
upon it, and covereth the bottom
of the sea.
31 For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.
32 With clouds he covereth the
light; and commandeth it not to shine
by the cloud that cometh betwixt.
33 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.

Job 37:2–38:7

2 Hear attentively the noise of his
voice, and the sound that goeth out
of his mouth.
3 He directeth it under the whole
heaven, and his lightning unto the
ends of the earth.
4 After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them
when his voice is heard.
5 God thundereth marvellously
with his voice; great things doeth
he, which we cannot comprehend.
6 For he saith to the a snow, Be
thou on the earth; likewise to the
small rain, and to the great rain of
his strength.
7 He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know
his work.
8 Then the beasts go into dens,
and remain in their places.
9 Out of the south cometh the
whirlwind: and cold out of the
north.
10 By the breath of God frost is
given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.
11 Also by watering he wearieth
the thick cloud: he scattereth his
bright cloud:
12 And it is turned round about by
his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon
the face of the world in the earth.
13 He causeth it to come, whether
for correction, or for his land, or
for mercy.
14 Hearken unto this, O Job: stand
still, and a consider the wondrous
b 
works of God.
15 Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light
of his cloud to shine?
16 Dost thou know the balancings
of the clouds, the wondrous works of
him which is perfect in a knowledge?
17 How thy garments are warm,
when he quieteth the earth by the
south wind?

Chapter 39
Man’s weakness and ignorance are
compared with God’s mighty works—
Does man even know how the laws of
nature operate?
Knowest thou the time when the
wild a goats of the rock bring forth?
or canst thou mark when the hinds
do calve?
2 Canst thou number the months
that they fulfil? or knowest thou the
time when they bring forth?
3 They bow themselves, they bring
forth their young ones, they cast
out their sorrows.
4 Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they
go forth, and return not unto them.
5 Who hath sent out the wild ass
free? or who hath loosed the bands
of the wild ass?
6 Whose house I have made the
wilderness, and the barren land
his dwellings.
7 He scorneth the multitude of
the city, neither regardeth he the
crying of the driver.
8 The range of the mountains is
his pasture, and he searcheth after
every green thing.
9 Will the a unicorn be willing to
serve thee, or abide by thy crib?
10 Canst thou bind the unicorn
with his band in the furrow? or will
he harrow the valleys after thee?
11 Wilt thou trust him, because

leave thy labour to him?
12 Wilt thou believe him, that
he will bring home thy seed, and
gather it into thy barn?

young ones, as though they were not
hers: her labour is in vain without
fear;
17 Because God hath deprived her
of wisdom, neither hath he imparted
to her understanding.
18 What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse
and his rider.
19 Hast thou given the horse
strength? hast thou clothed his neck
with thunder?
20 Canst thou make him afraid
as a grasshopper? the glory of his
nostrils is terrible.
21 He paweth in the valley, and
rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth
on to meet the armed men.
22 He mocketh at fear, and is not
affrighted; neither turneth he back
from the sword.
23 The quiver rattleth against him,
the glittering spear and the shield.
24 He swalloweth the ground
with fierceness and rage: neither
believeth he that it is the sound of
the trumpet.
25 He saith among the trumpets,
Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle
afar off, the thunder of the captains,
and the shouting.
26 Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward
the south?
27 Doth the eagle mount up at
thy command, and make her nest
on high?
28 She dwelleth and abideth on
the rock, upon the crag of the rock,
and the strong place.
29 From thence she seeketh the

Chapter 40
The Lord challenges Job, and Job replies humbly—The Lord speaks of His
power to Job—He asks, Hast thou an
arm like God?—He points to His power
in the behemoth.
Moreover the Lord answered Job,
and said,

2 Shall he that contendeth with
the Almighty instruct him? he that
reproveth God, let him answer it.
3 ¶ Then Job answered the Lord,
and said,
4 Behold, I am vile; what shall I
answer thee? I will lay mine hand
upon my mouth.
5 Once have I spoken; but I will not
answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.
6 ¶ Then answered the Lord unto
Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
7 Gird up thy loins now like a man:
I will demand of thee, and declare
thou unto me.
8 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that
thou mayest be righteous?
9 Hast thou an arm like God? or
canst thou thunder with a voice
like him?
10 Deck thyself now with majesty
and excellency; and array thyself
with glory and beauty.
11 Cast abroad the rage of thy
wrath: and behold every one that
is a proud, and abase him.
12 Look on every one that is proud,
and bring him low; and tread down
the wicked in their place.
13 Hide them in the dust together;
and bind their faces in secret.
14 Then will I also confess unto
thee that thine own right hand can
save thee.
15 ¶ Behold now behemoth, which
I made with thee; he eateth grass
as an ox.
16 Lo now, his strength is in his
loins, and his force is in the navel
of his belly.
17 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are
wrapped together.
18 His bones are as strong pieces of
brass; his bones are like bars of iron.
19 He is the chief of the ways of
God: he that made him can make
his sword to approach unto him.
20 Surely the mountains bring him
forth food, where all the beasts of
the field play.
40	11	a	 Isa. 2:12;

2 Ne. 12:12; 23:11;

21 He lieth under the shady trees,
in the covert of the reed, and a fens.
22 The shady trees cover him with
their shadow; the willows of the
brook compass him about.
23 Behold, he drinketh up a river,
and hasteth not: he trusteth that
he can draw up Jordan into his
mouth.
24 He taketh it with his eyes: his
nose pierceth through snares.
Chapter 41
The Lord points to His power in the
leviathan—All things under the whole
heaven are the Lord’s.
Canst thou draw out leviathan with
an hook? or his tongue with a cord
which thou lettest down?
2 Canst thou put an hook into his
nose? or bore his jaw through with
a thorn?
3 Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft
words unto thee?
4 Will he make a covenant with
thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?
5 Wilt thou play with him as with
a bird? or wilt thou bind him for
thy maidens?
6 Shall the companions make a
banquet of him? shall they part
him among the merchants?
7 Canst thou fill his skin with
a 
barbed irons? or his head with
fish spears?
8 Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.
9 Behold, the hope of him is in
vain: shall not one be cast down
even at the sight of him?
10 None is so fierce that dare stir
him up: who then is able to stand
before me?
11 Who hath prevented me, that
I should repay him? whatsoever is
under the whole heaven is mine.

nor his power, nor his comely proportion.

him with his double bridle?
14 Who can open the doors of his
face? his teeth are terrible round
about.
15 His scales are his pride, shut up
together as with a close seal.
16 One is so near to another, that
no air can come between them.
17 They are joined one to another,
they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
18 By his a neesings a light doth
shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
19 Out of his mouth go burning
lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.
20 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke,
as out of a seething pot or caldron.
21 His breath kindleth coals, and
a flame goeth out of his mouth.
22 In his neck remaineth strength,
and sorrow is turned into joy before him.
23 The flakes of his flesh are
joined together: they are firm in
themselves; they cannot be moved.
24 His heart is as firm as a stone;
yea, as hard as a piece of the nether
millstone.
25 When he raiseth up himself,
the mighty are afraid: by reason of
breakings they purify themselves.
26 The sword of him that layeth
at him cannot hold: the spear, the
dart, nor the habergeon.
27 He esteemeth iron as straw, and
brass as rotten wood.
28 The arrow cannot make him
flee: slingstones are turned with
him into stubble.
29 Darts are counted as stubble: he
laugheth at the shaking of a spear.
30 Sharp stones are under him:
he spreadeth sharp pointed things
upon the mire.
31 He maketh the deep to boil like
a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot
of ointment.
32 He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep
to be hoary.

Job repents in dust and ashes—He sees
the Lord with his eyes—The Lord chastises Job’s friends, accepts Job, blesses
him, and makes his latter days greater
than his beginning.
Then Job answered the Lord, and
said,
2 I know that thou canst a do b every thing, and that no thought can
be withholden from thee.
3 Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore
have I uttered that I understood
not; things too a wonderful for me,
which I knew not.
4 Hear, I beseech thee, and I will
speak: I will demand of thee, and
declare thou unto me.
5 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye
seeth thee.
6 Wherefore I abhor myself, and
repent in dust and a ashes.
7 ¶ And it was so, that after the
Lord had spoken these words unto
Job, the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against
thee, and against thy two friends: for
ye have not spoken of me the thing
that is right, as my servant Job hath.
8 Therefore take unto you now
seven bullocks and seven rams, and
go to my servant Job, and offer up
for yourselves a burnt a offering; and
my servant Job shall b pray for you:
for him will I accept: lest I deal with
you after your folly, in that ye have
not spoken of me the thing which is
right, like my servant Job.
9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and
Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the
Naamathite went, and did according
as the Lord commanded them: the
Lord also a accepted Job.

10 And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he a prayed for
his b friends: also the Lord gave Job
twice as much as he had before.
11 Then came there unto him all
his brethren, and all his sisters,
and all they that had been of his
acquaintance before, and did eat
bread with him in his house: and
they bemoaned him, and comforted
him over all the evil that the Lord
had brought upon him: every man
also gave him a piece of money, and
every one an earring of gold.
12 So the Lord a blessed the latter
end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand
sheep, and six thousand camels,

and a thousand yoke of oxen, and
a thousand she asses.
13 He had also seven sons and
three daughters.
14 And he called the name of the
first, Jemima; and the name of
the second, Kezia; and the name
of the third, Keren-happuch.
15 And in all the land were no
women found so fair as the daughters
of Job: and their father gave them
inheritance among their brethren.
16 After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his
sons, and his sons’ sons, even four
generations.
17 So Job died, being old and full
of days.

4 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon

5 Offer the a sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord.
6 There be many that say, Who will

7 Thou hast put gladness in my

Psalm 5
David asks the Lord to hear his voice—

To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth,
A Psalm of David.

2 Hearken unto the voice of my
cry, my a King, and my God: for
unto thee will I pray.
3 My voice shalt thou hear in the
morning, O Lord; in the a morning
will I direct my prayer unto thee,
and will look up.
4 For thou art not a God that hath
pleasure in a wickedness: neither
shall b evil dwell with thee.
5 The foolish shall not stand in
thy sight: thou hatest all a workers
of iniquity.
6 Thou shalt destroy them that
speak leasing: the Lord will abhor

10 Destroy thou them, O God; let
them fall by their own counsels;
cast them out in the multitude of

David trusts in the Lord, who will

Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the

Benjamite.

O Lord my God, in thee do I put
my trust: save me from all them
that persecute me, and deliver me:
2 Lest he tear my soul like a lion,
rending it in pieces, while there is
none to deliver.
3 O Lord my God, if I have done
this; if there be iniquity in my
hands;
4 If I have rewarded evil unto him
that was at peace with me; (yea, I
have delivered him that without
cause is mine enemy:)
5 Let the enemy persecute my
soul, and take it; yea, let him tread
down my life upon the earth,

David pleads with the Lord to hear his

A Prayer of David.

Hear the right, O Lord, attend unto

that goeth not out of feigned lips.
2 Let my sentence come forth from
thy presence; let thine eyes behold
the things that are equal.
3 Thou hast a proved mine heart;
thou hast visited me in the night;
thou hast tried me, and shalt find
nothing; I am purposed that my
mouth shall not transgress.
4 Concerning the works of men,
by the word of thy lips I have kept
me from the paths of the destroyer.
5 a Hold up my goings in thy paths,
that my footsteps slip not.
6 I have called upon thee, for thou
wilt hear me, O God: incline thine
ear unto me, and a hear my speech.
7 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy
right hand them which put their
trust in thee from those that rise up
against them.
8 Keep me as the apple of the eye,
hide me under the shadow of thy
wings,

me, from my deadly enemies, who
compass me about.

PSALM 18:5–34

5 The sorrows of hell compassed
me about: the snares of death a prevented me.
6 In my a distress I called upon the
Lord, and cried unto my God: he
heard my voice out of his b temple,
and my cry came before him, even
into his ears.
7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the
hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.
8 There went up a smoke out of his
nostrils, and fire out of his mouth
devoured: coals were kindled by it.
9 He bowed the heavens also, and
came down: and darkness was under his feet.
10 And he rode upon a cherub,
and did fly: yea, he did fly upon
the wings of the wind.
11 He made darkness his secret
place; his pavilion round about him
were dark waters and thick clouds
of the skies.
12 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed,
hail stones and coals of fire.
13 The Lord also thundered in
the heavens, and the Highest gave
his voice; hail stones and coals of
fire.
14 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and
scattered them; and he shot out
lightnings, and discomfited them.
15 Then the channels of waters
were seen, and the foundations of
the world were discovered at thy
rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the
breath of thy nostrils.
16 He sent from above, he took me,
he drew me out of many waters.
17 He delivered me from my strong
enemy, and from them which hated
me: for they were too strong for me.
18 They prevented me in the day
of my calamity: but the Lord was
my stay.

a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
20 The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness; according
to the cleanness of my hands hath
he recompensed me.
21 For I have kept the ways of
the Lord, and have not wickedly
departed from my God.
22 For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his
statutes from me.
23 I was also upright before him,
and I kept myself from mine iniquity.
24 Therefore hath the Lord recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the a cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
25 With the merciful thou wilt
shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself
upright;
26 With the pure thou wilt shew
thyself pure; and a with the froward
thou wilt shew thyself froward.
27 For thou wilt save the a afflicted
people; but wilt bring down b high
looks.
28 For thou wilt light my a candle:
the Lord my God will b enlighten
my darkness.
29 For by thee I have run through a
troop; and by my God have I leaped
over a wall.
30 As for God, his way is a perfect:
the b word of the Lord is tried: he is a
buckler to all those that trust in him.
31 For who is God save the Lord?
or who is a a rock save our God?
32 It is a God that girdeth me with
strength, and maketh my way perfect.
33 He maketh my feet like hinds’
feet, and setteth me upon my high
places.
34 He teacheth my hands to war,
so that a bow of steel is broken by
mine arms.

35 Thou hast also given me the

right hand hath holden me up, and
thy gentleness hath made me great.
36 Thou hast enlarged my steps
under me, that my feet did not slip.
37 I have pursued mine enemies,
and overtaken them: neither did I
turn again till they were consumed.
38 I have wounded them that they
were not able to rise: they are fallen
under my feet.
39 For thou hast girded me with
strength unto the battle: thou hast
subdued under me those that rose
up against me.
40 Thou hast also given me the
necks of mine enemies; that I might
destroy them that hate me.
41 They a cried, but there was none
to save them: even unto the Lord,
but he answered them not.
42 Then did I beat them small as
the dust before the wind: I did cast
them out as the dirt in the streets.
43 Thou hast delivered me from
the strivings of the people; and
thou hast made me the head of the

known shall serve me.
44 As soon as they hear of me, they

Psalm 40
A messianic psalm of David—The Messiah will come and preach righteousness—
He will declare salvation—The righteous
will say, The Lord be magnified.
To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

I a waited patiently for the Lord;
and he inclined unto me, and heard
my cry.
2 He brought me up also out of an
horrible pit, out of the miry clay,
and set my feet upon a a rock, and
established my goings.
3 And he hath put a a new b song
in my mouth, even praise unto our
God: many shall see it, and fear, and
shall trust in the Lord.
4 Blessed is that man that maketh
the Lord his trust, and respecteth
not the proud, nor such as turn
aside to lies.
5 Many, O Lord my God, are thy
wonderful a works which thou hast
done, and thy thoughts which are to
us-ward: they cannot be reckoned
up in order unto thee: if I would
declare and speak of them, they are
more than can be numbered.

God: yea, thy law is within my
heart.
9 I have preached righteousness
in the great congregation: lo, I have
not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou
knowest.
10 I have not hid thy righteousness
within my heart; I have declared
thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I
have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great
congregation.
11 Withhold not thou thy tender
a 
mercies from me, O Lord: let thy
lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.
12 For innumerable evils have
compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that
I am not able to look up; they are
more than the hairs of mine head:
therefore my heart a faileth me.
13 Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver
me: O Lord, make haste to help me.
14 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after
my soul to destroy it; let them be
driven backward and put to shame
that wish me evil.
15 Let them be desolate for a reward of their a shame that say unto
me, Aha, aha.
16 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as
love thy salvation say continually,
The Lord be magnified.
17 But I am poor and needy; yet
the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art
my help and my deliverer; a make
no tarrying, O my God.

2 The Lord will a preserve him,
and keep him alive; and he shall be
blessed upon the earth: and thou
wilt not deliver him unto the will
of his enemies.
3 The Lord will strengthen him
upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt
a 
make all his bed in his b sickness.
4 I said, Lord, be merciful unto
me: a heal my soul; for I have sinned
against thee.
5 Mine enemies speak evil of me,
When shall he die, and his name
perish?
6 And if he come to see me, he
speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth
iniquity to itself; when he goeth
abroad, he telleth it.
7 All that hate me whisper together
against me: against me do they devise my hurt.
8 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth
fast unto him: and now that he lieth
he shall rise up no more.
9 Yea, mine own familiar a friend,
in whom I trusted, which did eat of
my bread, hath lifted up his b heel
against me.
10 But thou, O Lord, be merciful
unto me, and raise me up, that I
may requite them.
11 By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth
not triumph over me.
12 And as for me, thou upholdest
me in mine integrity, and settest
me before thy face for ever.
13 a Blessed be the Lord God of
Israel from everlasting, and to
everlasting. Amen, and Amen.

3 My tears have been my meat
day and night, while they continu­

4 When I remember these things,
I pour out my soul in me: for I
had gone with the multitude, I
went with them to the house of

praise, with a multitude that kept

6 O my God, my soul is cast down

waves and thy billows are gone

8 Yet the Lord will command his
lovingkindness in the daytime, and
in the a night his song shall be with
me, and my prayer unto the God
of my life.
9 I will say unto God my rock,
Why hast thou forgotten me? why

mine enemies reproach me; while

though the mountains be carried

3 Though the waters thereof roar

thereof. Selah.
4 There is a river, the streams
whereof shall make glad the city

5 God is in the a midst of her; she
shall not be moved: God shall help
her, and that right early.

were moved: he uttered his voice,
the earth melted.
7 The a Lord of hosts is with us;
the God of Jacob is our refuge.

8 Come, behold the works of the
Lord, what desolations he hath
made in the earth.
9 He maketh a wars to cease unto

so is thy praise unto the ends of

Psalm 49

Men cannot be ransomed or redeemed
by wealth—God alone can redeem a
soul from the grave—The glory of a
rich man ceases with his death.
To the chief Musician,
A Psalm for the sons of Korah.

Hear this, all ye people; give a ear,
all ye inhabitants of the world:
2 Both low and high, rich and
poor, together.
3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom;
and the meditation of my heart shall
be of understanding.
4 I will incline mine ear to a para­
ble: I will a open my dark saying
upon the harp.
5 Wherefore should I fear in the
days of evil, when the iniquity
of my a  heels shall compass me
about?
6 They that trust in their a wealth,
and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;
7 None of them can by any means
redeem his brother, nor give to God
a ransom for him:
8 (For the redemption of their a soul
is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)
9 That he should still a live for ever,
and not see corruption.
10 For he seeth that wise men
a 
die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their
wealth to others.
11 Their inward thought is, that
their houses shall continue for ever,
and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after
their own a names.
12 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts
that perish.
13 This their way is their folly:
yet their posterity approve their
sayings. Selah.

of God endureth continually.
2 Thy a tongue deviseth mischiefs;
like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
3 Thou lovest evil more than good;
and lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.
4 Thou lovest all devouring words,
O thou deceitful tongue.
5 God shall likewise destroy thee
for ever, he shall take thee away,
and a pluck thee out of thy dwelling
place, and root thee out of the land

6 The righteous also shall see, and

in the abundance of his riches, and
strengthened himself in his wickedness.
8 But I am like a a green olive tree

14 We took sweet counsel together,

therefore they fear not God.
20 He hath put forth his hands
against such as be at peace with

21 The words of his mouth were

5 Every day they wrest my words:

9 When I cry unto thee, then shall

Psalm 63

David thirsts for God, whom he praises
with joyful lips.
A Psalm of David, when he was
in the wilderness of Judah.

O God, thou art my God; a early will
I seek thee: my soul b thirsteth for
thee, my flesh longeth for thee in
a dry and c thirsty land, where no
water is;
2 To see thy power and thy glory, so
as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.
3 Because thy lovingkindness
is a better than life, my lips shall
praise thee.
4 Thus will I bless thee while I
live: I will lift up my a hands in thy
name.
5 My soul shall be satisfied as with
marrow and fatness; and my mouth
shall praise thee with joyful lips:
6 When I remember thee upon my
a 
bed, and b meditate on thee in the
night watches.
7 Because thou hast been my help,
therefore in the shadow of thy wings
will I rejoice.
8 My soul followeth hard after
thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.
9 But those that seek my soul, to
destroy it, shall go into the lower
parts of the earth.
10 They shall fall by the sword:
they shall be a portion for a foxes.
11 But the king shall rejoice in
God; every one that sweareth by him
shall glory: but the mouth of them
that speak lies shall be stopped.

3 I am weary of my crying: my
throat is dried: mine eyes fail while
I wait for my God.
4 They that a hate me without a
cause are more than the hairs of
mine head: they that would destroy
me, being mine enemies wrongfully,
are mighty: then I restored that
which I took not away.
5 O God, thou knowest my a foolishness; and my sins are not hid
from thee.
6 Let not them that wait on thee,
O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed
for my sake: let not those that seek
thee be confounded for my sake, O
God of Israel.
7 Because for thy sake I have
borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.
8 I am become a stranger unto
my brethren, and an alien unto my
mother’s children.
9 For the a zeal of thine house hath
eaten me up; and the b reproaches
of them that reproached thee are
fallen upon me.
10 When I wept, and chastened my
soul with a fasting, that was to my
reproach.
11 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to
them.
12 They that sit in the gate speak
against me; and I was the a song of

thy mercy hear me, in the truth
of thy salvation.

will yet praise thee more and more.
15 My mouth shall shew forth thy
righteousness and thy salvation all
the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.
16 I will go in the a strength of the
Lord God: I will make mention of
thy righteousness, even of thine
only.
17 O God, thou hast taught me
from my youth: and hitherto have
I declared thy wondrous works.
18 Now also when I am old and
grayheaded, O God, forsake me not;
until I have shewed thy strength
unto this generation, and thy power
to every one that is to come.
19 Thy a righteousness also, O God,
is very b high, who hast done great
things: O God, who is c like unto
thee!
20 Thou, which hast shewed me
great and sore troubles, shalt
a 
quicken me again, and shalt bring
me up again from the depths of the
earth.
21 Thou shalt increase my greatness, and a comfort me on every side.
22 I will also praise thee with the
psaltery, even thy truth, O my God:
unto thee will I sing with the harp,
O thou Holy One of Israel.
23 My lips shall greatly rejoice
when I sing unto thee; and my soul,
which thou hast redeemed.
24 My tongue also shall talk of
thy righteousness all the day long:
for they are confounded, for they
are brought unto a shame, that seek
my hurt.

righteousness, and thy poor with
judgment.
3 The mountains shall bring peace
to the people, and the little hills,

4 He shall judge the poor of the
people, he shall save the children
of the needy, and shall break in

5 They shall fear thee as long as the

2 In the day of my trouble I a sought
the Lord: my sore ran in the night,
and ceased not: my soul refused to

4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot

5 I have considered the days of old,

and will he be favourable no
more?

doth his promise fail for evermore?

bread also? can he provide flesh
for his people?
21 Therefore the Lord heard this,
and was wroth: so a a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also
came up against Israel;
22 Because they a believed not in
God, and b trusted not in his salvation:
23 Though he had commanded the
clouds from above, and opened the
doors of heaven,
24 And had rained down manna
upon them to eat, and had given
them of the a corn of heaven.
25 Man did eat a angels’ food: he
sent them meat to the full.
26 He caused an a east wind to blow
in the heaven: and by his power he
brought in the south wind.
27 He rained flesh also upon them
as dust, and feathered a fowls like
as the sand of the sea:

habitations.

was yet in their mouths,

lied unto him with their tongues.
37 For their a heart was not right
with him, neither were they b steadfast in his covenant.
38 But he, being full of compassion,
forgave their iniquity, and destroyed
them not: yea, many a time turned
he his anger away, and did not stir
up all his wrath.
39 For he remembered that they
were but a flesh; a wind that passeth
away, and cometh not again.
40 How oft did they a provoke him
in the wilderness, and grieve him in
the desert!
41 Yea, they turned back and
tempted God, and limited the Holy
One of Israel.
42 They remembered not his hand,
nor the day when he delivered them
from the enemy.
43 How he had wrought his signs
in Egypt, and his wonders in the
field of Zoan:
44 And had turned their rivers
into blood; and their a floods, that
they could not drink.
45 He sent divers sorts of flies
among them, which devoured them;
and frogs, which destroyed them.
46 He gave also their increase unto
the caterpiller, and their labour
unto the a locust.
47 He destroyed their vines with
a 
hail, and their sycomore trees
with frost.
48 He gave up their cattle also
to the hail, and their flocks to hot
thunderbolts.

of his anger, wrath, and indignation,

and trouble, by sending a evil angels
among them.
50 He made a way to his anger; he
spared not their soul from death, but
gave their life over to the pestilence;
51 And smote all the a firstborn in
Egypt; the chief of their strength in
the b tabernacles of c Ham:
52 But made his own people to go
forth like sheep, and guided them
in the wilderness like a flock.
53 And he led them on safely, so
that they feared not: but the a sea
overwhelmed their enemies.
54 And he brought them a to the
border of his sanctuary, even to this
mountain, which his right hand had
purchased.
55 He cast out the heathen also
before them, and divided them an
inheritance by line, and made the
tribes of Israel to dwell in their
tents.
56 Yet they tempted and provoked
the most high God, and kept not his
testimonies:
57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they
were turned aside like a a deceitful bow.
58 For they a  provoked him to
anger with their high places, and
moved him to jealousy with their
graven images.
59 When God heard this, he was
wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of a Shiloh, the tent which he
placed among men;
61 And delivered his strength into
captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand.
62 He gave his people over also
unto the sword; and was wroth with
his inheritance.
63 The fire consumed their young
men; and their maidens were not
given to marriage.

64 Their priests fell by the sword;

that shouteth by reason of wine.
66 And he smote his enemies in

67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the
tribe of Ephraim:
68 But chose the tribe of Judah,

69 And he built his sanctuary like

he hath established for a ever.
70 He chose a David also his servant,
and took him from the sheepfolds:
71 From following the ewes great

Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.

A psalm or song for the Sabbath day—
Give thanks unto the Lord—His en­
emies will perish—The righteous will
flourish—There is no unrighteousness
in the Lord.
A Psalm or Song for the sabbath day.

It is a good thing to give a thanks
unto the Lord, and to sing praises
unto thy name, O most High:
2 To shew forth thy lovingkindness
in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,
3 Upon an instrument of ten
strings, and upon the psaltery; upon
the harp with a solemn sound.
4 For thou, Lord, hast made me
glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
5 O Lord, how great are thy
a 
works! and thy thoughts are very
deep.
6 A brutish man knoweth not;
neither doth a fool understand
this.
7 When the wicked spring as the
grass, and when all the workers of
iniquity do flourish; it is that they
shall be destroyed for ever:
8 But thou, Lord, art most high
for evermore.
9 For, lo, thine enemies, O Lord,
for, lo, thine enemies shall perish;
all the workers of iniquity shall be
scattered.
10 But my horn shalt thou exalt
like the horn of a an unicorn: I shall
be anointed with fresh oil.
11 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears
shall hear my desire of the wicked
that rise up against me.
12 The righteous shall a flourish
like the palm tree: he shall grow
like a cedar in Lebanon.
13 Those that be planted in the
house of the Lord shall flourish in
the courts of our God.

who created them will endure forever.
A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint
before the Lord.

Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let
my cry come unto thee.
2 a Hide not thy face from me in
the day when I am in trouble; incline
thine ear unto me: in the day when
I call answer me speedily.
3 For my days are consumed like
smoke, and my bones are burned
as an hearth.
4 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to
eat my bread.
5 By reason of the voice of my
groaning my bones cleave to my

6 I am like a a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.
7 I watch, and am as a sparrow
alone upon the house top.
8 Mine enemies reproach me all the
day; and they that are mad against
me are sworn against me.
9 For I have eaten ashes like bread,
and mingled my drink with weeping,
10 Because of thine indignation
and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted
me up, and cast me down.
11 My days are like a a shadow that
declineth; and I am withered like
b 
grass.
12 But thou, O Lord, shalt endure
for a ever; and thy remembrance
unto all generations.

favour her, yea, the set time, is come.

14 For thy servants take pleasure

15 So the heathen shall fear the
name of the Lord, and all the kings
of the earth thy glory.

17 He will regard the a prayer of

18 This shall be a written for the

19 For he hath looked down from

name.
2 Bless the Lord, O my soul, and
forget not all his benefits:
3 Who a forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy b diseases;
4 Who a redeemeth thy life from
destruction; who crowneth thee
with lovingkindness and tender
mercies;
5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with
good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the a eagle’s.
6 The Lord executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are
oppressed.
7 He made known his ways unto
Moses, his acts unto the children
of Israel.
8 The a Lord is b merciful and gracious, slow to c anger, and plenteous
in mercy.
9 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his a anger for ever.
10 He hath not dealt with us after
our sins; nor rewarded us according
to our iniquities.
11 For as the heaven is high above
the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.
12 As far as the east is from the
west, so far hath he removed our
transgressions from us.
13 Like as a father a pitieth his

that fear him.

Psalm 106
Praise the Lord for His mercy and
mighty works—Israel rebelled and did
wickedly—Moses mediated between Israel and the Lord—Israel was scattered
and slain for worshipping false gods.
a 
Praise ye the Lord. O give thanks
unto the Lord; for he is b good: for
his mercy endureth for ever.
2 Who can utter the mighty a acts
of the Lord? who can shew forth
all his praise?
3 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.
4 Remember me, O Lord, with the
favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;
5 That I may see the good of thy
chosen, that I may rejoice in the
gladness of thy nation, that I may
glory with thine inheritance.
6 We have a sinned with our fathers,
we have committed iniquity, we
have done wickedly.
7 Our fathers understood not thy
wonders in Egypt; they remembered
not the multitude of thy mercies;
but a provoked him at the sea, even
at the b Red sea.
8 Nevertheless he saved them for
his a name’s sake, that he might make
his mighty b power to be known.
9 He a rebuked the b Red sea also,
and it was dried up: so he led them
through the depths, as through the
wilderness.
10 And he saved them from the
hand of him that hated them, and
redeemed them from the hand of
the enemy.
11 And the waters covered their
enemies: there was not a  one of
them left.
12 Then believed they his words;
they sang his praise.

wilderness, and tempted God in
the desert.
15 And he gave them their request;
but sent leanness into their soul.
16 They a  envied Moses also in

the Lord.
17 The earth a opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the

18 And a a fire was kindled in their

19 They made a calf in Horeb, and
worshipped the a molten image.
20 Thus they changed their glory
into the similitude of an ox that

21 They forgat God their saviour,
which had done great things in
Egypt;
22 Wondrous works in the land
of Ham, and terrible things by the

23 Therefore he said that he would

30 Then stood up a Phinehas, and
executed judgment: and so the
plague was stayed.
31 And that was counted unto him
for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.
32 They angered him also at the
waters of a strife, so that it went ill
with Moses for their b sakes:
33 Because they provoked his
spirit, so that he a spake unadvisedly with his lips.
34 They did not a destroy the nations, concerning whom the Lord
commanded them:
35 But were a mingled among the
heathen, and learned their works.
36 And they served their a idols:
which were a snare unto them.
37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons
and their daughters unto devils,
38 And shed innocent a blood, even
the blood of their sons and of their
daughters, whom they sacrificed
unto the b idols of Canaan: and the
land was polluted with blood.
39 Thus were they defiled with
their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.
40 Therefore was the a wrath of
the Lord kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his
own inheritance.
41 And he gave them into the hand
of the heathen; and they that hated
them ruled over them.

them, and they were brought into

10 Such as sit in a darkness and in

in affliction and iron;
11 Because they a rebelled against
the words of God, and contemned

12 Therefore he brought down
their heart with labour; they fell
down, and there was none to help.

and the mouth of the deceitful
are opened against me: they have
spoken against me with a a lying
tongue.

with words of hatred; and fought
against me without a cause.

for good, and a hatred for my love.

prayer become sin.

Psalm 114
The Lord governs the sea and the land
for the blessing of His people.
When Israel went out of a Egypt,
the house of Jacob from a people
of strange language;
2 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.
3 The sea saw it, and a fled: Jordan
was driven back.
4 The mountains skipped like
rams, and the little hills like lambs.
5 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that
thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that
thou wast driven back?
6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like
rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?
7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of
the God of Jacob;
8 Which turned the rock into a
standing water, the flint into a
fountain of a waters.
Psalm 115
Our God is in the heavens—Idols are

Psalm 116

Gracious is the Lord, and righteous—
Precious in the sight of the Lord is the
death of His Saints.
I a love the Lord, because he hath
heard my voice and my supplications.
2 Because he hath inclined his ear
unto me, therefore will I call upon
him as long as I live.
3 The sorrows of death compassed
me, and the a pains of b hell gat hold
upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.
4 Then called I upon the name of
the Lord; O Lord, I beseech thee,
deliver my soul.
5 Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; yea, our God is a merciful.
6 The Lord preserveth the a simple:
I was brought low, and he helped me.
7 Return unto thy rest, O my soul;
for the Lord hath dealt bountifully
with thee.
8 For thou hast a delivered my b soul
from death, mine eyes from tears,
and my feet from falling.
9 I will walk before the Lord in
the a land of the living.
10 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:
11 I said in my a haste, All men
are liars.
12 What shall I a render unto the
Lord for all his benefits toward me?
13 I will take the cup of salvation,
and call upon the name of the Lord.
14 I will pay my vows unto the
Lord now in the presence of all
his people.
15 Precious in the sight of the Lord
is the a death of his saints.
16 O Lord, truly I am thy a servant;
I am thy servant, and the son of
thine handmaid: thou hast loosed
my bonds.

9 It is better to trust in the Lord
than to put confidence in princes.
10 All nations compassed me
about: but in the name of the Lord
will I destroy them.
11 They compassed me about; yea,

I will praise the Lord:

endureth for ever: forsake not the

works of thine own hands.
Psalm 139
David says that the Lord knows all
man’s thoughts and doings—He asks,
Where can man go to escape from the
spirit and presence of the Lord?—Man
is fearfully and wonderfully made.
To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.

O Lord, thou hast a searched me,
and b known me.
2 Thou knowest my downsitting
and mine uprising, thou understandest my a thought afar off.
3 Thou compassest my path and
my lying down, and art a acquainted
with all my ways.
4 For there is not a word in my
tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether.
5 Thou hast beset me behind and
before, and laid thine hand upon
me.
6 Such a knowledge is too b wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot
attain unto it.
7 Whither shall I go from thy
a 
spirit? or whither shall I flee from
thy b presence?

art there: if I make my bed in a hell,

are both alike to thee.
13 For thou hast a possessed my

mother’s womb.
14 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my
soul knoweth right well.
15 My substance was not hid from
thee, when I was made in secret,
and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
16 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and
in thy a book all my members were
written, which in continuance were
fashioned, when as yet there was
none of them.

a 
thoughts unto me, O God! how

therefore, ye bloody men.

wickedly, and thine enemies take
thy name in b vain.

that hate thee? and am not I grieved
with those that rise up against
thee?

I count them mine enemies.

A Prayer when he was in the cave.

2 I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my

3 When my spirit was a  overwhelmed within me, then thou

4 I looked on my right hand, and

6 Which made heaven, and earth,
the sea, and all that therein is: which
keepeth truth for ever:
7 Which executeth judgment for
the a oppressed: which giveth food
to the hungry. The Lord looseth
the prisoners:
8 The Lord openeth the a eyes of the
b 
blind: the Lord raiseth them that
are bowed down: the Lord loveth
the righteous:
9 The Lord preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the a fatherless and

he turneth upside down.
10 The Lord shall reign for a ever,
even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the Lord.

is pleasant; and praise is comely.
2 The Lord doth build up Jerusalem: he a gathereth together the

outcasts of Israel.
3 He healeth the broken in heart,
and bindeth up their wounds.
4 He telleth the number of the
a 
stars; he calleth them all by their

names.
5 Great is our Lord, and of great
power: his a understanding is infinite.
6 The Lord lifteth up the meek:
he casteth the wicked down to the

8 Who covereth the heaven with
clouds, who prepareth rain for the
earth, who maketh a grass to grow
upon the mountains.
9 He giveth to the beast his food,
and to the young ravens which cry.
10 He delighteth not in the strength
of the horse: he taketh not pleasure
in the legs of a man.
11 The Lord taketh a pleasure in
them that fear him, in those that
hope in his mercy.
12 Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem;
praise thy God, O Zion.
13 For he hath strengthened the
bars of thy gates; he hath blessed
thy children within thee.
14 He maketh peace in thy borders,
and filleth thee with the finest of
the wheat.
15 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth
very swiftly.
16 He giveth snow like wool: he
scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.
17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?
18 He sendeth out his word, and
melteth them: he causeth his wind
to blow, and the waters flow.
19 He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments
unto Israel.
20 He hath not dealt so with any
nation: and as for his judgments,
they have not a known them. Praise
ye the Lord.

b 
wisdom, and the man that getteth
c

14 For the merchandise of it is
better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine
gold.
15 She is more precious than rubies:
and all the things thou canst desire
are not to be compared unto her.
16 Length of days is in her right
hand; and in her left hand a riches

17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.

that lay hold upon her: and happy
is every one that retaineth her.

a 
founded the earth; by b understanding hath he established the heavens.
20 By his knowledge the depths
are a broken up, and the clouds drop
down the dew.
21 ¶ My son, let not them depart

22 So shall they be life unto thy
soul, and a grace to thy neck.
23 Then shalt thou walk in thy
way safely, and thy foot shall not

shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie
down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.

neither of the desolation of the

Six things that the Lord hates are
named—Those who commit adultery
destroy their own souls.
My son, if thou a be surety for thy
friend, if thou hast stricken thy
hand with a stranger,
2 Thou art snared with the words
of thy mouth, thou art taken with
the words of thy mouth.
3 Do this now, my son, and deliver
thyself, when thou art come into
the hand of thy friend; go, a humble
thyself, and make sure thy friend.
4 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor
slumber to thine eyelids.
5 Deliver thyself as a roe from the
hand of the hunter, and as a bird from
the hand of the fowler.
6 ¶ Go to the a ant, thou b sluggard;
consider her ways, and be wise:
7 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
8 Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the
harvest.
9 How long wilt thou a sleep, O
sluggard? when wilt thou arise out
of thy sleep?
10 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber,
a little folding of the hands to sleep:
11 So shall thy poverty come as
one that travelleth, and thy want
as an armed man.
12 ¶ A naughty person, a wicked
man, walketh with a a  froward
mouth.
13 He winketh with his eyes, he
speaketh with his feet, he teacheth
with his fingers;
14 Frowardness is in his heart, he

16 ¶ These six things doth the Lord
hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:
17 A a proud look, a lying tongue,
and hands that shed innocent blood,
18 An a heart that deviseth wicked
imaginations, feet that be swift in
running to mischief,
19 A a false witness that speaketh
b 
lies, and he that soweth c discord
among brethren.
20 ¶ My son, keep thy a father’s
commandment, and forsake not the
law of thy mother:
21 a Bind them continually upon
thine heart, and tie them about
thy neck.
22 When thou goest, it shall lead
thee; when thou sleepest, it shall
keep thee; and when thou awakest,
it shall talk with thee.
23 For the commandment is a a lamp;
and the law is light; and reproofs of
instruction are the way of life:
24 To keep thee from the a evil
b 
woman, from the flattery of the
tongue of a strange woman.
25 a Lust not after her beauty in
thine heart; neither let her take
thee with her eyelids.
26 For by means of a whorish
woman a man is brought to a piece
of bread: and the adulteress will
hunt for the precious life.
27 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
28 Can one go upon hot coals, and
his feet not be burned?
29 So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her
shall not be innocent.

10 And, behold, there met him a
woman with the attire of an a harlot,
and subtil of heart.
11 (She is loud and a stubborn; her
feet abide not in her house:
12 Now is she without, now in the
streets, and lieth in wait at a every
corner.)
13 So she caught him, and kissed
him, and with an impudent face
said unto him,
14 a I have peace offerings with
me; this day have I payed my vows.

thee, diligently to seek thy face, and
I have found thee.
16 I have decked my bed with

works, with fine linen of Egypt.

myrrh, a aloes, and cinnamon.

he is gone a long journey:
20 He hath taken a bag of money
with him, and will come home at
the day appointed.
21 With her much fair speech she
caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.

the stocks;
23 Till a dart strike through his
liver; as a bird hasteth to the a snare,
and knoweth not that it is for his

do I hate.
14 Counsel is mine, and sound
wisdom: I am understanding; I have

love me to inherit substance; and
I will fill their treasures.

24 When there were no depths,
I was brought forth; when there

Chapter 13
The way of the transgressor is hard—
Evil pursues sinners—He who does
not discipline his children hates them.
A wise son heareth his father’s instruction: but a scorner heareth
not rebuke.
2 A man shall eat good by the
fruit of his mouth: but the soul of
the transgressors shall eat violence.
3 He that keepeth his a  mouth
keepeth his life: but he that openeth
wide his b lips shall have destruction.
4 The soul of the a sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul
of the diligent shall be made fat.
5 A righteous man a hateth lying:
but a wicked man is loathsome, and
cometh to shame.
6 a Righteousness keepeth him that
is upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner.
7 There is that maketh himself
a 
rich, yet hath nothing: there is that
maketh himself poor, yet hath great
b 
riches.
8 The ransom of a man’s life are
his riches: but the poor heareth
not rebuke.
9 The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the a lamp of the wicked
shall be put out.
10 Only by a pride cometh b contention: but with the well advised
is wisdom.
11 a Wealth gotten by b vanity shall
be diminished: but he that gathereth
by c labour shall increase.
12 Hope deferred maketh the heart
sick: but when the desire cometh, it
is a tree of life.
13 Whoso a despiseth the word shall
be destroyed: but he that feareth the
commandment shall be b rewarded.

It is better to get wisdom than gold—

though hand join in hand, he shall
not be unpunished.
6 By mercy and truth iniquity is
purged: and by the a fear of the Lord
men b depart from c evil.

Lord, he maketh even his a enemies
to be at b peace with him.

right.

17 The highway of the upright is
to depart from evil: he that keepeth

spirit with the lowly, than to divide

prudent: and the sweetness of the

27 An ungodly man diggeth up
evil: and in his lips there is as a

28 A froward man soweth a strife:
and a whisperer separateth chief

29 A violent man enticeth his
neighbour, and leadeth him into

30 He shutteth his eyes to devise

2 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may
discover itself.
3 When the wicked cometh, then
cometh also contempt, and with
ignominy reproach.
4 The words of a man’s mouth are
as deep a waters, and the wellspring
of wisdom as a flowing brook.
5 It is not good to accept the a person of the wicked, to overthrow the
righteous in judgment.
6 A fool’s lips enter into a contention, and his mouth calleth for
strokes.
7 A fool’s a mouth is his b destruction, and his lips are the snare of
his soul.
8 The words of a a talebearer are
as wounds, and they go down into
the innermost parts of the belly.
9 He also that is a slothful in his
work is brother to him that is a

it, and is safe.
11 The a rich man’s b wealth is his
strong city, and as an high wall in
his own conceit.
12 Before destruction the heart of
man is a haughty, and before honour
is b humility.
13 He that a answereth a matter
before he heareth it, it is folly and

his infirmity; but a wounded spirit
who can bear?

Proverbs 20:24–21:18

24 Man’s a goings are of the Lord;
how can a man then understand
his own way ?
25 It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after
vows to make inquiry.
26 A wise a  king scattereth the
wicked, and bringeth the wheel
over them.
27 The spirit of man is the candle
of the Lord, searching all the inward parts of the belly.
28 Mercy and truth preserve the
king: and his throne is upholden
by mercy.
29 The a glory of young men is
their strength: and the b beauty of
c 
old men is the d gray head.
30 The blueness of a wound
cleanseth away evil: so do a stripes
the inward parts of the belly.
Chapter 21
Do righteousness and justice—Follow
after righteousness and mercy—Safety
comes from the Lord.
The a king’s heart is in the hand of
the Lord, as the rivers of water: he
turneth it whithersoever he will.
2 Every way of a man is right in
his a own eyes: but the Lord b pondereth the c hearts.
3 To do justice and judgment is
more acceptable to the Lord than
a 
sacrifice.
4 a An high look, and a b proud heart,
and c the plowing of the wicked,
is sin.
5 The thoughts of the diligent tend
only to plenteousness; but of every
one that is a hasty only to want.

A good name is better than riches—
Train up a child in the way he should go.
A good a name is rather to be chosen than great b riches, and loving favour rather than silver and
gold.
2 The a rich and poor meet together:
the Lord is the maker of them all.
3 A a prudent man foreseeth the
evil, and hideth himself: but the
simple pass on, and are punished.
4 By a humility and the b fear of
the Lord are riches, and honour,

of the a froward: he that doth keep
his soul shall be far from them.
6 a Train up a b child in the way he
should go: and when he is old, he
will not depart from it.

8 He that a soweth iniquity shall
b 
reap vanity: and the rod of his
anger shall fail.
9 He that hath a bountiful eye
shall be blessed; for he giveth of
his a bread to the b poor.
10 Cast out the scorner, and a contention shall go out; yea, b strife and
reproach shall cease.
11 He that loveth pureness of
heart, for the grace of his lips the
king shall be his friend.

6 Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in

Chapter 26
Honor is not fitting for a fool—Answer not a fool according to his folly—
Where there is no talebearer, the strife
ceases.
As snow in summer, and as rain in
harvest, so a honour is not seemly
for a fool.
2 As the bird by wandering, as
the swallow by flying, so the curse
causeless shall not come.

4 Answer not a fool according to
his folly, lest thou also be like unto
him.
5 a Answer a fool according to his
folly, lest he be wise in his b own

6 He that sendeth a message by
the hand of a fool cutteth off the
feet, and drinketh a damage.
7 The legs of the lame are not
equal: so is a parable in the mouth
of fools.
8 As he that bindeth a stone in a
sling, so is he that giveth honour
to a fool.
9 As a thorn goeth up into the
hand of a drunkard, so is a parable
in the mouth of fools.
10 The great God that formed all
things both a rewardeth the fool, and
rewardeth transgressors.

from off the earth, and the needy
from among men.
15 The a  horseleach hath two
daughters, crying, Give, give. There
are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is
enough:
16 The grave; and the barren
womb; the earth that is not filled
with water; and the fire that saith
not, It is enough.
17 The eye that mocketh at his
father, and despiseth to obey his
mother, the ravens of the valley
shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.
18 There be three things which are
too wonderful for me, yea, four
which I know not:
19 The way of an eagle in the air;
the way of a serpent upon a rock; the
way of a ship in the midst of the sea;
and the way of a man with a maid.
20 Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth
her a mouth, and saith, I have done
no wickedness.
21 For three things the earth is
disquieted, and for four which it
cannot bear:
22 For a a servant when he reigneth;
and a fool when he is filled with
meat;
23 For an odious woman when she
is married; and an handmaid that
is heir to her mistress.
24 There be four things which are
little upon the earth, but they are
exceeding wise:
25 The a  ants are a people not
strong, yet they prepare their meat
in the summer;
26 The a conies are but a feeble
folk, yet make they their houses
in the rocks;
27 The locusts have no king, yet
go they forth all of them by bands;
28 The spider taketh hold with
her hands, and is in kings’ palaces.
	15	a	 ie  a blood-sucking
parasite which is
seemingly never
satiated.
	20	a	 1 Jn. 1:8 (8–10).
	22	a	 Prov. 19:10.

29 There be three things which go
well, yea, four are comely in going:
30 A lion which is strongest among
beasts, and turneth not away for any;
31 A a greyhound; an he goat also;
and a king, against whom there is
no rising up.
32 If thou hast done foolishly in
lifting up thyself, or if thou hast
thought evil, lay thine hand upon
thy mouth.
33 Surely the churning of milk
bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood:
so the forcing of wrath bringeth
forth a strife.

Wine and strong drink are condemned—
Plead the cause of the poor and needy—A
virtuous woman is more precious than
rubies.

2 What, my son? and what, the son
of my womb? and what, the son of
my vows?
3 Give not thy strength unto
a 
women, nor thy ways to that which
destroyeth kings.
4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it
is not for kings to drink a wine; nor
for princes strong drink:
5 Lest they drink, and forget the
law, and pervert the judgment of
any of the afflicted.
6 Give strong drink unto him that
is ready to perish, and wine unto
those that be of heavy hearts.
7 Let him drink, and forget his
poverty, and remember his misery
no more.
8 Open thy mouth for the dumb
in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.

poor and needy.

11 The heart of her husband doth
safely a trust in her, so that he shall
have no need of spoil.
12 She will do him good and not
evil all the days of her life.
13 She seeketh wool, and flax,
and worketh willingly with her
a 
hands.
14 She is like the merchants’ ships;
she bringeth her food from afar.
15 She a riseth also while it is yet
night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.
16 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands
she planteth a vineyard.
17 She girdeth her loins with
strength, and strengtheneth her
arms.
18 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth
not out by night.
19 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the a distaff.
20 She stretcheth out her hand to
the a poor; yea, she reacheth forth
her hands to the needy.
21 She is not afraid of the snow for
b 

her household: for all her household
are clothed with scarlet.
22 She maketh herself coverings
of tapestry; her a clothing is silk
and purple.
23 Her husband is known in the
gates, when he sitteth among the
elders of the land.
24 She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto
the merchant.
25 Strength and honour are her
a 
clothing; and she shall rejoice in
time to come.
26 She openeth her mouth with
wisdom; and in her tongue is the
law of a kindness.
27 She looketh well to the ways of
her household, and eateth not the
bread of a idleness.
28 Her children arise up, and call
her blessed; her husband also, and
he praiseth her.
29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.
30 Favour is deceitful, and a beauty
is vain: but a woman that b feareth
the Lord, she shall be praised.
31 Give her of the fruit of her
hands; and let her own works praise
her in the gates.

3 What a profit hath a man of all
his labour which he taketh under
the sun?
4 One generation passeth away, and
another generation cometh: but the
a 
earth abideth for ever.
5 The sun also ariseth, and the
sun goeth down, and hasteth to his
place where he arose.
6 The wind goeth toward the south,
and turneth about unto the north;
it whirleth about continually, and
the wind returneth again according
to a his circuits.
7 All the rivers run into the sea;
yet the sea is not full; unto the
place from whence the rivers come,
thither they return again.
8 All things are full of labour; man
cannot utter it: the eye is not a satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled
with hearing.
9 The thing that hath been, it is
that which shall be; and that which
is done is that which shall be done:
and there is no a new thing under
the sun.
10 Is there any thing whereof it
may be said, See, this is new? it hath
been already of old time, which
was before us.
11 There is no a remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any
remembrance of things that are to
come with those that shall come after.
12 ¶ I the Preacher was king over
Israel in Jerusalem.
13 And I gave my heart to seek
and search out by a wisdom concerning all things that are done under
heaven: this b sore travail hath God
given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.
14 I have seen all the works that
are done under the sun; and, behold,

wisdom than all they that have been

heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
17 And I gave my a heart to know

3 I sought in mine heart to give
myself unto wine, yet acquainting
mine heart with wisdom; and to
lay hold on folly, till I might see
what was that good for the sons of
men, which they should do under
the heaven all the days of their
life.
4 I made me great works; I a builded

Ecclesiastes 2:7–26

7 I got me servants and maidens,
and had servants born in my house;
also I had great possessions of great
and small cattle above all that were
in Jerusalem before me:
8 I gathered me also silver and
a 
gold, and the peculiar treasure of
kings and of the b provinces: I gat
me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of
men, as musical instruments, and
that of all sorts.
9 So I was great, and increased
more than all that were before me
in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.
10 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for
my heart rejoiced in all my labour:
and this was my portion of all my
a 
labour.
11 Then I looked on all the works
that my hands had wrought, and on
the labour that I had laboured to
do: and, behold, all was vanity and
vexation of spirit, and there was no
profit under the sun.
12 ¶ And I turned myself to behold
wisdom, and madness, and folly: for
what can the man do that cometh
after the king? even that which hath
been already done.
13 Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth
a 
darkness.
14 The wise man’s eyes are in his
head; but the fool walketh in a darkness: and I myself perceived also that
one b event happeneth to them all.
15 Then said I in my heart, As it
happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was
I then more a wise? Then I said in
my heart, that this also is vanity.
16 For there is no a remembrance
of the wise more than of the fool
for ever; seeing that which now
is in the days to come shall all be

forgotten. And how b dieth the wise
man? as the fool.
17 Therefore I hated life; because
the work that is wrought under the
sun is grievous unto me: for all is
vanity and a vexation of spirit.
18 ¶ Yea, I hated all my labour
which I had taken under the sun:
because I should leave it unto the
man that shall be after me.
19 And who knoweth whether he
shall be a wise man or a fool? yet
shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and
wherein I have shewed myself wise
under the sun. This is also vanity.
20 Therefore I went about to cause
my heart to a despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.
21 For there is a man whose labour
is in wisdom, and in knowledge,
and in a equity; yet to a man that
hath not laboured therein shall he
leave it for his portion. This also is
b 
vanity and a great evil.
22 For what hath man of all his
labour, and of the vexation of his
heart, wherein he hath laboured
under the sun?
23 For all his days are sorrows,
and his travail grief; yea, his heart
taketh not rest in the night. This is
also vanity.
24 ¶ There is nothing better for a
man, than that he should eat and
drink, and that he should make
his a soul enjoy good in his b labour.
This also I saw, that it was from the
hand of God.
25 For who can eat, or who else
can hasten hereunto, more than I?
26 For God giveth to a man that
is good in his sight wisdom, and
knowledge, and joy: but to the
sinner he giveth travail, to gather
and to heap up, that he may give
to him that is a good before God.
This also is vanity and vexation of
spirit.

Chapter 3
To every thing there is a season—
Whatever God does, it will be forever—
God will judge the righteous and the
wicked.
To every thing there is a a season, and
a b time to every purpose under the
heaven:
2 A a time to be born, and a time
to b die; a time to plant, and a time
to pluck up that which is planted;
3 A time to kill, and a time to heal;
a time to break down, and a time

4 A time to weep, and a time to

God hath given to the sons of men
to be b exercised in it.
11 He hath made every thing a beautiful in his time: also b he hath set

them, but for a man to rejoice, and
to do a good in his life.
13 And also that every man should
eat and drink, and enjoy the good of
all his labour, it is the a gift of God.
14 I know that, whatsoever God
doeth, it shall be a for b ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing
taken from it: and God doeth it,
that men should c fear before him.
15 That which hath been is a now;
and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that
which is past.
16 ¶ And moreover I saw under
the sun the place of judgment,
that a wickedness was there; and the
place of righteousness, that iniquity
was there.
17 I said in mine heart, God shall
a 
judge the righteous and the wicked:
for there is a time there for every
purpose and for every work.
18 I said in mine heart concerning
the a estate of the sons of men, that
God might manifest them, and that
they might see that they themselves
are b beasts.
19 For that which a befalleth the
sons of men befalleth beasts; even
one thing befalleth them: as the
one dieth, so dieth the other; yea,
they have all one breath; so that a
man hath no preeminence above a
beast: for all is vanity.

21 Who knoweth the spirit of man
that goeth upward, and the spirit
of the beast that goeth downward
to the earth?

Chapter 4
Oppression and evil deeds are vanity—The strength of two is better than
one—Better is a poor and wise child
than an old and foolish king.
So I returned, and considered all
the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears
of such as were oppressed, and they
had no comforter; and on the side
of their oppressors there was power;
but they had no comforter.
2 Wherefore I praised the dead
which are already dead more than
the living which are yet alive.
3 Yea, better is he than both they,
which hath not yet been, who hath
not seen the evil work that is done
under the sun.
4 ¶ Again, I considered all travail,
and every right work, that for this
a man is a envied of his neighbour.
This is also vanity and b vexation
of spirit.
5 The a fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.
6 Better is an a handful with b quietness, than both the hands full
with travail and vexation of spirit.
7 ¶ Then I returned, and I saw
a 
vanity under the sun.
8 There is one alone, and there is
not a second; yea, he hath neither
child nor brother: yet is there no
end of all his labour; neither is his
eye satisfied with riches; neither
saith he, For whom do I labour, and
a 
bereave my soul of good? This is
also vanity, yea, it is a b sore travail.

their labour.

is alone when he falleth; for he hath
not another to help him up.
11 Again, if two lie together, then
they have heat: but how can one be
warm alone?
12 And if one prevail against him,
two shall withstand him; and a
threefold cord is not quickly broken.
13 ¶ Better is a a poor and a wise
child than an old and foolish king,
who will no more be b admonished.
14 For out of prison he cometh to
reign; whereas also he that is born
in his kingdom becometh poor.
15 I considered all the living which
walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in
his stead.
16 There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after
shall not rejoice in him. Surely
this also is vanity and vexation of
spirit.

850

5 Better is it that thou shouldest
not vow, than that thou shouldest
a 
vow and not pay.
6 Suffer not thy mouth to cause
thy flesh to sin; neither say thou
before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry
at thy voice, and destroy the work
of thine hands?
7 For in the multitude of dreams
and many words there are also divers
a 
vanities: but b fear thou God.
8 ¶ If thou seest the a oppression of
the poor, and violent perverting of
b 
judgment and justice in a province,
marvel not at the matter: for he that
is higher than the highest regardeth;
and there be higher than they.
9 ¶ Moreover the profit of the earth
is for all: the king himself is served
by the field.
10 He that loveth a silver shall not
be satisfied with silver; nor he that
loveth abundance with increase:
this is also b vanity.
11 When goods increase, they are
increased that eat them: and what
good is there to the owners thereof,
saving the beholding of them with
their eyes?
12 The a sleep of a b labouring man
is sweet, whether he eat little or
much: but the abundance of the
rich will not suffer him to sleep.
13 There is a a sore evil which I
have seen under the sun, namely,
riches kept for the owners thereof
to their hurt.
14 But those riches perish by evil
travail: and he begetteth a son, and
there is nothing in his hand.
15 As he came forth of his mother’s
womb, a naked shall he return to go
as he came, and shall take nothing
of his labour, which he may carry
away in his hand.

go: and what profit hath he that
hath laboured for the wind?
17 All his days also he eateth in
darkness, and he hath much sorrow
and wrath with his sickness.
18 ¶ Behold that which I have
seen: it is good and comely for one
to eat and to drink, and to enjoy
the good of all his a labour that he
taketh under the sun all the days
of his life, which God giveth him:
for it is his b portion.
19 Every man also to whom God
hath given a  riches and wealth,
and hath given him power to eat
thereof, and to take his portion,
and to rejoice in his b labour; this
is the c gift of God.
20 For he shall not much remember
the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart.
Chapter 6
Unless a man’s soul is filled with good,
his riches, wealth, honor, and posterity
are vanity.
There is an evil which I have seen
under the sun, and it is common
among men:
2 A man to whom God hath given
riches, wealth, and honour, so that
he wanteth nothing for his soul of
all that he desireth, yet God giveth
him not power to eat thereof, but
a stranger eateth it: this is vanity,
and it is an evil a disease.
3 ¶ If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that
the days of his years be many, and
his soul be not filled with good,
and also that he have no a burial; I
say, that an untimely birth is better than he.
4 For he cometh in a with vanity,
and departeth in darkness, and
his name shall be covered with
darkness.

5 Moreover he hath not seen the
sun, nor known any thing: this hath
more rest than the other.
6 ¶ Yea, though he live a thousand
years twice told, yet hath he seen
no good: do not all go to one place?
7 All the labour of man is for his
mouth, and yet the appetite is not
filled.
8 For what hath the wise more
than the fool? what hath the poor,
that knoweth to walk before the
living?
9 ¶ Better is the a sight of the eyes
than the wandering of the desire:
this is also b vanity and c vexation
of spirit.
10 That which hath been is named
already, and it is known that it is
man: neither may he a contend with
him that is mightier than he.
11 ¶ Seeing there be many things
that increase a vanity, what is man
the b better?
12 For who knoweth what is good
for man in this life, all the days of
his vain life which he spendeth as a
shadow? for who can tell a man what
shall be after him under the sun?
Chapter 7
Wisdom gives life to them that have
it—All men are sinners—God has made
man upright.
A good a name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death
than the day of one’s birth.
2 ¶ It is better to go to the house of
a 
mourning, than to go to the house
of feasting: for that is the end of
all men; and the living will lay it
to his heart.
3 Sorrow is better than laughter:
for by the a sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.

of the wise, than for a man to hear
the song of fools.
6 For as the crackling of thorns
under a pot, so is the a laughter of
the fool: this also is b vanity.
7 ¶ Surely oppression maketh a

8 Better is the end of a thing than

angry: for c anger resteth in the

11 ¶ Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to
them that see the sun.
12 For a wisdom is a b defence, and

he hath made crooked?

joyful, but in the day of a adversity

over against the other, to the end
that man should find nothing after him.
15 All things have I seen in the days
of my a vanity: there is a b just man
that perisheth in his righteousness,
and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.

neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?
18 It is good that thou shouldest
take hold of this; yea, also from this
withdraw not thine hand: for he
that a feareth God shall come forth
of them all.
19 a Wisdom b strengtheneth the
wise more than ten mighty men
which are in the city.
20 For there is not a a just man
upon earth, that doeth good, and

likewise hast cursed others.

was far from me.
24 That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?
25 I applied mine a heart to know,
and to search, and to seek out b wisdom, and the reason of things, and to
know the wickedness of folly, even
of foolishness and madness:
26 And I find more a bitter than
death the b woman, whose heart is

the a preacher, counting one by one,
to find out the account:

None have power to avoid death—It will
not be well with the wicked; he turns
to pleasure and cannot find wisdom.
Who is as the wise man? and who
knoweth the interpretation of a
thing? a man’s wisdom maketh his
face to a shine, and the boldness of
his face shall be changed.
2 I counsel thee to keep the a king’s
commandment, and that in regard
of the oath of God.
3 Be not hasty to go out of his
sight: stand not in an evil thing; for
he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.
4 Where the word of a king is, there
is power: and who may say unto
him, What doest thou?
5 Whoso keepeth the a commandment shall feel no evil thing: and
a wise man’s heart discerneth both
b 
time and judgment.
6 ¶ Because to every purpose there
is time and judgment, therefore the
misery of man is great upon him.
7 For he knoweth not that which
shall be: for who can tell him when
it shall be?
8 There is no man that hath power
over the spirit to retain the spirit;
neither hath he power in the day of
a 
death: and there is no discharge in
that war; neither shall wickedness
b 
deliver those that are given to it.
9 All this have I seen, and applied
my heart unto every work that is
done under the sun: there is a time
wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.
10 And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from
the place of the holy, and they were
forgotten in the city where they had
so done: this is also vanity.

therefore the heart of the sons of
men is fully b set in them to do evil.
12 ¶ Though a sinner do evil an
hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it
shall be a well with them that b fear
God, which fear before him:
13 But it shall not be well with the
wicked, neither shall he prolong his
days, which are as a shadow; because
he a feareth not before God.
14 There is a a vanity which is done
upon the earth; that there be b just
men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked;
again, there be wicked men, to whom
it happeneth according to the work
of the righteous: I said that this also
is vanity.
15 Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing
under the sun, than to eat, and to
drink, and to be merry: for that
shall abide with him of his labour
the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.
16 ¶ When I applied mine heart to
know a wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth:
(for also there is that neither day
nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)
17 Then I beheld all the work of
God, that a man cannot find out
the a work that is done under the
sun: because though a man labour
to seek it out, yet he shall not find
it; yea further; though a b wise man
think to know it, yet shall he not
be able to find it.

For all this I considered in my heart
even to declare all this, that the
righteous, and the wise, and their
works, are in the hand of God: no
man knoweth either love or hatred
by all that is before them.
2 All things come alike to all: there is
one a event to the b righteous, and to
the wicked; to the good and to the
clean, and to the unclean; to him
that sacrificeth, and to him that
sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is
the sinner; and he that c sweareth,
as he that d feareth an oath.
3 This is an evil among all things
that are done under the sun, that
there is one event unto all: yea, also
the heart of the sons of men is full
of evil, and madness is in their heart
while they live, and after that they
go to the a dead.
4 ¶ For to him that is joined to all
the living there is a hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
5 For the living know that they
shall die: but the dead know not
any thing, neither have they any
more a reward; for the memory of
them is forgotten.
6 Also their love, and their hatred,
and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion
for ever in any thing that is done
under the sun.
7 ¶ Go thy way, eat thy bread
with joy, and drink thy wine with
a a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.
8 Let thy garments be always
a 
white; and let thy head lack no
ointment.

10 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to
do, do it with thy a might; for there
is no work, nor device, nor b knowledge, nor wisdom, in the c grave,
whither thou goest.
11 ¶ I returned, and saw under
the sun, that the race is not to the
a 
swift, nor the battle to the strong,
neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet
riches to men of understanding, nor
yet favour to men of skill; but time
and chance happeneth to them all.
12 For man also knoweth not his
time: as the fishes that are taken
in an evil net, and as the birds that
are caught in the snare; so are the
sons of men a snared in an evil time,
when it falleth suddenly upon them.
13 ¶ This wisdom have I seen also
under the sun, and it seemed great
unto me:
14 There was a little city, and few
men within it; and there came a
great king against it, and besieged it,
and built great bulwarks against it:
15 Now there was found in it a
poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man
remembered that same poor man.
16 Then said I, a Wisdom is better
than strength: nevertheless the poor
man’s b wisdom is despised, and his
words are not heard.
17 The words of wise men are heard
in quiet more than the cry of him
that ruleth among fools.

of war: but one b sinner destroyeth
much good.

2 A wise man’s heart is at his right
hand; but a fool’s heart at his left.
3 Yea also, when he that is a fool
walketh by the way, his wisdom
faileth him, and he saith to every
one that he is a fool.
4 If the spirit of the ruler rise up
against thee, leave not thy place; for
yielding pacifieth great offences.
5 There is an evil which I have seen
under the sun, as an error which
proceedeth from the ruler:

the rich sit in low place.

not whet the edge, then must he
put to more strength: but wisdom
is profitable to direct.

without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.

of a b fool will swallow up himself.

man cannot tell what shall be; and
what shall be after him, who can
tell him?

knoweth not how to go to the city.

shall be a burden, and desire shall
fail: because man goeth to his long

the people knowledge; yea, he gave
good heed, and sought out, and set
in order many proverbs.

Chapter 3

Chapter 4

A love song concerning Solomon is
presented.

A song describes the beauty of the poet’s beloved.

By night on my bed I sought him
whom my soul loveth: I sought him,
but I found him not.
2 I will rise now, and go about
the city in the streets, and in the
broad ways I will seek him whom
my soul loveth: I sought him, but I
found him not.
3 The watchmen that go about the
city found me: to whom I said, Saw
ye him whom my soul loveth?
4 It was but a little that I passed
from them, but I found him whom
my soul loveth: I held him, and
would not let him go, until I had
brought him into my mother’s
house, and into the chamber of her
that conceived me.
5 I charge you, O ye daughters
of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by
the hinds of the field, that ye stir
not up, nor awake my love, till he
please.
6 ¶ Who is this that cometh out
of the wilderness like pillars of
smoke, perfumed with myrrh and
frankincense, with all powders of
the merchant?
7 Behold his bed, which is Solomon’s; threescore valiant men are
about it, of the valiant of Israel.
8 They all hold swords, being expert
in war: every man hath his sword
upon his thigh because of fear in
the night.
9 King Solomon made himself a
chariot of the wood of Lebanon.
10 He made the pillars thereof of
silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the
covering of it of purple, the midst
thereof being paved with love, for
the daughters of Jerusalem.
11 Go forth, O ye daughters of
Zion, and behold king Solomon with
the crown wherewith his mother
crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.

Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves’
eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as
a flock of goats, that appear from
mount Gilead.
2 Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep
that are even shorn, which came up
from the washing; whereof every
one bear twins, and none is barren
among them.
3 Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy
temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.
4 Thy neck is like the tower of
David builded for an armoury,
whereon there hang a thousand
bucklers, all shields of mighty men.
5 Thy two breasts are like two
young roes that are twins, which
feed among the lilies.
6 Until the day break, and the
shadows flee away, I will get me to
the mountain of myrrh, and to the
hill of frankincense.
7 Thou art all fair, my love; there
is no spot in thee.
8 ¶ Come with me from Lebanon,
my a spouse, with me from Lebanon:
look from the top of Amana, from the
top of Shenir and Hermon, from
the lions’ dens, from the mountains
of the leopards.
9 Thou hast ravished my heart,
a 
my b sister, my spouse; thou hast
ravished my heart with one of
thine eyes, with one chain of thy
neck.
10 How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is
thy love than wine! and the smell
of thine ointments than all spices!
11 Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as
the honeycomb: honey and milk
are under thy tongue; and the smell
of thy garments is like the smell of
Lebanon.
12 A garden inclosed is my sister,

my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
13 Thy plants are an orchard of
pomegranates, with pleasant fruits;
a

14 Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees
of frankincense; myrrh and aloes,
with all the chief spices:
15 A fountain of gardens, a well
of living waters, and streams from
Lebanon.
16 ¶ Awake, O north wind; and
come, thou south; blow upon my
garden, that the spices thereof may
flow out. Let my beloved come into
his garden, and eat his pleasant
fruits.
Chapter 5
The song of love and affection continues.
I am come into my garden, my a sister, my b spouse: I have gathered my
myrrh with my spice; I have eaten
my honeycomb with my honey; I
have drunk my wine with my milk:
eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink
abundantly, O beloved.
2 ¶ I sleep, but my heart waketh:
it is the voice of my beloved that
knocketh, saying, Open to me, my
sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with
dew, and my locks with the drops
of the night.
3 I have put off my coat; how shall
I put it on? I have washed my feet;
how shall I defile them?
4 My beloved put in his hand by
the hole of the door, and my bowels
were moved for him.
5 I rose up to open to my beloved;
and my hands dropped with myrrh,
and my fingers with sweet smelling
myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.
6 I opened to my beloved; but my
beloved had withdrawn himself,
and was gone: my soul failed when
he spake: I sought him, but I could
not find him; I called him, but he
gave me no answer.

7 The watchmen that went about

they wounded me; the keepers of the
walls took away my veil from me.
8 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that
ye tell him, that I am sick of love.
9 ¶ What is thy beloved more
than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved,
that thou dost so charge us?
10 My beloved is white and ruddy,
the chiefest among ten thousand.
11 His head is as the most fine
gold, his locks are bushy, and black
as a raven.
12 His eyes are as the eyes of doves
by the rivers of waters, washed with
milk, and fitly set.
13 His cheeks are as a bed of spices,
as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies,
dropping sweet smelling myrrh.
14 His hands are as gold rings set
with the beryl: his belly is as bright
ivory overlaid with sapphires.
15 His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold:
his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
16 His mouth is most sweet: yea,
he is altogether lovely. This is my
beloved, and this is my friend, O
daughters of Jerusalem.
Chapter 6
The song of love continues.
Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou
fairest among women? whither is
thy beloved turned aside? that we
may seek him with thee.
2 My beloved is gone down into his
garden, to the beds of spices, to feed
in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
3 I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among
the lilies.
4 ¶ Thou art beautiful, O my love,
as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.
5 Turn away thine eyes from me,

Song of Solomon 6:6–8:5
for they have overcome me: thy hair
is as a flock of goats that appear
from Gilead.
6 Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep
which go up from the washing,
whereof every one beareth twins,
and there is not one barren among
them.
7 As a piece of a pomegranate are
thy temples within thy locks.
8 There are threescore queens, and
fourscore concubines, and virgins
without number.
9 My dove, my undefiled is but one;
she is the only one of her mother,
she is the choice one of her that bare
her. The daughters saw her, and
blessed her; yea, the queens and the
concubines, and they praised her.
10 ¶ Who is she that looketh forth
as the morning, fair as the moon,
clear as the sun, and terrible as an
army with banners?
11 I went down into the garden of
nuts to see the fruits of the valley,
and to see whether the vine flourished, and the pomegranates budded.
12 Or ever I was aware, my soul
made me like the chariots of Amminadib.
13 Return, return, O Shulamite;
return, return, that we may look
upon thee. What will ye see in the
Shulamite? As it were the company
of two armies.
Chapter 7
The song of love continues.
How beautiful are thy feet with
shoes, O prince’s daughter! the
joints of thy thighs are like jewels,
the work of the hands of a cunning
workman.
2 Thy navel is like a round goblet,
which wanteth not liquor: thy belly
is like an heap of wheat set about
with lilies.
3 Thy two breasts are like two
young roes that are twins.
4 Thy neck is as a tower of ivory;
thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim:
thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon
which looketh toward Damascus.

860
5 Thine head upon thee is like
Carmel, and the hair of thine head
like purple; the king is held in the
galleries.
6 How fair and how pleasant art
thou, O love, for delights!
7 This thy stature is like to a palm
tree, and thy breasts to clusters of
grapes.
8 I said, I will go up to the palm
tree, I will take hold of the boughs
thereof: now also thy breasts shall
be as clusters of the vine, and the
smell of thy nose like apples;
9 And the roof of thy mouth like
the best wine for my beloved, that
goeth down sweetly, causing the lips
of those that are asleep to speak.
10 ¶ I am my beloved’s, and his
desire is toward me.
11 Come, my beloved, let us go
forth into the field; let us lodge in
the villages.
12 Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish,
whether the tender grape appear, and
the pomegranates bud forth: there
will I give thee my loves.
13 The mandrakes give a smell,
and at our gates are all manner of
pleasant fruits, new and old, which I
have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
Chapter 8
Many waters cannot quench love.
O that thou wert as my brother, that
sucked the breasts of my mother!
when I should find thee without, I
would kiss thee; yea, I should not
be despised.
2 I would lead thee, and bring thee
into my mother’s house, who would
instruct me: I would cause thee to
drink of spiced wine of the juice
of my pomegranate.
3 His left hand should be under my
head, and his right hand should
embrace me.
4 I charge you, O daughters of
Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor
awake my love, until he please.
5 Who is this that cometh up from
the wilderness, leaning upon her
beloved? I raised thee up under the

apple tree: there thy mother brought
thee forth: there she brought thee
forth that bare thee.
6 ¶ Set me as a seal upon thine
heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for
love is strong as death; jealousy is
a 
cruel as the grave: the coals thereof
are coals of fire, which hath a most
vehement flame.
7 Many waters cannot quench love,
neither can the floods drown it: if
a man would give all the substance
of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.
8 ¶ We have a little sister, and she
hath no breasts: what shall we do
for our sister in the day when she
shall be spoken for?
9 If she be a wall, we will build
upon her a palace of silver: and if

she be a door, we will inclose her
with boards of cedar.
10 I am a wall, and my breasts like
towers: then was I in his eyes as one
that found favour.
11 Solomon had a vineyard at
Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for
the fruit thereof was to bring a
thousand pieces of silver.
12 My vineyard, which is mine, is
before me: thou, O Solomon, must
have a thousand, and those that
keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
13 Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to
thy voice: cause me to hear it.
14 ¶ Make haste, my beloved, and
be thou like to a roe or to a young

hart upon the mountains of spices.

shalt be called, The c city of righteousness, the faithful city.
27 a Zion shall be redeemed with

judgment, and her c converts with

28 ¶ And the destruction of the
transgressors and of the sinners
shall be together, and they that forsake the Lord shall be consumed.
29 For they shall be ashamed of
the a oaks which ye have desired,
and ye shall be confounded for the
gardens that ye have chosen.

say, Come ye, and let us a go up to

will d teach us of his ways, and we
will walk in his paths: for out of

Zion shall go forth the f law, and the
word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
4 And he shall a judge among the
nations, and shall rebuke many
people: and they shall beat their
swords into plowshares, and their
spears into pruninghooks: nation
shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn b war

a 
Now will I b sing to my wellbeloved

vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a
vineyard d in a very fruitful hill:
2 And he fenced it, and gathered
out the stones thereof, and planted
it with the choicest vine, and built
a tower in the midst of it, and also
made a winepress therein: and he
looked that it should bring forth
grapes, and it brought forth wild
grapes.
3 And now, O inhabitants of
Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge,
I pray you, betwixt me and my
vineyard.
4 What could have been done more
to my vineyard, that I have not done
in it? wherefore, when I looked that
it should bring forth grapes, brought
it forth a wild grapes?
5 And now go to; I will tell you
what I will do to my a vineyard: I
will b take away the hedge thereof,
and it shall be eaten up; and break
down the c wall thereof, and it shall
be trodden down:
6 And I will lay it waste: it shall
not be pruned, nor digged; but there
shall come up briers and thorns: I
will also command the clouds that
they rain no rain upon it.
7 For the a vineyard of the Lord of
hosts is the house of Israel, and the
men of Judah his pleasant plant:
and he looked for b judgment, but
behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold c a cry.

Isaiah 6:3–7:3

each one had six wings; with twain
he covered his face, and with twain
he covered his feet, and with twain
he did fly.
3 And one cried unto another, and
said, Holy, holy, holy, is the a Lord
of hosts: the whole earth is full of
his b glory.
4 And the a posts of the door moved
at the voice of him that cried, and
the house was filled with b smoke.
5 ¶ Then said I, Woe is me! for I
am a undone; because I am a man
of b unclean lips, and I dwell in the
midst of a people of unclean lips:
for mine eyes have c seen the d King,
the Lord of hosts.
6 Then flew one of the seraphims
unto me, having a live a coal in his
hand, which he had taken with the
tongs from off the altar:
7 And he laid it upon my a mouth,
and said, Lo, this hath touched thy
lips; and thine iniquity is b taken
away, and thy sin purged.
8 Also I heard the voice of the
Lord, saying, Whom shall I a send,
and who will go for us? Then said
I, Here am I; b send me.

and be quiet; fear not, neither be
fainthearted for the two tails of
these smoking firebrands, for the
fierce anger of Rezin with Syria,
and of the son of Remaliah.
5 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the
son of Remaliah, have taken evil
counsel against thee, saying,
6 Let us go up against Judah, and
vex it, and let us a make a breach
therein for us, and set a king in the
midst of it, even the son of Tabeal:
7 Thus saith the Lord God, It shall

Rezin; and within threescore and

9 And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. a If ye will not believe,

Babylon is fallen, is fallen!—Other
nations also are destroyed.
The a burden of the desert of the
sea. As whirlwinds in b the south
pass through; so it cometh from the
desert, from a terrible land.
2 A grievous vision is declared unto
me; the a treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler
spoileth. Go up, O b Elam: besiege, O
Media; all the sighing thereof have
I made to cease.
3 Therefore are my loins filled
with pain: pangs have taken hold
upon me, as the pangs of a woman
that travaileth: I was bowed down
at the hearing of it; I was a dismayed
at the seeing of it.
4 My heart panted, fearfulness
affrighted me: the night of my
pleasure hath he turned into fear
unto me.
5 Prepare the table, watch in the
watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye
princes, and anoint the shield.
6 For thus hath the Lord said unto
me, Go, set a watchman, let him
a 
declare what he seeth.
7 And he saw a chariot with a couple
of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a
chariot of camels; and he hearkened
diligently with much heed:
8 And he cried, A lion: My lord, I
stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set
in my ward whole nights:

from the drawn sword, and from

unto me, Within a year, according

hosts, Go, get thee unto this treasurer, even unto a Shebna, which is
over the house, and say,
16 What hast thou here? and whom
hast thou here, that thou hast hewed
thee out a sepulchre here, as he that
heweth him out a sepulchre on high,

thee away with a mighty captivity,
and will surely cover thee.
18 He will surely violently turn
and toss thee like a ball into a large

there the chariots of thy glory shall

11 For with stammering lips and

this people.
12 To whom he said, This is the rest

14 ¶ Wherefore hear the word of
the Lord, ye scornful men, that rule
this people which is in Jerusalem.
15 Because ye have said, We have
made a covenant with death, and
with hell are we at agreement; when
the overflowing a scourge shall pass
through, it shall not come unto us:
for we have made lies our b refuge,
and under falsehood have we hid
ourselves:

God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a

the refuge of lies, and the waters
shall overflow the hiding place.

death shall be disannulled, and

shall pass through, then ye shall be

7 For the a Egyptians shall help in

have I cried concerning this, Their

8 ¶ Now go, a write it before them
in a table, and note it in a book,
that it may be for the time to come

9 That a this is a b rebellious people, lying children, children that
will not hear the law of the Lord:

11 Get you out of the way, turn aside
out of the path, cause the Holy One

12 Wherefore thus saith the Holy

25 And there shall be upon every

when the towers fall.
26 Moreover the light of the moon

the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days,
in the day that the Lord bindeth

27 ¶ Behold, the a name of the
Lord cometh from far, burning
with his b anger, and the burden
thereof is heavy: his lips are full of
indignation, and his tongue as a
devouring fire:
28 And his a breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst
of the b neck, to sift the nations with
the sieve of c vanity: and there shall
be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.

kept; and gladness of heart, as when

Chapter 36
The Assyrians war against Judah and
blaspheme the Lord.
Now it came to pass in the a fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that
Sennacherib king of b Assyria came
up against all the defenced cities
of Judah, and took them.
2 And the king of Assyria sent
a 
Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a
great army. And he stood by the
conduit of the upper pool in the
highway of the fuller’s field.
3 Then came forth unto him
Eliakim, Hilkiah’s son, which was
over the house, and Shebna the
scribe, and Joah, Asaph’s son, the
recorder.
4 ¶ And Rabshakeh said unto them,
Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith
the great king, the king of Assyria,
What confidence is this wherein
thou trustest?
5 I say, sayest thou, (but they are
but vain words) I have counsel and
strength for war: now on whom
dost thou trust, that thou rebellest
against me?
6 Lo, thou trustest in the staff of
this broken a reed, on b Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his
hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh
king of Egypt to all that trust in him.
7 But if thou say to me, We trust
in the Lord our God: is it not he,
whose a high places and whose altars
Hezekiah hath taken away, and said

to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall
worship before this altar?
8 Now therefore give pledges, I
pray thee, to my master the king
of Assyria, and I will give thee two
thousand horses, if thou be able on
thy part to set riders upon them.
9 How then wilt thou turn away
the face of one captain of the least
of my master’s servants, and put thy
trust on Egypt for chariots and for
horsemen?
10 And am I now come up without
the Lord against this land to destroy
it? the Lord said unto me, Go up
against this land, and destroy it.
11 ¶ Then said Eliakim and Shebna
and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I
pray thee, unto thy servants in the
a 
Syrian language; for we understand
it: and speak not to us in the Jews’
language, in the ears of the people
that are on the wall.
12 ¶ But Rabshakeh said, Hath my
master sent me to thy master and
to thee to speak these words? hath
he not sent me to the men that sit
upon the wall, that they may eat
their own dung, and drink their
own piss with you?
13 Then Rabshakeh stood, and
cried with a loud voice in the Jews’
language, and said, Hear ye the
words of the great king, the king
of Assyria.
14 Thus saith the king, Let not
Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall
not be able to deliver you.
15 Neither let Hezekiah make you
trust in the Lord, saying, The Lord
will surely deliver us: this city shall
not be delivered into the hand of

one the waters of his own cistern;
17 Until I come and take you away
to a land like your own land, a land
of corn and wine, a land of bread
and vineyards.
18 Beware lest Hezekiah persuade
you, saying, The Lord will deliver
us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the
hand of the king of Assyria?
19 Where are the gods of Hamath
and Arphad? where are the gods
of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered a Samaria out of my hand?
20 Who are they among all the gods
of these lands, that have delivered
their land out of my hand, that the
Lord should deliver Jerusalem out
of my hand?
21 But they a held their peace, and
answered him not a word: for the
king’s commandment was, saying,
Answer him not.
22 ¶ Then came Eliakim, the son of
Hilkiah, that was over the household,
and Shebna the scribe, and Joah,
the son of Asaph, the recorder, to
Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and
told him the words of Rabshakeh.
Chapter 37
Hezekiah seeks counsel from Isaiah to
save Jerusalem—Isaiah prophesies the
defeat of the Assyrians and the death
of Sennacherib—Hezekiah prays for
deliverance—Sennacherib sends a blasphemous letter—Isaiah prophesies that
the Assyrians will be destroyed and that
a remnant of Judah will flourish—An
angel slays 185,000 Assyrians—Sennacherib is slain by his sons.
And it came to pass, when king
Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his
clothes, and covered himself with
sackcloth, and went into the house
of the Lord.
2 And he sent Eliakim, who was
over the household, and Shebna the
scribe, and the elders of the priests
	19	a	 ie  the capital of
northern Israel (ten
tribes), which had
already been captured.

covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah
the prophet the son of Amoz.
3 And they said unto him, Thus
saith Hezekiah, This day is a day
of a trouble, and of rebuke, and of
b 
blasphemy: for the children are
come to c the birth, and there is not
strength to bring forth.
4 It may be the Lord thy God will
hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom
the king of Assyria his master hath
sent to reproach the living God, and
will reprove the words which the
Lord thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.
5 So the servants of king Hezekiah
came to Isaiah.
6 ¶ And a Isaiah said unto them,
Thus shall ye say unto your master,
Thus saith the Lord, Be not afraid
of the words that thou hast heard,
wherewith the servants of the king
of Assyria have blasphemed me.
7 Behold, I will a send a blast upon
him, and he shall hear a b rumour,
and return to his own land; and I
will cause him to fall by the sword
in his own land.
8 ¶ So Rabshakeh returned, and
found the king of Assyria warring
against Libnah: for he had heard
that he was departed from Lachish.
9 And he heard say concerning
Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is
come forth to make war with thee.
And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
10 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah
king of Judah, saying, Let not thy
God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall
not be given into the hand of the
king of Assyria.
11 Behold, thou hast heard what
the kings of Assyria have done to
all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?

13 Where is the king of Hamath,
and the king of Arphad, and the
king of the city of Sepharvaim,
Hena, and Ivah?
14 ¶ And Hezekiah received the
letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went
up unto the house of the Lord, and
spread it before the Lord.
15 And Hezekiah prayed unto the
Lord, saying,
16 O Lord of hosts, God of Israel,
that dwellest between the a cherubims,
thou art the God, even thou alone,
of all the kingdoms of the earth:
thou hast made heaven and earth.
17 Incline thine ear, O Lord, and
hear; open thine eyes, O Lord,
and see: and hear all the words of
Sennacherib, which hath sent to
a 
reproach the living God.
18 Of a truth, Lord, the kings of
Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their a countries,
19 And have cast their gods into
the fire: for they were no a gods, but
the work of men’s hands, wood
and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.
20 Now therefore, O Lord our God,
save us from his hand, that all the
kingdoms of the earth may know that
thou art the Lord, even thou only.
21 ¶ Then Isaiah the son of Amoz
sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus
saith the Lord God of Israel,
Whereas thou hast prayed to me
against Sennacherib king of Assyria:
22 This is the word which the Lord
hath spoken concerning him; a The
virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath
despised thee, and laughed thee to
scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem
hath shaken her head at thee.
23 Whom hast thou reproached

whom hast thou exalted thy voice,
and lifted up thine eyes on high?

cedars thereof, and the choice fir
trees thereof: and I will enter into
the height of his border, and the
forest of his Carmel.
25 I have digged, and drunk water;
and with the sole of my feet have
I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.
26 Hast thou not heard long ago,
how a I have done it; and of ancient
times, that I have formed it? now
have I brought it to pass, that thou
shouldest be to lay waste defenced

27 Therefore their inhabitants were

33 Therefore thus saith the Lord
concerning the king of Assyria, He
shall not come into this city, nor
shoot an arrow there, nor come
before it with shields, nor cast a
a 
bank against it.
34 By the way that he came, by the
same shall he return, and shall not
come into this city, saith the Lord.
35 For I will a defend this city to
save it for mine own sake, and for
my servant David’s sake.
36 Then the a angel of the Lord
went forth, and smote in the camp of
the b  Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when
c 
they arose early in the morning,
behold, they were all dead corpses.
37 ¶ So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
38 And it came to pass, as he was
worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech
and Sharezer his sons smote him
with the sword; and they escaped
into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.
Chapter 38
Hezekiah’s life is lengthened fifteen
years—The sun goes back ten degrees
as a sign—Hezekiah praises and thanks
the Lord.
In those days was a Hezekiah sick
unto death. And Isaiah the prophet
the son of Amoz came unto him,
and said unto him, Thus saith the
Lord, Set thine house in order: for
thou shalt die, and not live.
2 Then Hezekiah turned his face
toward the wall, and prayed unto
the Lord,

Lord, I beseech thee, how I have
walked before thee in truth and
with a perfect heart, and have done

that which is good in thy sight. And
Hezekiah wept sore.
4 ¶ Then came the word of the
Lord to Isaiah, saying,
5 Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus
saith the Lord, the God of David
thy father, I have heard thy prayer,
I have seen thy tears: behold, I will
a 
add unto thy days fifteen years.
6 And I will deliver thee and this
city out of the hand of the king of
Assyria: and I will a defend this city.
7 And this shall be a sign unto thee
from the Lord, that the Lord will
do this thing that he hath spoken;

returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.
9 ¶ The a writing of Hezekiah king
of Judah, when he had been sick,
and was recovered of his sickness:
10 I said in the cutting off of my
days, I shall go to the gates of the
grave: I am deprived of the residue
of my years.
11 I said, I shall not see the Lord,

living: I shall behold man no more
with the inhabitants of the world.

and make me to live.
17 Behold, a for peace I had great
bitterness: but thou hast in love to
my soul b delivered it from the pit of
corruption: for thou hast cast all
my sins behind thy back.
18 For the grave cannot praise
thee, death can not celebrate thee:

Lord.

nothing in his house, nor in all his
dominion, that Hezekiah shewed
them not.
3 ¶ Then came Isaiah the prophet
unto king Hezekiah, and said unto
him, What said these men? and
from whence came they unto thee?
And Hezekiah said, They are come
from a far country unto me, even
from Babylon.
4 Then said he, What have they
seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
answered, All that is in mine house
have they seen: there is nothing
among my treasures that I have not
shewed them.
5 Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah,
a 
Hear the word of the Lord of hosts:
6 Behold, the days come, that
all that is in thine house, and that
which thy fathers have laid up in
store until this day, shall be carried

saith the Lord.
7 And of thy a sons that shall issue
from thee, which thou shalt beget,
shall they take away; and they shall
be eunuchs in the palace of the king
of Babylon.
8 Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah,
Good is the word of the Lord which
thou hast spoken. He said moreover,
For there shall be peace and truth
in my days.

9 Thou whom I have taken from
the ends of the earth, and called
thee from the chief men thereof,
and said unto thee, Thou art my

not cast thee away.
10 ¶ a Fear thou not; for I am with
thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy
God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I
will help thee; yea, I will uphold
thee with the right hand of my
righteousness.
11 Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed
and confounded: they shall be as
nothing; and they that strive with
thee shall a perish.
12 Thou shalt seek them, and
shalt not find them, even them that
contended with thee: they that war
against thee shall be as nothing, and
as a thing of nought.
13 For I the Lord thy God will
hold thy right hand, saying unto
thee, Fear not; I will help thee.
14 Fear not, thou a worm Jacob, and
ye men of Israel; I will help thee,

teeth: thou shalt thresh the a mountains, and beat them small, and shalt
make the hills as chaff.
16 Thou shalt a fan them, and the
wind shall carry them away, and the
whirlwind shall scatter them: and
thou shalt rejoice in the Lord, and

from Babylon—Come unto Jehovah
(Christ) and be saved—To Him every
knee will bow and every tongue will
take an oath.
Thus saith the Lord to his a anointed,
to b Cyrus, whose right hand I have
c 
holden, to d subdue nations before
him; and I will loose the loins of
kings, to open before him the e two
leaved gates; and the gates shall
not be shut;
2 I will go before thee, and make
the a crooked places straight: I will
b 
break in pieces the gates of brass,
and cut in sunder the bars of iron:

3 And I will give thee the a treasures of darkness, and hidden riches
of secret places, that thou mayest
know that I, the Lord, which call
thee by thy b name, am the c God of
Israel.
4 For Jacob my a servant’s sake,
and Israel mine b elect, I have even
c 
called thee by thy name: I have
surnamed thee, though thou hast
not known me.
5 ¶ a I am the Lord, and there is
none else, there is no God beside
me: I girded thee, though thou hast
not known me:
6 That they may know from the
a 
rising of the sun, and from the
west, that there is none beside me. I
am the Lord, and there is none else.
7 I form the a light, and create
darkness: I make peace, and create
b 
evil: I the Lord do all these things.
8 Drop down, ye heavens, from
above, and let the skies pour down
a 
righteousness: let the earth open,
and let b them bring forth c salvation,
and let righteousness spring up together; I the Lord have created it.
9 Woe unto him that a striveth with
his b Maker! Let the potsherd strive
with the potsherds of the earth.
Shall the c clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy
work, He hath no hands?
10 Woe unto him that saith unto
his father, What begettest thou?
or to a the woman, What hast thou

14 Thus saith the Lord, The labour of a Egypt, and merchandise of
Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of
stature, shall come over unto thee,
and they shall be thine: they shall
come b after thee; in chains they shall
come over, and they shall fall down
unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, saying, Surely God
is in thee; and there is c none else,
there is no God.
15 Verily thou art a God that a hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the

16 They shall be ashamed, and

shall go to confusion together that
are makers of a idols.

Isaiah 45:18–46:8

18 For thus saith the Lord that
created the heavens; God himself
that formed the earth and made it;
he hath established it, he created
it not in vain, he formed it to be
b 
inhabited: I am the Lord; and there
is none else.
19 I have not spoken in a secret, in
a dark place of the earth: I said not
unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me
in vain: I the Lord speak b righteousness, I declare things that are c right.
20 ¶ Assemble yourselves and
come; draw near together, ye that
are a escaped of the b nations: they
have no c knowledge that set up the
wood of their graven image, and
d 
pray unto a god that cannot save.
21 Tell ye, and bring them near;
yea, let them take counsel together:
who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from
that time? have not I the Lord?
and there is no God else beside me;
a a just God and a b Saviour; there is
none beside me.
22 a Look unto me, and be ye b saved,
all the ends of the earth: for I am
God, and there is none else.
23 I have sworn by myself, the
word is gone out of my mouth in
righteousness, and shall not return,
That unto me every a knee shall bow,
every tongue shall b swear.
24 Surely, shall one say, in the Lord
have I righteousness and a strength:
even to him shall men come; and all
that are incensed against him shall
be ashamed.
25 In the Lord shall all the seed of
Israel be a justified, and shall glory.

their idols were upon the beasts, and

heavy loaden; they are a b burden to

2 a They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the
burden, but themselves are gone
into captivity.
3 ¶ Hearken unto me, O house of
Jacob, and all the a remnant of the
house of Israel, which are borne by
me from the belly, which are carried
from the womb:
4 And even to your a old age I am he;
and even to b hoar hairs will I carry
you: I have made, and I will bear;
even I will c carry, and will d deliver
you.
5 ¶ To whom will ye a liken me,
and make me equal, and compare
me, that we may be like?
6 They lavish gold out of the bag,
and weigh silver in the balance, and
hire a goldsmith; and he maketh
it a god: they fall down, yea, they
a 
worship.
7 They a bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in
his place, and he standeth; from his

shall b cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.

12 Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of

Listen, O isles, unto me; and b hearken, ye people, from far; The Lord
hath c called me from the womb;
from the bowels of my mother hath
he made mention of my name.
2 And he hath made my mouth
like a sharp a sword; in the shadow
of his hand hath he hid me, and
made me a polished shaft; in his
quiver hath he hid me;
3 And said unto me, Thou art my
a 
servant, O Israel, in whom I will
be b glorified.
4 Then I said, I have laboured in
vain, I have spent my strength for
nought, and in vain: yet surely my
judgment is with the Lord, and my
work with my God.
5 ¶ And now, saith the Lord that
a 
formed me from the womb to be
his servant, to bring Jacob again to
him, Though Israel be not gathered,
yet shall I be glorious in the eyes
of the Lord, and my God shall be
my strength.
6 And he said, It is a light thing
that thou shouldest be my servant
to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and
to restore the preserved of Israel: I
will also give thee for a a light to the
b 
Gentiles, that thou mayest be my

7 Thus saith the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One,
to him whom man despiseth, to him
whom the nation abhorreth, to a
servant of rulers, Kings shall see
and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the Lord that is
faithful, and the Holy One of Israel,
and he shall choose thee.
8 Thus saith the Lord, In an acceptable a time have I heard thee, and
in a day of salvation have I helped
thee: and I will preserve thee, and
give thee for a b covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause
to c inherit the desolate heritages;
9 That thou mayest say to the a prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in
darkness, Shew yourselves. They
shall feed in the ways, and their
pastures shall be in all high places.
10 They shall not hunger nor
a 
thirst; neither shall the heat nor

12 I, even I, am he that comforteth
you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be a afraid of a man that shall
die, and of the son of man which
shall be made as grass;
13 And a forgettest the Lord thy
maker, that hath stretched forth the
heavens, and laid the foundations
of the b earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the
fury of the oppressor, as if he were
ready to destroy ? and where is the
fury of the oppressor?
14 The captive exile hasteneth
that he may be loosed, and that he
should not die in the a pit, nor that
his bread should fail.
15 But I am the Lord thy God,
that divided the a sea, whose waves
roared: The Lord of hosts is his
name.
16 And I have put my a words in
thy mouth, and I have covered thee
in the shadow of mine hand, that
I may plant the heavens, and lay
the foundations of the earth, and
say unto Zion, Thou art my people.
17 ¶ Awake, awake, stand up, O
Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the
hand of the Lord the a cup of his
b 
fury; thou hast drunken the dregs
of the c cup of trembling, and wrung
them out.
18 There is none to guide her among
all the sons whom she hath brought
forth; neither is there any that taketh
her by the hand of all the sons that
she hath brought up.
19 These a two things are come unto
thee; who shall be sorry for thee?

4 ¶ Surely he hath a borne our

of thine habitations: spare not,
lengthen thy cords, and strengthen
thy a stakes;
3 For thou shalt break forth on
the right hand and on the left; and
thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles,
and make the desolate cities to be
inhabited.
4 Fear not; for thou shalt not be
ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put
to shame: for thou shalt forget the
a 
shame of thy youth, and shalt not
remember the b reproach of thy widowhood any more.
5 For thy Maker is thine a husband;
the b Lord of hosts is his name; and
thy c Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The d God of the whole earth
shall he be called.
6 For the Lord hath called thee as
a a woman b forsaken and grieved in
spirit, and a c wife of youth, d when
thou wast refused, saith thy God.
7 For a small a moment have I b forsaken thee; but with great mercies
will I c gather thee.
8 In a little a wrath I b hid my c face
from thee for a moment; but with
everlasting d kindness will I have
e 
mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy
Redeemer.
9 For this is as the waters of Noah
unto me: for as I have sworn that
the a waters of Noah should no more
go over the earth; so have I sworn
that I would not be wroth with thee,
nor rebuke thee.
10 For the a mountains shall depart,
and the hills be removed; but my
kindness shall not depart from thee,
neither shall the b covenant of my

that hath mercy on thee.
11 ¶ O thou afflicted, tossed with
tempest, and not comforted, behold,
I will lay thy a stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with
sapphires.
12 And I will make thy windows
of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.
13 And all thy a children shall be
b 
taught of the Lord; and great shall
be the c peace of thy children.
14 In righteousness shalt thou be
established: thou shalt be far from
oppression; for thou shalt not fear:
and from terror; for it shall not
come near thee.
15 Behold, they shall surely gather
together, but not by me: whosoever
shall gather together against thee
shall fall for thy sake.
16 Behold, I have created the smith
that bloweth the coals in the fire,
and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the a waster to destroy.
17 ¶ No a weapon that is formed
against thee shall prosper; and every
b 
tongue that shall rise against thee
in judgment thou shalt condemn.
This is the heritage of the c servants
of the Lord, and their righteousness
is of me, saith the Lord.

without money and without d price.
2 Wherefore do ye a spend money

4 Behold, I have given him for a

5 Behold, thou shalt call a nation
that thou knowest not, and a nations
that knew not thee shall run unto
thee because of the Lord thy God,
and for the Holy One of Israel; for
he hath glorified thee.
6 ¶ a Seek ye the b Lord while he

while he is near:
7 Let the wicked forsake his

The people of Israel are separated from

Behold, the Lord’s a hand is not
shortened, that it cannot save;
neither his ear heavy, that it cannot c hear:
2 But your iniquities have a separated between you and your God,
and your b sins c have hid his face
from you, that he will not d hear.
3 For your hands are defiled with
a 
blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your

Chapter 64
The people of the Lord pray for the Second Coming and for the salvation that
will then be theirs.
Oh that thou wouldest a rend the
heavens, that thou wouldest come
down, that the b mountains might
flow down at thy c presence,
2 As when the melting fire burneth,
the fire causeth the waters to boil,
to make thy name known to thine
adversaries, that the nations may
a 
tremble at thy presence!
3 When thou didst a terrible things
which we looked not for, thou camest down, the b mountains flowed
down at thy presence.
4 For since the beginning of the
world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the
a 
eye seen, O God, beside thee, what
he hath b prepared for him that
waiteth for him.
5 Thou meetest him that rejoiceth
and worketh righteousness, those
that remember thee in thy ways:
behold, thou art wroth; for we have
sinned: in those is continuance, and
we shall be saved.
6 But we are all as an a unclean
thing, and all our righteousnesses
are as b filthy rags; and we all do
fade as a leaf; and our iniquities,
like the wind, have taken us away.
7 And there is none that calleth
upon thy name, that stirreth up
himself to take hold of thee: for
thou hast hid thy a face from us,
and hast consumed us, because of
our iniquities.

father; we are the clay, and thou

6 Behold, it is written before me:
I will not keep silence, but will
a 
recompense, even recompense into
their bosom,
7 Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith
the Lord, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and
a 
blasphemed me upon the hills:
therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.
8 ¶ Thus saith the Lord, As the
a 
new wine is found in the cluster,
and one saith, Destroy it not; for a
blessing is in it: so will I do for my
servants’ sakes, that I may b not destroy them all.
9 And I will bring forth a seed out
of Jacob, and out of a Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine
b 
elect shall c inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.
10 And Sharon shall be a fold of
flocks, and the valley of a Achor a
place for the herds to lie down in,
for my people that have sought me.
11 ¶ But ye are they that forsake
the Lord, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that
a 
troop, and that furnish the drink
offering unto that b number.
12 Therefore will I number you
to the sword, and ye shall all bow
down to the slaughter: because
when I a called, ye did not answer;
when I spake, ye did not hear; but
did evil before mine eyes, and did
choose that wherein I delighted not.
13 Therefore thus saith the Lord
God, Behold, my servants shall eat,
but ye shall be hungry: behold, my
servants shall drink, but ye shall be
thirsty: behold, my servants shall
rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:

ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a a rejoicing, and her people a joy.

and joy in my people: and the voice
of weeping shall be no more heard
in her, nor the voice of crying.

that hath not filled his days: for the

child shall die an hundred years
old; but the sinner being an hundred

plant vineyards, and a eat the fruit
of them.

their abominations.

were in a Anathoth in the land

Judah, unto the end of the eleventh
year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah
king of Judah, unto the a carrying
away of Jerusalem captive in the
fifth month.
4 Then the word of the Lord came
unto me, saying,
5 Before I a formed thee in the belly
I b knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I c sanctified thee, and I d ordained thee a
prophet unto the e nations.
6 Then said I, Ah, Lord God! behold, I cannot a speak: for I am a

child.

Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt
go to all that I shall a send thee, and

of the house of Israel:
5 ¶ Thus saith the Lord, What
iniquity have your fathers found
in me, that they are gone far from
me, and have walked after vanity,
and are become vain?
6 Neither said they, Where is the
Lord that brought us up out of the
land of Egypt, that a led us through
the wilderness, through a land of
deserts and of pits, through a land of
drought, and of the shadow of death,
through a land that no man passed
through, and where no man dwelt?
7 And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof
and the goodness thereof; but when
ye entered, ye a defiled my b land,
and made mine heritage an abomi­
nation.
8 The priests said not, Where is
the Lord? and they that handle the
law knew me not: the a pastors also
transgressed against me, and the
b 
prophets prophesied by Baal, and
walked after things that do not profit.
9 ¶ Wherefore I will yet plead with
you, saith the Lord, and with your
children’s children will I plead.
10 For pass a over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar,
and consider diligently, and see if
there be such a thing.
11 Hath a nation changed their
a 
gods, which are yet no gods? but
my people have changed their glory
for that which doth not profit.
12 Be astonished, O ye heavens, at
this, and be horribly afraid, be ye
very desolate, saith the Lord.
13 For my people have committed
two a evils; they have forsaken me
the fountain of b living waters, and
hewed them out cisterns, broken
cisterns, that can hold no water.

thou saidst, I will not transgress;

Israel and Judah defiled and polluted
the land through wickedness—In the
last days, the Lord will gather the people of Israel, one from a city and two
from a family, and bring them to Zion.
They say, If a man a put away his
wife, and she go from him, and become another man’s, shall he return
unto her again? shall not that land
be greatly b polluted? but thou hast
played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith
the Lord.

5 Will he reserve his a anger for

Behold, thou hast spoken and done
evil things as thou couldest.
6 ¶ The Lord said also unto me
in the days of Josiah the king, Hast
thou seen that which backsliding
Israel hath done? she is gone up
upon every high mountain and
under every green tree, and there
hath played the harlot.
7 And I said after she had done all
these things, Turn thou unto me. But
she returned not. And her treacherous a sister Judah saw it.
8 And I saw, when for all the causes
whereby backsliding Israel committed a adultery I had put her away,
and given her a bill of b divorce;
yet her treacherous sister Judah
feared not, but went and played
the harlot also.
9 And it came to pass through the
lightness of her whoredom, that
she defiled the land, and a committed adultery with b stones and
with c stocks.
10 And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned
unto me with her whole heart, but

feignedly, saith the Lord.
11 And the Lord said unto me, The
backsliding Israel hath a justified herself more than treacherous Judah.

13 Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed
against the Lord thy God, and hast
scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye
have not a obeyed my voice, saith
the Lord.
14 Turn, O backsliding children,
saith the Lord; for I am a married
unto you: and I will take you one
of a city, and two of a family, and
I will b bring you to c Zion:
15 And I will give you a pastors according to mine heart, which shall
feed you with b knowledge and understanding.
16 And it shall come to pass, when
ye be multiplied and increased in
the land, in those days, saith the
Lord, they shall say no more, The
a 
ark of the covenant of the Lord:
neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither
shall they visit it; neither shall that
be done any more.
17 At that time they shall call a Jerusalem the throne of the Lord; and
all the b nations shall be c gathered
unto it, to the name of the Lord, to
Jerusalem: neither shall they walk
any more after the d imagination of
their evil heart.
18 In those days the a house of Judah shall walk with the house of
Israel, and they shall come together
out of the b land of the c north to the
land that I have given for an inheri­
tance unto your fathers.
19 But I said, How shall I put thee
among the children, and give thee
a pleasant land, a goodly heritage
of the hosts of nations? and I said,
Thou shalt call me, My father; and

21 A voice was heard upon the high
places, weeping and supplications
of the children of Israel: for they
have perverted their way, and they
have forgotten the Lord their God.
22 Return, ye backsliding children,
and I will a heal your backslidings.
Behold, we come unto thee; for thou
art the Lord our God.
23 Truly in vain is salvation hoped
for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains: truly in the
Lord our God is the salvation of
Israel.
24 For shame hath devoured the
labour of our fathers from our youth;
their flocks and their herds, their
sons and their daughters.
25 We lie down in our a shame, and

Israel and Judah are called to repentance—Jeremiah laments for the miseries of Judah.

shall bless themselves in him, and
in him shall they glory.

that none can quench it, because of
the evil of your doings.

26 I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful
place was a wilderness, and all the
cities thereof were broken down at
the presence of the Lord, and by
his fierce anger.
27 For thus hath the Lord said,
The whole land shall be desolate;
yet will I not make a full a end.
28 For this shall the earth mourn,
and the heavens above be black:
because I have spoken it, I have
purposed it, and will not a repent,

29 The whole city shall flee for

10 ¶ Go ye up upon her walls, and

11 For the house of Israel and the
house of Judah have dealt very

said, It is not he; neither shall evil
come upon us; neither shall we see

13 And the prophets shall become

thus shall it be done unto them.

15 Lo, I will bring a nation upon
you from far, O house of Israel, saith
the Lord: it is a mighty nation, it is

16 Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men.
17 And they shall a eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy sons

saying,
21 Hear now this, O a foolish people,
and without understanding; which
have eyes, and b see not; which have
ears, and c hear not:
22 Fear ye not me? saith the Lord:
will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand
for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass
it: and though the waves thereof
toss themselves, yet can they not
prevail; though they roar, yet can
they not pass over it?
23 But this people hath a revolting and a a rebellious heart; they
are revolted and gone.
24 Neither say they in their heart,
Let us now fear the Lord our God,
that giveth rain, both a the former
and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks
of the harvest.
25 ¶ Your iniquities have turned
away these things, and your sins have
withholden good things from you.
26 For among my people are found
a 
wicked men: they lay wait, as he
that setteth snares; they set a trap,
they b catch men.
27 As a cage is full of birds, so are
their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become a great, and

yea, they overpass the deeds of the
wicked: they a judge not the cause,
the cause of the fatherless, yet they
prosper; and the right of the needy
do they not judge.
29 Shall I not visit for these things?
saith the Lord: shall not my soul be
avenged on such a nation as this?

means; and my people d love to have
it so: and what will ye do in the
end thereof?
Chapter 6
Jerusalem will be destroyed because of
her iniquity—She will be overrun by a
great and cruel nation.
O ye children of Benjamin, gather
yourselves to flee out of the midst
of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of
fire in Beth-haccerem: for evil appeareth out of the a north, and great
destruction.
2 I have likened the daughter of
Zion to a comely and delicate woman.
3 The shepherds with their flocks
shall come unto her; they shall
pitch their tents against her round
about; they shall feed every one in
his place.
4 Prepare ye war against her;
arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe
unto us! for the day goeth away,
for the shadows of the evening are
stretched out.
5 Arise, and let us go by night, and
let us destroy her palaces.
6 ¶ For thus hath the Lord of hosts
said, Hew ye down trees, and cast
a a mount against Jerusalem: this is
the city to be b visited; she is wholly
oppression in the midst of her.
7 As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her a wickedness: b violence and spoil is heard in
her; before me continually is grief
and wounds.
8 Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem,
lest my soul depart from thee; lest
I make thee desolate, a land not
inhabited.

They shall a throughly glean the
remnant of Israel as a vine: turn
back thine hand as a grapegatherer

11 Therefore I am full of the fury
of the Lord; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the
children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for
even the husband with the wife
shall be taken, the aged with him
that is full of days.
12 And their houses shall be turned
unto others, with their fields and
wives together: for I will stretch
out my hand upon the inhabitants
of the land, saith the Lord.

20 To what purpose cometh there
to me incense from Sheba, and the

your burnt offerings are not a acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet

21 Therefore thus saith the Lord,
Behold, I will lay a stumblingblocks

shall perish.
22 Thus saith the Lord, Behold,
a people cometh from the a north

raised from the sides of the earth.
23 They shall lay hold on bow and

in array as men for war against

24 We have heard the fame thereof:

from the Lord, saying,
2 Stand in the gate of the Lord’s

gates to worship the Lord.
3 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the

you to dwell in this place.
4 Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord, The

10 And come and a stand before me
in this house, which is called by my
name, and say, We are delivered to
do all these abominations?
11 Is this a house, which is called
by my name, become a b den of c robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I
have seen it, saith the Lord.
12 But go ye now unto my place
which was in a Shiloh, where I set
my name at the first, and see what
I did to it for the wickedness of my
people Israel.
13 And now, because ye have done
all these works, saith the Lord, and
I spake unto you, rising up early and
speaking, but ye heard not; and I
called you, but ye a answered not;
14 Therefore will I do unto this
a 
house, which is called by my name,
wherein ye trust, and unto the place
which I gave to you and to your
fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.
15 And I will cast you out of my
sight, as I have cast out all your
brethren, even the whole seed of
Ephraim.
16 Therefore pray not thou for this
people, neither lift up cry nor prayer
for them, neither make intercession
to me: for I will not a hear thee.
17 ¶ Seest thou not what they do
in the cities of Judah and in the

and upon the fruit of the ground;
and it shall burn, and shall not be
quenched.
21 ¶ Thus saith the Lord of hosts,
the God of Israel; Put your burnt
offerings unto your sacrifices, and
eat flesh.
22 For I spake not unto your
fathers, nor commanded them in
the day that I brought them out of
the land of Egypt, concerning burnt
offerings or sacrifices:
23 But this thing commanded I
them, saying, a Obey my b voice, and
I will be your God, and ye shall be
my people: and walk ye in all the
ways that I have commanded you,
that it may be well unto you.
24 But they hearkened not, nor

29 ¶ Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up

the Lord hath rejected and forsaken
the generation of his wrath.
30 For the children of Judah have
done evil in my sight, saith the Lord:

in the house which is called by my
name, to b pollute it.
31 And they have built the high
places of a Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of b Hinnom, to c burn

not, neither came it into my heart.
32 ¶ Therefore, behold, the days
come, saith the Lord, that it shall
no more be called Tophet, nor the
valley of the son of Hinnom, but
the valley of slaughter: for they
shall bury in Tophet, till there be
no place.
33 And the a carcases of this people

17 ¶ Thus saith the Lord of hosts,
Consider ye, and call for the mourning a women, that they may come;
and send for cunning women, that
they may come:
18 And let them make haste, and
take up a wailing for us, that our
eyes may run down with tears, and
our eyelids gush out with waters.
19 For a voice of wailing is heard
out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we
are greatly confounded, because we
have forsaken the land, because our
dwellings have cast us out.
20 Yet hear the word of the Lord, O
ye women, and let your ear receive
the word of his mouth, and teach
your daughters wailing, and every
one her neighbour lamentation.
21 For death is come up into our
windows, and is entered into our
palaces, to cut off the children from
without, and the young men from
the streets.
22 Speak, Thus saith the Lord,
Even the a carcases of men shall fall
as dung upon the open field, and as
the handful after the harvestman,
and none shall gather them.
23 ¶ Thus saith the Lord, Let not
the wise man glory in his wisdom,
neither let the mighty man glory
in his might, let not the rich man
glory in his a riches:
24 But let him that glorieth a glory
in this, that he understandeth and
knoweth me, that I am the Lord

Chapter 10
Learn not the way of other nations—
Their gods are idols and molten images—
The Lord is the true and living God.
Hear ye the word which the Lord
speaketh unto you, O house of
Israel:
2 Thus saith the Lord, Learn not
the way of the a heathen, and be not
dismayed at the signs of heaven; for
the heathen are dismayed at them.
3 For the a customs of the people
are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of
the forest, the work of the hands
of the workman, with the axe.
4 They deck it with silver and with
gold; they fasten it with nails and
with hammers, that it move not.
5 They are upright as the palm tree,
but speak not: they must needs be
a 
borne, because they cannot go. Be
not afraid of them; for they cannot
do evil, neither also is it in them to
do good.
6 Forasmuch as there is none a like
unto thee, O Lord; thou art great,
and thy name is great in might.

King of nations? for to thee doth it

8 But they are altogether brutish

of vanities.
9 Silver spread into plates is
brought from Tarshish, and gold

founder: blue and purple is their
clothing: they are all the a work of
b 
cunning men.
10 But the Lord is the true a God,
he is the b living God, and an everlasting c king: at his wrath the earth
shall tremble, and the nations shall
not be able to abide his d indignation.
11 Thus shall ye say unto them,
The a gods that have not made the
heavens and the earth, even they
shall perish from the earth, and
from under these heavens.
12 He hath made the earth by his
power, he hath established the world
by his wisdom, and hath stretched
out the heavens by his discretion.
13 When he uttereth his voice,
there is a multitude of waters in
the heavens, and he causeth the
vapours to ascend from the ends
of the earth; he maketh lightnings
with rain, and bringeth forth the
wind out of his a treasures.
14 Every man is brutish in his
knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven a image: for
his molten image is falsehood, and
there is no breath in them.
15 They are vanity, and the work
of a errors: in the time of their b visitation they shall perish.

them: for he is the former of all
things; and Israel is the rod of his

land, O inhabitant of the fortress.
18 For thus saith the Lord, Behold,
I will sling out the inhabitants of
the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so.
19 ¶ Woe is me for my hurt! my
wound is grievous: but I said, Truly
this is a grief, and I must bear it.
20 My a tabernacle is spoiled, and
all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they
are not: there is none to stretch forth
my tent any more, and to set up

21 For the a pastors are become
brutish, and have not sought the
Lord: therefore they shall not
prosper, and all their flocks shall
be scattered.
22 Behold, the noise of the bruit
is come, and a great commotion out
of the a north country, to make the
cities of Judah desolate, and a den
of b dragons.
23 ¶ O Lord, I know that the a way
of man is not in himself: it is not in
man that walketh to direct his steps.
24 O Lord, a correct me, but with
b 
judgment; not in thine anger, lest
thou bring me to nothing.
25 Pour out thy fury upon the

upon the a families that call not
on thy name: for they have eaten
up Jacob, and devoured him, and
consumed him, and have made his

saith the Lord God of Israel; a Cursed
be the man that b obeyeth not the
words of this c covenant,
4 Which I commanded your fa­
thers in the day that I brought them
forth out of the land of Egypt, from
the iron furnace, saying, a Obey
my voice, and do them, according
to all which b I command you: so
shall ye be my people, and I will
be your God:
5 That I may perform the a oath
which I have sworn unto your
fathers, to give them a b land c flowing with milk and honey, as it is this
day. Then answered I, and said, So
be it, O Lord.
6 Then the Lord said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities
of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of
this covenant, and do them.
7 For I earnestly a protested unto
your fathers in the day that I brought
them up out of the land of Egypt,
even unto this day, rising early and
protesting, saying, Obey my voice.

their ear, but walked every one in

therefore I a will bring upon them all
the words of this covenant, which
I commanded them to do; but they
did them not.
9 And the Lord said unto me, A

men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
10 They are a turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which
refused to hear my words; and they
went after other gods to b serve

covenant which I made with their
fathers.
11 ¶ Therefore thus saith the
Lord, Behold, I will bring a evil
upon them, which they shall not
be able to escape; and though they
shall b cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.
12 Then shall the cities of Judah
and inhabitants of Jerusalem go,
and cry unto the gods unto whom
they offer incense: but they shall
not save them at all in the time of
their trouble.
13 For according to the number of
thy cities were thy a gods, O Judah;
and according to the number of the
streets of Jerusalem have ye set up
altars to that shameful thing, even
b 
altars to burn incense unto Baal.
14 Therefore a pray not thou for
this people, neither lift up a cry or
prayer for them: for I will not hear
them in the time that they cry unto
me for their trouble.
15 What hath my beloved to do in
mine house, seeing she hath wrought
lewdness with many, and a the holy
flesh is passed from thee? when
thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.
16 The Lord called thy name, A
a 
green b olive tree, fair, and of goodly
fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it,
and the branches of it are broken.
17 For the Lord of hosts, that
planted thee, hath pronounced
evil against thee, for the evil of the
house of Israel and of the house of
Judah, which they have done against
themselves to provoke me to anger
in offering incense unto Baal.

thou hast seen me, and tried mine
heart toward thee: pull them out
like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
4 How long shall the land mourn,
and the herbs of every field wither,
for the wickedness of them that
dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they
said, He shall not see our last end.
5 ¶ If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee,
then how canst thou contend with
horses? and if in the land of peace,
wherein thou trustedst, they wearied
thee, then how wilt thou do in the
swelling of Jordan?
6 For even thy a brethren, and the
house of thy father, even they have
dealt treacherously with thee; yea,
they have called a multitude after
thee: believe them not, though they
speak fair words unto thee.
7 ¶ I have a forsaken mine house, I
have left mine heritage; I have given
the dearly beloved of my soul into
the hand of her enemies.
8 Mine heritage is unto me as a lion
in the forest; it crieth out against
me: therefore have I hated it.
9 Mine heritage is unto me as
a speckled bird, the birds round
about are against her; come ye, assemble all the a beasts of the field,
come to devour.
10 Many a pastors have destroyed
my b vineyard, they have trodden
my portion under foot, they have
made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
11 They have made it desolate, and
being desolate it mourneth unto me;
the whole land is made desolate,
because no man a layeth it to heart.

all mine evil neighbours, that touch
the inheritance which I have caused
my people Israel to inherit; Behold,
I will pluck them out of their land,
and pluck out the house of Judah
from among them.
15 And it shall come to pass, after
that I have plucked them out I will
return, and have a compassion on
them, and will b bring them again,
every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.
16 And it shall come to pass, if they
will diligently learn the ways of my
people, to swear by my name, The
Lord liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they

2 So I got a girdle according to
the word of the Lord, and put it
on my loins.
3 And the word of the Lord came
unto me the second time, saying,
4 Take the girdle that thou hast
got, which is upon thy loins, and
arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it
there in a hole of the rock.

6 And it came to pass after many
days, that the Lord said unto me,
Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the
girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.
7 Then I went to Euphrates, and
digged, and took the girdle from
the place where I had hid it: and,
behold, the girdle was marred, it
was profitable for nothing.
8 Then the word of the Lord came
unto me, saying,
9 Thus saith the Lord, After this
manner will I mar the a pride of
Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.
10 This evil people, which refuse
to hear my words, which walk in
the a imagination of their heart,
and b walk after other gods, to serve
them, and to worship them, shall
even be as this girdle, which is good
for nothing.
11 For as the girdle cleaveth to the
loins of a man, so have I caused to
cleave unto me the whole house of
Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the Lord; that they might
be unto me for a people, and for
a name, and for a praise, and for a
glory: but they would not a hear.
12 ¶ Therefore thou shalt speak
unto them this word; Thus saith
the Lord God of Israel, Every bottle
shall be filled with wine: and they
shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall
be filled with wine?
13 Then shalt thou say unto them,
Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will
fill all the inhabitants of this land,
even the kings that sit upon David’s
throne, and the priests, and the
prophets, and all the inhabitants
of Jerusalem, with a drunkenness.

before your feet stumble upon the

17 But if ye will not hear it, my
soul shall weep in secret places for

Jeremiah prays because of dearth and

Jeremiah concerning the a dearth.
2 Judah mourneth, and the gates
thereof languish; they are a black
unto the ground; and the cry of
Jerusalem is gone up.
3 And their nobles have sent their
little ones to the waters: they came
to the pits, and found no water; they
returned with their vessels empty;
they were ashamed and confounded,
and covered their heads.
4 Because the ground is chapt, for
there was no a rain in the earth, the
plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.
5 Yea, the hind also calved in the
field, and forsook it, because there
was no grass.
6 And the wild asses did stand in
the high places, they snuffed up
the wind like a dragons; their eyes
did fail, because there was no grass.
7 ¶ O Lord, though our iniquities
testify against us, do thou it for thy
name’s sake: for our backslidings are
many; we have sinned against thee.

9 Why shouldest thou be as a man

10 ¶ Thus saith the Lord unto
this people, Thus have they loved
to wander, they have not a refrained
their feet, therefore the Lord doth
not accept them; he will now remember their b iniquity, and visit
their sins.
11 Then said the Lord unto me,
a 
Pray not for this people for their
good.
12 When they fast, I will not a hear
their cry; and when they offer burnt
offering and an oblation, I will not
accept them: but I will b consume
them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.
13 ¶ Then said I, Ah, Lord God!
behold, the prophets say unto them,
Ye shall not see the a sword, neither
shall ye have famine; but I will give
you assured peace in this place.
14 Then the Lord said unto me,
The a prophets prophesy b lies in my
name: I sent them not, neither have
I commanded them, neither spake
unto them: they prophesy unto you

them, their wives, nor their sons,
nor their daughters: for I will pour
their wickedness upon them.
17 ¶ Therefore thou shalt say this
word unto them; Let mine eyes run
down with tears night and day, and
let them not cease: for the virgin
daughter of my people is broken
with a great breach, with a very
grievous blow.
18 If I go forth into the field, then

trouble!
20 We a acknowledge, O Lord, our
wickedness, and the iniquity of

against thee.

death, to death; and such as are
for the sword, to the sword; and such
as are for the famine, to the famine;
and such as are for the captivity, to
the captivity.

thou hast borne me a man of b strife
and a man of contention to the whole

nor men have lent to me on c usury;

Jeremiah 17:1–18
Chapter 17

The captivity of Judah comes because
of sin and forsaking the Lord—Hallow the Sabbath day; doing so will
save the people; otherwise they will be
destroyed.
The sin of Judah is written with a
pen of iron, and with the point of
a diamond: it is a graven upon the
table of their heart, and upon the
b 
horns of your altars;
2 Whilst their children remember
their a altars and their b groves by
the green trees upon the high hills.
3 O my a mountain in the field, I
will give thy substance and all thy
treasures to the spoil, and thy high
places for sin, throughout all thy
borders.
4 And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I
gave thee; and I will cause thee to
a 
serve thine enemies in the b land
which thou knowest not: for ye have
kindled a fire in mine anger, which
shall burn for ever.
5 ¶ Thus saith the Lord; a Cursed be
the man that b trusteth in man, and
maketh c flesh his arm, and whose
heart d departeth from the Lord.
6 For he shall be like the a heath in
the desert, and shall not see when
good cometh; but shall inhabit the
parched places in the wilderness,
in a b salt land and not inhabited.
7 Blessed is the man that a trusteth in the Lord, and whose b hope

19 ¶ Thus said the Lord unto me;
Go and stand in the gate of the
children of the people, whereby
the kings of Judah come in, and
by the which they go out, and in
all the gates of Jerusalem;
20 And say unto them, Hear ye
the word of the Lord, ye kings of
Judah, and all Judah, and all the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:
21 Thus saith the Lord; Take heed
to yourselves, and bear no burden
on the a sabbath day, nor bring it in
by the gates of Jerusalem;
22 Neither carry forth a burden out
of your houses on the sabbath day,
neither do ye any work, but hallow
ye the sabbath day, as I commanded

23 But they obeyed not, neither
inclined their ear, but made their
neck a stiff, that they might not hear,
nor receive instruction.

Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain

Chapter 18
Israel is as potter’s clay in the hands
of the Lord—If nations repent, the
Lord withholds the evil decreed against
them—The people of Judah will be
scattered.
The word which came to Jeremiah
from the Lord, saying,
2 Arise, and go down to the a potter’s house, and there I will cause

3 Then I went down to the potter’s
house, and, behold, he wrought a
work on the wheels.
4 And the vessel that he made of
clay was marred in the hand of the
potter: so he made it again another
vessel, as seemed good to the potter
to make it.
5 Then the word of the Lord came

Lord. Behold, as the clay is in the
potter’s hand, so are ye in mine

I would benefit them.
11 ¶ Now therefore go to, speak
to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus
saith the Lord; Behold, I frame evil
against you, and devise a device
against you: return ye now every
one from his evil way, and make
your ways and your doings good.
12 And they said, There is no
a 
hope: but we will b walk after our
own devices, and we will every one
do the imagination of his evil heart.
13 Therefore thus saith the Lord;
Ask ye now among the heathen,
who hath heard such things: the
virgin of Israel hath done a very
horrible thing.
14 Will a man leave the snow of
Lebanon which cometh from the rock
of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another
place be forsaken?
15 Because my people hath a forgotten me, they have burned incense to
b 
vanity, and they have caused them
to stumble in their ways from the
ancient paths, to walk in c paths, in
a way not cast up;
16 To make their land a desolate,
and a perpetual hissing; every one
that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and b wag his head.
17 I will scatter them as with an
a 
east wind before the enemy; I will
shew them the b back, and not c the
face, in the day of their calamity.
18 ¶ Then said they, Come, and
let us a devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish
from the priest, nor counsel from
the wise, nor the word from the
prophet. Come, and let us smite
him with the tongue, and let us

20 Shall evil be recompensed for
good? for they have digged a pit
for my soul. Remember that I stood
before thee to speak good for them,
and to turn away thy wrath from
them.
21 Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out
their blood by the force of the sword;
and let their wives be bereaved
of their children, and be widows;
and let their men be put to death;
let their young men be slain by the
sword in battle.
22 Let a cry be heard from their
houses, when thou shalt bring a
troop suddenly upon them: for they
have digged a pit to take me, and
hid snares for my feet.
23 Yet, Lord, thou knowest all their
counsel against me to slay me: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot
out their sin from thy sight, but let
them be overthrown before thee;
deal thus with them in the time of

place, the which whosoever heareth,
his ears shall a tingle.
4 Because they have a forsaken me,
and have b estranged this place, and
have burned incense in it unto other
c 
gods, whom neither they nor their
fathers have known, nor the kings
of Judah, and have filled this place
with the d blood of innocents;
5 They have built also the high
places of Baal, to burn their sons
with a fire for burnt offerings unto
Baal, which I commanded not, nor
spake it, neither came it into my
mind:
6 Therefore, behold, the days come,
saith the Lord, that this place shall
no more be called a Tophet, nor The
valley of the son of Hinnom, but
The valley of slaughter.
7 And I will make void the counsel
of Judah and Jerusalem in this place;
and I will cause them to fall by the
sword before their enemies, and by
the hands of them that seek their
lives: and their a carcases will I give
to be meat for the fowls of the heaven,
and for the beasts of the earth.
8 And I will make this city a desolate, and an hissing; every one that
passeth thereby shall be astonished
and hiss because of all the b plagues
thereof.
9 And I will cause them to a eat the
flesh of their sons and the b flesh of
their daughters, and they shall eat
every one the flesh of his friend in
the siege and straitness, wherewith
their enemies, and they that seek
their lives, shall c straiten them.
10 Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go
with thee,
11 And shalt say unto them, Thus
saith the Lord of hosts; Even so will
I break this people and this city, as

one breaketh a potter’s vessel, that
cannot be made whole again: and
they shall bury them in Tophet, till
there be no place to bury.
12 Thus will I do unto this place,
saith the Lord, and to the inhabi­
tants thereof, and even make this
city as Tophet:
13 And the houses of Jerusalem,
and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of
Tophet, because of all the houses
upon whose a roofs they have burned
incense unto all the host of heaven,
and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods.
14 Then came Jeremiah from
Tophet, whither the Lord had sent
him to prophesy; and he stood in
the court of the Lord’s house; and
said to all the people,
15 Thus saith the Lord of hosts,
the God of Israel; Behold, I will
bring upon this city and upon all
her towns all the evil that I have
pronounced against it, because they
have hardened their necks, that they
might not hear my words.

Jeremiah prophesied these things.
2 Then Pashur a smote Jeremiah

stocks that were in the high gate of
Benjamin, which was by the house
of the Lord.

said Jeremiah unto him, The Lord
hath not called thy name Pashur,
but a Magor-missabib.
4 For thus saith the Lord, Behold,
I will make thee a terror to thyself,
and to all thy friends: and they shall
fall by the sword of their enemies,
and thine eyes shall behold it: and
I will give all Judah into the hand
of the king of Babylon, and he shall
carry them a captive into Babylon,
and shall slay them with the sword.
5 Moreover I will deliver all the
a 
strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the b precious
things thereof, and all the treasures
of the kings of Judah will I give into
the hand of their enemies, which
shall spoil them, and take them,
and carry them to c Babylon.
6 And thou, Pashur, and all that
dwell in thine house shall go into
captivity: and thou shalt come to
Babylon, and there thou shalt die,
and shalt be buried there, thou, and
all thy friends, to whom thou hast
prophesied a lies.
7 ¶ O Lord, thou hast a deceived
me, and I was deceived: thou art
stronger than I, and hast prevailed:
I am in b derision daily, every one
mocketh me.
8 For since I spake, I cried out, I
cried a violence and spoil; because
the word of the Lord was made a
reproach unto me, and a derision,
daily.
9 Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in
his name. But his word was in mine
heart as a a burning fire shut up in
my bones, and I was weary with
forbearing, and I could not b stay.

11 But the Lord is with me as a

the Lord: for he hath delivered the

him very glad.
16 And let that man be as the cities which the Lord a overthrew, and
repented not: and let him hear the
cry in the morning, and the shouting at noontide;
17 Because he slew me not from
the womb; or that my mother might
have been my grave, and her womb
to be always great with me.
18 Wherefore came I forth out of
the womb to see labour and a sorrow,
that my days should be consumed
with shame?

970

Zedekiah sent unto him b Pashur the
son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the
son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,
2 Inquire, I pray thee, of the Lord
for us; for a Nebuchadrezzar king of
Babylon maketh war against us; if
so be that the Lord will deal with
us according to all his wondrous
works, that he may go up from us.
3 ¶ Then said Jeremiah unto them,
Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:
4 Thus saith the Lord God of Israel;
Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands,
wherewith ye fight against the king
of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you a without
the walls, and I will assemble them
into the midst of this city.
5 And I myself will fight against
you with an a outstretched hand and
with a strong arm, even in anger,
and in fury, and in great wrath.
6 And I will smite the inhabitants
of this city, both man and beast:
they shall die of a great pestilence.
7 And afterward, saith the Lord,
I will deliver a Zedekiah king of
Judah, and his servants, and the
people, and such as are left in this
city from the pestilence, from the
sword, and from the famine, into
the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king
of b Babylon, and into the hand of
their enemies, and into the hand
of those that seek their life: and he
shall smite them with the edge of
the sword; he shall not c spare them,
neither have pity, nor have mercy.
8 ¶ And unto this people thou shalt
say, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I
set before you the way of a life, and
the way of death.
9 He that abideth in this city shall
die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he
that goeth out, and a falleth to the

the hand of the king of c Babylon,
and he shall burn it with fire.
11 ¶ And touching the house of
the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the
word of the Lord;
12 O house of David, thus saith
the Lord; Execute judgment in the
morning, and deliver him that is
spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire,
and burn that none can quench it,
because of the evil of your doings.
13 Behold, I am against thee, O

of the plain, saith the Lord; which
say, a Who shall come down against

Lord: and I will kindle a fire in the

2 And say, Hear the word of the
Lord, O king of Judah, that sittest

4 For if ye do this thing indeed,
then shall there enter in by the
gates of this house a kings sitting
upon the throne of David, riding

5 But if ye will not hear these
words, I a swear by myself, saith the
Lord, that this house shall become
a b desolation.
6 For thus saith the Lord unto
the king’s house of Judah; Thou
art Gilead unto me, and the head
of Lebanon: yet surely I will make
thee a wilderness, and cities which
are not inhabited.
7 And I will prepare destroyers
against thee, every one with his
weapons: and they shall cut down
thy choice a cedars, and cast them
into the fire.
8 And many nations shall pass by
this city, and they shall say every
man to his neighbour, Wherefore
hath the Lord a done thus unto this
great city ?
9 Then they shall answer, Because
they have a forsaken the covenant of
the Lord their God, and worshipped
other gods, and served them.
10 ¶ Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore for
him that goeth away: for he shall
return no more, nor see his native
country.
11 For thus saith the Lord touching a Shallum the son of Josiah king
of Judah, which reigned instead of
Josiah his father, which went forth
out of this place; He shall not return thither any more:
12 But he shall die in the place
whither they have led him captive,
and shall see this land no more.

14 That saith, I will build me a

and cutteth him out windows; and
it is ceiled with cedar, and painted
with vermilion.
15 Shalt thou reign, because thou
closest thyself in cedar? did not thy
a 
father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was
well with him?
16 He judged the cause of the
poor and needy; then it was well
with him: was not this to know me?
saith the Lord.
17 But thine eyes and thine heart
are not but for thy covetousness,
and for to shed innocent blood, and
for oppression, and for violence, to
do it.
18 Therefore thus saith the Lord
concerning Jehoiakim the son of
Josiah king of Judah; They shall
not lament for him, saying, Ah my
brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not
lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or,
Ah his glory!
19 He shall be a buried with the
burial of an ass, drawn and cast

from thy youth, that thou a obeyedst

3 And I will a gather the b remnant

Lord, and because of the words of
his holiness.
10 For the land is full of a adulterers; for because of b swearing the
land mourneth; the pleasant places
of the wilderness are dried up, and
their course is evil, and their force
is not right.
11 For both a prophet and b priest
are c profane; yea, in my d house have
I found their wickedness, saith the
Lord.
12 Wherefore their way shall be
unto them as slippery ways in the
darkness: they shall be driven on,
and fall therein: for I will bring evil
upon them, even the year of their
a 
visitation, saith the Lord.
13 And I have seen folly in the
prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people
Israel to err.
14 I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing:
they commit a adultery, and walk in
lies: they strengthen also the hands
of evildoers, that none doth return
from his b wickedness: they are all
of them unto me as Sodom, and the
inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.
15 Therefore thus saith the Lord
of hosts concerning the prophets;
Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the
water of gall: for from the prophets
of Jerusalem is a profaneness gone
forth into all the land.
16 Thus saith the Lord of hosts,
Hearken not unto the words of the
prophets that a prophesy unto you:
they make you vain: they speak a
b 
vision of their own heart, and not
out of the mouth of the Lord.

No evil shall come upon you.
18 For who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord, and hath perceived
and heard his word? who hath
marked his word, and heard it?
19 Behold, a a whirlwind of the Lord
is gone forth in fury, even a grievous
whirlwind: it shall fall grievously
upon the head of the wicked.
20 The anger of the Lord shall not
return, until he have executed, and
till he have performed the thoughts
of his heart: in the latter days ye
shall consider it perfectly.
21 I have not a sent these b prophets,
yet they ran: I have not spoken to
them, yet they prophesied.
22 But if they had stood in my
counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they
should have turned them from their
evil way, and from the evil of their
doings.

Lord, and not a God afar off?

name, saying, I have dreamed, I
have dreamed.
26 How long shall this be in the
heart of the prophets that prophesy
lies? yea, they are prophets of the
deceit of their own heart;
27 Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their
dreams which they tell every man
to his neighbour, as their fathers
have forgotten my name for Baal.

let him tell a dream; and he that
hath my word, let him speak my
word faithfully. What is the chaff

29 Is not my word like as a fire?
saith the Lord; and like a hammer
that breaketh the rock in pieces?
30 Therefore, behold, I am against
the prophets, saith the Lord, that
steal my words every one from his
neighbour.
31 Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the Lord, that use their
tongues, and say, He saith.
32 Behold, I am against them that
prophesy false a dreams, saith the
Lord, and do tell them, and cause
my people to err by their lies, and
by their lightness; yet I sent them
not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the Lord.
33 ¶ And when this people, or the
prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee,
saying, What is the a burden of the
Lord? thou shalt then say unto
them, What burden? I will even
forsake you, saith the Lord.
34 And as for the prophet, and the
priest, and the people, that shall
say, The burden of the Lord, I will
even punish that man and his house.
35 Thus shall ye say every one to
his neighbour, and every one to his
brother, What hath the Lord answered? and, What hath the Lord
spoken?
36 And the burden of the Lord
shall ye mention no more: for every man’s word shall be his burden;
for ye have perverted the a words
of the living God, of the Lord of
hosts our God.
37 Thus shalt thou say to the
prophet, What hath the Lord answered thee? and, What hath the
Lord spoken?
38 But since ye say, The burden of
the Lord; therefore thus saith the
Lord; Because ye say this word, The
burden of the Lord, and I have sent
unto you, saying, Ye shall not say,
The burden of the Lord;

Chapter 24
Zedekiah and the people of Judah will
be cursed and scattered—Some will be
gathered back from Chaldea to serve
the Lord.
The Lord shewed me, and, behold,
two baskets of figs were set before
the temple of the Lord, after that
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon
had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of a Jehoiakim king of
Judah, and the b princes of Judah,
with the carpenters and smiths,
from Jerusalem, and had brought
them to c Babylon.
2 One basket had very good figs,
even like the a  figs that are first
ripe: and the other basket had very
b 
naughty figs, which could not be
eaten, they were so bad.
3 Then said the Lord unto me,
What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I
said, Figs; the good figs, very good;
and the evil, very evil, that cannot
be eaten, they are so evil.
4 ¶ Again the word of the Lord
came unto me, saying,
5 Thus saith the Lord, the God of
Israel; Like these good figs, so will I
acknowledge them that are carried
away captive of Judah, whom I have
sent out of this place into the land
of the Chaldeans for their a good.
6 For I will set mine eyes upon them
for good, and I will a bring them again
to this b land: and I will build them,
and not pull them down; and I will
c 
plant them, and not pluck them up.

unto me with their whole heart.
8 ¶ And as the evil figs, which
cannot be eaten, they are so evil;
surely thus saith the Lord, So will
I give Zedekiah the king of Judah,
and his princes, and the a residue
of Jerusalem, that remain in this
land, and them that dwell in the
land of Egypt:
9 And I will deliver them to be

Captive Judah will serve Babylon for
seventy years—Various nations will be
overthrown—In the last days, all the
inhabitants of the earth will be at war.
The word that came to Jeremiah
concerning all the people of Judah
in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the
son of Josiah king of Judah, that
was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;
2 The which Jeremiah the prophet
spake unto all the people of Judah,
and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,
3 From the thirteenth a year of
Josiah the son of Amon king of
Judah, even unto this day, that is
the three and twentieth year, the
word of the Lord hath come unto
me, and I have spoken unto you,
rising early and speaking; but ye
have not hearkened.

4 And the Lord hath sent unto
you all his servants the a prophets,
rising early and sending them; but
ye have not hearkened, nor inclined
your ear to hear.
5 They said, Turn ye again now
every one from his evil way, and
from the evil of your doings, and
dwell in the land that the Lord
hath given unto you and to your
fathers for ever and ever:
6 And go not after other gods to
serve them, and to worship them,
and provoke me not to anger with
the works of your hands; and I will
do you no hurt.
7 Yet ye have not hearkened unto
me, saith the Lord; that ye might
provoke me to anger with the works
of your hands to your own hurt.
8 ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord
of hosts; Because ye have not a heard
my words,
9 Behold, I will a send and take
all the families of the north, saith
the Lord, and b Nebuchadrezzar
the king of c Babylon, my servant,
and will bring them against this
land, and against the inhabitants
thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly

destroy them, and make them an

10 Moreover I will take from them
the voice of a mirth, and the voice
of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride,
the sound of the millstones, and
the light of the candle.
11 And this whole land shall be

make it perpetual desolations.
13 And I will bring upon that
land all my words which I have
pronounced against it, even all that
is written in this book, which Jere­

the nations.
14 For many nations and great
kings shall a serve themselves of
them also: and I will recompense
them according to their deeds, and
according to the works of their own

had sent me:

28 And it shall be, if they refuse

33 And the a slain of the Lord shall
be at that day from one end of the
earth even unto the other end of the

34 ¶ Howl, ye a shepherds, and cry;
and wallow yourselves in the ashes,
ye principal of the flock: for the
days of your slaughter and of your
b 
dispersions are accomplished; and
ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel.
35 And the shepherds shall have
no way to flee, nor the principal of
the flock to escape.
36 A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard:
for the Lord hath spoiled their

37 And the peaceable habitations
are cut down because of the fierce

that I may a repent me of the evil,
which I purpose to do unto them
because of the evil of their doings.
4 And thou shalt say unto them,

5 To hearken to the words of my

a 
Shiloh, and will make this city a

7 So the priests and the prophets
and all the people heard Jeremiah
speaking these words in the house
of the Lord.
8 ¶ Now it came to pass, when Jere­

all that the Lord had commanded
him to speak unto all the people,
that the priests and the prophets
and all the people took him, saying,
Thou shalt surely a die.
9 Why hast thou prophesied in

city shall be a desolate without an

10 ¶ When the a princes of Judah

12 ¶ Then spake Jeremiah unto
all the princes and to all the people, saying, The Lord sent me to
prophesy against this house and
against this city all the words that
ye have heard.
13 Therefore now amend your ways
and your doings, and obey the voice
of the Lord your God; a and the Lord
will repent him of the evil that he
hath pronounced against you.
14 As for me, behold, I am in your
a

and meet unto you.
15 But know ye for certain, that if
ye put me to death, ye shall surely
bring a innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon
the inhabitants thereof: for of a
truth the Lord hath sent me unto
you to speak all these words in
your ears.
16 ¶ Then said the princes and all
the people unto the priests and to
the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us
in the name of the Lord our God.
17 Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all
the assembly of the people, saying,
18 a Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of
Judah, and spake to all the people
of Judah, saying, Thus saith the Lord

did he not fear the Lord, a and besought the Lord, and the Lord
repented him of the evil which

Thus might we procure great evil
against our souls.
20 And there was also a man that
prophesied in the name of the
Lord, Urijah the son of Shemaiah
of Kirjath-jearim, who a prophesied
against this city and against this
land according to all the words of
Jeremiah:
21 And when a Jehoiakim the king,
with all his mighty men, and all the
princes, heard his words, the king
sought to put him to death: but when
Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and
fled, and went into Egypt;
22 And Jehoiakim the king sent
men into Egypt, namely, a Elnathan
the son of Achbor, and certain men
with him into Egypt.
23 And they fetched forth Urijah
out of Egypt, and brought him unto
Jehoiakim the king; who a slew him
with the sword, and cast his dead
body into the graves of the common people.
24 Nevertheless the hand of a Ahikam the son of b Shaphan was with
Jeremiah, that they should not give
him into the hand of the people to
put him to death.
Chapter 27
The Lord sends word to many nations

Edom, and to the king of Moab,
and to the king of the Ammonites,
and to the king of Tyrus, and to the

messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;
4 And command them to say unto
their masters, Thus saith the Lord of

ye say unto your masters;
5 I have made the a earth, the man
and the beast that are upon the
ground, by my great power and by
my outstretched arm, and have
b 
given it unto whom it seemed meet
unto me.
6 And now have I a given all these
lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my
servant; and the b beasts of the field
have I given him also to serve him.
7 And all a  nations shall serve
him, and his son, and his son’s son,

will not put their neck under the

words, saying, Bring your necks

13 Why will ye die, thou and thy

19 ¶ For thus saith the Lord of
hosts concerning the a pillars, and
concerning the b sea, and concerning the c bases, and concerning the
residue of the vessels that remain
in this city,
20 Which Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon took not, when he carried
away captive a Jeconiah the son of
Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles
of Judah and Jerusalem;
21 Yea, thus saith the Lord of hosts,
the God of Israel, concerning the
vessels that remain in the house of
the Lord, and in the house of the
king of Judah and of Jerusalem;
22 They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until
the day that I visit them, saith the
Lord; then will I a bring them up,
and restore them to this place.
Chapter 28
Hananiah prophesies falsely that the
Babylonian yoke will be broken.
And it came to pass the same year,
in the beginning of the reign of
Zedekiah king of Judah, in the
fourth year, and in the fifth month,
that Hananiah the son of Azur the
prophet, which was of Gibeon, spake
unto me in the house of the Lord,
in the presence of the priests and
of all the people, saying,
2 Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts,
the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
3 Within two full years will I bring
again into this place all the vessels
of the Lord’s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away
from this place, and carried them
to Babylon:
4 And I will bring again to this
place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim
king of Judah, with all the captives

of Judah, that went into Babylon,
saith the Lord: for I will break the
yoke of the king of Babylon.
5 ¶ Then the prophet Jeremiah
said unto the prophet Hananiah in
the presence of the priests, and
in the presence of all the people
that stood in the house of the Lord,
6 Even the prophet Jeremiah said,
Amen: the Lord do so: the Lord
perform thy words which thou
hast prophesied, to bring again the
vessels of the Lord’s house, and all
that is carried away captive, from
Babylon into this place.
7 Nevertheless hear thou now this
word that I speak in thine ears, and
in the ears of all the people;
8 The prophets that have been
before me and before thee of old
prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of
war, and of evil, and of pestilence.
9 The prophet which a prophesieth of b peace, when the word of
the prophet shall come to pass, then
shall the c prophet be known, that
the Lord hath truly sent him.
10 ¶ Then Hananiah the prophet
took the a yoke from off the prophet
Jeremiah’s neck, and brake it.
11 And Hananiah spake in the
presence of all the people, saying,
Thus saith the Lord; Even so will
I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck
of all nations within the space of
two full years. And the prophet
Jeremiah went his way.
12 ¶ Then the word of the Lord
came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after that Hananiah the prophet had
broken the yoke from off the neck
of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
13 Go and tell Hananiah, saying,
Thus saith the Lord; Thou hast
broken the yokes of wood; but
thou shalt make for them yokes
of iron.
14 For thus saith the Lord of hosts,

Ezra 1:7.

Ezek. 13:10 (9–10).

these nations, that they may serve
b 
Nebuchadnezzar king of Bab­ylon;
and they shall serve him: and I
have given him the c beasts of the
field also.
15 ¶ Then said the a prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet,
Hear now, Hananiah; The Lord hath
not sent thee; but thou makest this
people to trust in a b lie.
16 Therefore thus saith the Lord;
Behold, I will cast thee from off
the face of the earth: this year thou
shalt a die, because thou hast taught
rebellion against the Lord.
17 So Hananiah the prophet died
the same year in the seventh month.
Chapter 29
Jeremiah tells the Jews in Babylon to
prepare for seventy years of captivity—
Those remaining in Jerusalem will yet
be scattered—Shemaiah prophesies
falsely and is cursed.
Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent
from Jerusalem unto the residue
of the elders which were carried
away captives, and to the priests,
and to the prophets, and to all the
people whom Nebuchadnezzar had
carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;
2 (After that a Jeconiah the king,
and the queen, and the b eunuchs,
the c princes of Judah and Jerusalem,
and the carpenters, and the smiths,
were departed from Jerusalem;)

6 Take ye wives, and beget sons

7 And seek the a peace of the city
whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto

thereof shall ye have peace.

be in the midst of you, deceive you,
neither hearken to your b dreams

9 For they a prophesy falsely unto

12 Then shall ye a call upon me, and
ye shall go and pray unto me,
and I will b hearken unto you.

captivity, and I will a gather you
from all the nations, and from all
the places whither I have driven
you, saith the Lord; and I will bring
you again into the place whence
I caused you to be carried away
captive.
15 ¶ Because ye have said, The
Lord hath raised us up prophets
in Babylon;
16 Know that thus saith the Lord
of the king that sitteth upon the
throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, and
of your brethren that are not gone
forth with you into captivity;
17 Thus saith the Lord of hosts;
Behold, I will send upon them the
sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile
figs, that cannot be eaten, they are
so a evil.
18 And I will a persecute them with
the sword, with the famine, and with
the pestilence, and will deliver them
to be b removed to all the kingdoms
of the earth, to be a curse, and an
astonishment, and an hissing, and
a reproach, among all the nations
whither I have driven them:
19 Because they have not heark­
ened to my words, saith the Lord,
which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early
and sending them; but ye would not
hear, saith the Lord.
20 ¶ Hear ye therefore the word
of the Lord, all ye of the captivity,
whom I have sent from Jerusalem
to Babylon:
21 Thus saith the Lord of hosts,
the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of
Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son
of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie
unto you in my name; Behold, I will
deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he
shall slay them before your eyes;
22 And of them shall be taken
up a curse by all the captivity of
Judah which are in Babylon, saying,

Israel, Judah, People of.
	17	a	 or  bad.

The Lord make thee like Zedekiah
and like Ahab, whom the king of
Babylon roasted in the fire;
23 Because they have committed
a 
villany in Israel, and have committed b adultery with their neighbours’
wives, and have spoken lying words
in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am
a witness, saith the Lord.
24 ¶ Thus shalt thou also speak to
Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,
25 Thus speaketh the Lord of
hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy
name unto all the people that are
at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the
son of Maaseiah the priest, and to
all the priests, saying,
26 The Lord hath made thee priest
in the stead of Jehoiada the priest,
that ye should be officers in the
house of the Lord, for every man
that is mad, and maketh himself a
prophet, that thou shouldest put
him in prison, and in the stocks.
27 Now therefore why hast thou
not reproved Jeremiah of a Anathoth,
which maketh himself a prophet
to you?
28 For therefore he sent unto us
in Babylon, saying, This captivity is
long: build ye houses, and dwell in
them; and plant gardens, and eat the
fruit of them.
29 And Zephaniah the priest read
this letter in the ears of Jeremiah
the prophet.
30 ¶ Then came the word of the
Lord unto Jeremiah, saying,
31 Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the Lord concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite;
Because that Shemaiah hath prophe­sied unto you, and I sent him not,
and he caused you to trust in a a lie:
32 Therefore thus saith the Lord;
Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the
Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall
not have a man to dwell among this
people; neither shall he behold the

Chapter 30
In the last days, Judah and Israel will
be gathered to their own lands—David, their king (the Messiah), will reign
over them.
The word that came to Jeremiah
from the Lord, saying,
2 Thus speaketh the Lord God of
Israel, saying, Write thee all the
words that I have spoken unto thee
in a book.
3 For, lo, the days come, saith the
Lord, that I will bring again the
captivity of my people a Israel and
Judah, saith the Lord: and I will
cause them to b return to the land
that I gave to their fathers, and they
shall possess it.
4 ¶ And these are the words that
the Lord spake concerning Israel
and concerning Judah.
5 For thus saith the Lord; We have
heard a voice of trembling, of fear,
and not of peace.
6 Ask ye now, and see whether a man
doth travail with child? wherefore do
I see every man with his hands on
his loins, as a woman in travail, and
all faces are turned into paleness?
7 Alas! for that a day is great, so
that none is like it: it is even the
time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall
be saved out of it.
8 For it shall come to pass in that
day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I
will break his a yoke from off thy
neck, and will burst thy bonds,
and strangers shall no more b serve
themselves of him:

whom I will raise up unto them.
10 ¶ Therefore fear thou not, O my
servant Jacob, saith the Lord; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo,
I will a save thee from afar, and thy
seed from the land of their captivity;
and Jacob shall return, and shall be
in rest, and be quiet, and none shall
make him afraid.
11 For I am with thee, saith the
Lord, to save thee: though I make
a full a end of all nations whither I
have scattered thee, yet will I not
make a full end of thee: but I will
correct thee in measure, and will not
leave thee altogether unpunished.
12 For thus saith the Lord, a Thy
bruise is incurable, and thy wound
is grievous.
13 There is none to plead thy cause,
that thou mayest be bound up: thou
hast no healing medicines.
14 All thy a lovers have forgotten
thee; they seek thee not; for I have

for the multitude of thine iniquity:
because thy c sins were increased, I
have done these things unto thee.
16 Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and
all thine adversaries, every one of
them, shall go into captivity; and
they that spoil thee shall be a spoil,
and all that prey upon thee will I
give for a prey.

they called thee an Outcast, saying,
This is Zion, whom no man seeketh
after.
18 ¶ Thus saith the Lord; Behold,
I will bring again the captivity of
Jacob’s tents, and have a mercy on his
dwellingplaces; and the city shall
be builded upon her own heap, and
b 
the palace shall remain after the
manner thereof.
19 And out of them shall proceed
thanksgiving and the voice of them
that make merry: and I will a multiply them, and they shall not be
few; I will also glorify them, and
they shall not be b small.
20 Their children also shall be as
aforetime, and their congregation
shall be established before me, and
I will punish all that oppress them.
21 And their nobles shall be of
a 
themselves, and their governor
shall proceed from the midst of
them; and I will cause him to b draw
near, and he shall approach unto
me: for who is this that engaged his
heart to approach unto me? saith
the Lord.
22 And ye shall be my a people,
and I will be your God.

Lord goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with

At the same time, saith the Lord,

2 Thus saith the Lord, The people
which were left of the sword found

when I went to cause him to rest.
3 The Lord hath appeared a of old
unto me, saying, Yea, I have b loved
thee with an everlasting c love: therefore with lovingkindness have I

way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a b father to Israel, and
c 
Ephraim is my d firstborn.
10 ¶ Hear the word of the Lord, O
ye nations, and declare it in the isles
afar off, and say, He that scattered
Israel will a gather him, and keep
him, as a shepherd doth his flock.
11 For the Lord hath redeemed
Jacob, and a ransomed him from
the hand of him that was stronger
than he.
12 Therefore they shall come and
sing in the height of Zion, and shall
flow together to the goodness of the
Lord, for wheat, and for wine, and
for oil, and for the young of the flock
and of the herd: and their soul shall
be as a watered garden; and they
shall not a sorrow any more at all.
13 Then shall the virgin rejoice
in the dance, both young men and
old together: for I will turn their
a 
mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice
from their sorrow.
14 And I will satiate the soul of
the priests with fatness, and my
people shall be satisfied with my
a 
goodness, saith the Lord.
15 ¶ Thus saith the Lord; A voice
was heard in a Ramah, lamentation,
and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping
for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because
they were not.
16 Thus saith the Lord; Refrain
thy voice from weeping, and thine
eyes from tears: for thy work shall
be a rewarded, saith the Lord; and
they shall come again from the land
of the enemy.
17 And there is hope a in thine
b 
end, saith the Lord, that thy children shall come again to their own
border.

bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast

chastised me, and I was chastised,
as a bullock unaccustomed to the
yoke: a turn thou me, and I shall be
turned; for thou art the Lord my
God.
19 Surely a after that I was turned,
I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I
was ashamed, yea, even confounded,
because I did bear the reproach of
my youth.
20 Is Ephraim my dear son? is he
a 
a pleasant child? for since I spake
against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels
are troubled for him; I will surely
have mercy upon him, saith the
Lord.
21 Set thee up waymarks, make
thee a high heaps: set thine heart
toward the highway, even the way
which thou wentest: turn again, O
virgin of Israel, turn again to these
thy cities.
22 ¶ How long wilt thou go about,
O thou a backsliding daughter? for
the Lord hath created a new thing
in the earth, A woman shall compass a man.
23 Thus saith the Lord of hosts,
the God of Israel; As yet they shall
use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when
I shall bring again their captivity;
The Lord bless thee, O habitation
of justice, and mountain of holiness.
24 And there shall dwell in Judah
itself, and in all the cities thereof
together, husbandmen, and they
that go forth with flocks.
25 For I have satiated the weary
soul, and I have replenished every
sorrowful soul.
26 Upon this I awaked, and beheld;
and my sleep was sweet unto me.

and to throw down, and to destroy,
and to afflict; so will I d watch over
them, to build, and to plant, saith
the Lord.
29 In those days they shall say no
more, The fathers have eaten a sour
a 
grape, and the children’s teeth are
set on edge.
30 But every one shall a die for his
own b iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall
be set on edge.
31 ¶ Behold, the days come, saith
the Lord, that I will make a a new
b 
covenant with the house of c Israel,
and with the house of Judah:
32 Not according to the a covenant
that I made with their fathers in the
day that I took them by the hand
to bring them out of the land of
Egypt; which my covenant they
brake, although I was an husband
unto them, saith the Lord:
33 But this shall be the a covenant
that I will make with the house of
Israel; After those days, saith the
Lord, I will put my b law in their
inward parts, and write it in their
c 
hearts; and will be their God, and
they shall be my people.
34 And they shall teach no more
every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know
the Lord: for they shall all a know
me, from the least of them unto the
greatest of them, saith the Lord: for
I will forgive their b iniquity, and I
will remember their sin no more.
35 ¶ Thus saith the Lord, which

Jeremiah 32:2–20

was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.
2 For then the king of Babylon’s
army a besieged Jerusalem: and Jere­
miah the prophet was shut up in
the court of the prison, which was
in the king of Judah’s house.
3 For Zedekiah king of Judah had
shut him up, saying, Wherefore
dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus
saith the Lord, Behold, I will give
this city into the hand of the king
of Babylon, and he shall take it;
4 And Zedekiah king of Judah
shall not escape out of the hand of
the Chaldeans, but shall surely be
delivered into the hand of the king
of Babylon, and shall speak with
him mouth to mouth, and his eyes
shall behold his eyes;
5 And he shall lead Zedekiah to
a 
Babylon, and there shall he be
until I visit him, saith the Lord:
though ye fight with the Chaldeans,
ye shall not prosper?
6 ¶ And Jeremiah said, The word
of the Lord came unto me, saying,
7 Behold, Hanameel the son of
Shallum thine uncle shall come
unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field
that is in Anathoth: for the right of
redemption is thine to buy it.
8 So Hanameel mine uncle’s son
came to me in the court of the prison
according to the word of the Lord,
and said unto me, Buy my field, I
pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which
is in the country of Benjamin: for
the right of inheritance is thine,
and the redemption is thine; buy
it for thyself. Then I knew that this
was the word of the Lord.
9 And I bought the field of Hana­
meel my uncle’s son, that was in
Anathoth, and a weighed him the
money, even seventeen shekels of
silver.
10 And I subscribed the evidence,
and sealed it, and took witnesses,
and weighed him the money in the
balances.

11 So I took the evidence of the
purchase, both that which was sealed
according to the law and custom,
and that which was open:
12 And I gave the evidence of the
purchase unto a Baruch the son of
Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the
sight of Hanameel mine uncle’s son,
and in the presence of the witnesses
that subscribed the b book of the
purchase, before all the Jews that
sat in the court of the prison.
13 ¶ And I charged Baruch before
them, saying,
14 Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the
God of Israel; Take these a evidences,
this evidence of the purchase,
both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them
in an earthen vessel, that they may
continue many days.
15 For thus saith the Lord of hosts,
the God of Israel; Houses and fields
and vineyards shall be possessed
again in this land.
16 ¶ Now when I had delivered
the evidence of the purchase unto
Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed
unto the Lord, saying,
17 Ah Lord God! behold, thou hast
made the heaven and the earth by
thy great power and stretched out
arm, and there is nothing too a hard
for thee:
18 Thou shewest lovingkindness
unto thousands, and recompensest
the iniquity of the fathers into the
bosom of their children after them:
the Great, the Mighty God, the Lord
of hosts, is his name,
19 Great in counsel, and mighty in
work: for thine eyes are open upon
all the ways of the sons of men: to
a 
give every one according to his
b 
ways, and according to the fruit
of his doings:
20 Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto
this day, and in Israel, and among
other men; and hast made thee a

21 And hast brought forth thy
people Israel out of the land of
Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and
with a stretched out arm, and with
great terror;
22 And hast given them this land,
which thou didst swear to their
fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
23 And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy
voice, neither walked in thy law;
they have done nothing of all that
thou commandedst them to do:
therefore thou hast caused all this
evil to come upon them:
24 Behold the mounts, they are
come unto the city to take it; and
the city is given into the hand of
the Chaldeans, that fight against
it, because of the sword, and of the
famine, and of the pestilence: and
what thou hast spoken is come to
pass; and, behold, thou seest it.
25 And thou hast said unto me,
O Lord God, Buy thee the field for
money, and take witnesses; for the
city is given into the hand of the
Chaldeans.
26 ¶ Then came the word of the
Lord unto Jeremiah, saying,
27 Behold, I am the Lord, the God
of all flesh: is there any thing too
hard for me?
28 Therefore thus saith the Lord;
Behold, I will give this city into the
hand of the Chaldeans, and into
the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king
of Babylon, and he shall take it:
29 And the Chaldeans, that fight
against this city, shall come and set
fire on this city, and burn it with
the houses, upon whose a roofs they
have offered incense unto Baal, and
poured out drink offerings unto
other gods, to provoke me to anger.
30 For the children of Israel and
the children of Judah have only done
evil before me from their youth: for

the children of Israel have only provoked me to a anger with the work
of their hands, saith the Lord.
31 For this city hath been to me as
a provocation of mine anger and of
my fury from the day that they built
it even unto this day; that I should
remove it from before my face,
32 Because of all the evil of the
children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done
to provoke me to anger, they, their
kings, their princes, their priests,
and their prophets, and the men
of Judah, and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem.
33 And they have turned unto me
the a back, and not the face: though
I taught them, rising up early and
teaching them, yet they have not
hearkened to receive instruction.
34 But they set their abominations
in a the house, which is called by
my name, to defile it.
35 And they built the high places
of Baal, which are in the valley of the
son of Hinnom, to cause their sons
and their daughters to pass through
the a fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it
into my mind, that they should do
this abomination, to cause Judah
to sin.
36 ¶ And now therefore thus saith
the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It
shall be delivered into the hand of
the king of Babylon by the sword,
and by the famine, and by the pestilence;
37 Behold, I will a gather them out of
all countries, whither I have driven
them in mine anger, and in my
fury, and in great wrath; and I will
b 
bring them again unto this place,
and I will cause them to dwell safely:
38 And they shall be my people,
and I will be their God:
39 And I will give them one a heart,
and one way, that they may fear me

for ever, for the b good of them, and
of their children after them:
40 And I will make an a everlasting b covenant with them, that I will
not turn away from them, to do
them good; but I will put my fear
in their hearts, that they shall not
depart from me.
41 Yea, I will rejoice over them to
do them good, and I will plant them
in this land assuredly with my whole
heart and with my whole soul.
42 For thus saith the Lord; Like
as I have brought all this great evil
upon this people, so will I bring
upon them all the good that I have
promised them.
43 And fields shall be bought in
this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate without man or beast; it is given
into the hand of the Chaldeans.
44 Men shall buy fields for money,
and subscribe evidences, and a seal
them, and take witnesses in the
land of Benjamin, and in the places
about Jerusalem, and in the cities
of Judah, and in the cities of the
mountains, and in the cities of the

Chapter 33
Judah and Israel will be gathered—The
Branch of Righteousness (the Messiah)
is promised—The Seed of David (the
Messiah) will reign forever.
Moreover the word of the Lord
came unto Jeremiah the second
time, while he was yet shut up in
the court of the prison, saying,
2 Thus saith the Lord the maker
thereof, the Lord that formed it, to
establish it; the Lord is his name;
3 Call unto me, and I will answer
thee, and a shew thee great and
mighty things, which thou knowest not.

of Israel, concerning the houses of
this city, and concerning the houses
of the kings of Judah, which are
thrown down by the mounts, and
by the sword;
5 They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the
dead bodies of men, whom I have
slain in mine anger and in my fury,
and for all whose wickedness I have
hid my face from this city.
6 Behold, I will bring it health and
cure, and I will cure them, and will
reveal unto them the abundance of
peace and truth.
7 And I will cause the captivity
of Judah and the captivity of Israel
to a return, and will build them, as
at the first.
8 And I will a cleanse them from
all their iniquity, whereby they
have sinned against me; and I will
pardon all their iniquities, whereby
they have sinned, and whereby they
have transgressed against me.
9 ¶ And it shall be to me a name
of joy, a a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth,
which shall hear all the good that
I do unto them: and they shall fear
and tremble for all the goodness and
for all the prosperity that I procure
unto it.
10 Thus saith the Lord; Again
there shall be heard in this place,
which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even
in the cities of Judah, and in the
streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without
inhabitant, and without beast,
11 The voice of joy, and the voice
of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride,
the voice of them that shall say,
Praise the Lord of hosts: for the
Lord is good; for his mercy endureth

12 Thus saith the Lord of hosts;
Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast,
and in all the cities thereof, shall be
an habitation of shepherds causing
their flocks to a lie down.
13 In the cities of the mountains,
in the cities of the vale, and in the
cities of the south, and in the land
of Benjamin, and in the places
about Jerusalem, and in the cities
of Judah, shall the flocks pass again
under the hands of him that a telleth them, saith the Lord.
14 Behold, the days come, saith
the Lord, that I will a perform that
good thing which I have b promised
unto the house of Israel and to the
house of Judah.
15 ¶ In those days, and at that time,
will I cause the a Branch of righteousness to grow up unto b David;
and he shall c execute judgment and
righteousness in the d land.
16 In those days shall Judah be
saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell
safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The Lord
our righteousness.
17 ¶ For thus saith the Lord; David shall never a want a man to sit
upon the throne of the house of
Israel;
18 Neither shall the priests the
Levites want a man before me to
offer burnt offerings, and to kindle
meat offerings, and to do sacrifice
continually.
19 ¶ And the word of the Lord
came unto Jeremiah, saying,
20 Thus saith the Lord; If ye can
break my covenant of the day, and
my covenant of the night, and that
there should not be day and a night
in their season;
21 Then may also my covenant
be broken with David my servant,

22 As the host of heaven cannot be
numbered, neither the sand of the
sea measured: so will I multiply
the seed of David my servant, and
the Levites that minister unto me.
23 Moreover the word of the Lord
came to Jeremiah, saying,
24 Considerest thou not what this
people have spoken, saying, The
two families which the Lord hath
chosen, he hath even cast them off?
thus they have despised my people,
that they should be no more a nation before them.
25 Thus saith the Lord; If my covenant be not with day and night,
and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;
26 Then will I cast away the seed
of Jacob, and David my servant, so
that I will not take any of his seed to
be rulers over the seed of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause
their captivity to return, and have
mercy on them.

Jeremiah prophesies the captivity of Zedekiah—The people of Judah will be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.

all his army, and all the kingdoms
of the earth of his dominion, and
all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and a against all the cities
thereof, saying,
2 Thus saith the Lord, the God of
Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah
king of Judah, and tell him, Thus
saith the Lord; Behold, I will give
this city into the hand of the king
of a Babylon, and he shall burn it
with fire:

and delivered into his hand; and
thine eyes shall behold the eyes of
the king of a Babylon, and he shall
speak with thee mouth to mouth,
and thou shalt go to Babylon.
4 Yet hear the word of the Lord,
O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus
saith the Lord of thee, Thou shalt
not die by the sword:
5 But thou shalt die in peace: and
with the burnings of thy fathers,
the former kings which were before
thee, so shall they burn odours for
thee; and they will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced
the word, saith the Lord.
6 Then Jeremiah the prophet spake
all these words unto Zedekiah king
of Judah in Jerusalem,
7 When the king of Babylon’s
army fought against Jerusalem,
and against all the cities of Judah
that were left, against Lachish, and
against Azekah: for these defenced
cities remained of the cities of Judah.
8 ¶ This is the word that came
unto Jeremiah from the Lord, after
that the king Zedekiah had made a
covenant with all the people which
were at Jerusalem, to proclaim a liberty unto them;
9 That every man should let his
manservant, and every man his
maidservant, being an Hebrew or
an Hebrewess, go free; that none
should a serve himself of them, to
wit, of a Jew his brother.
10 Now when all the princes, and
all the people, which had entered
into the covenant, heard that every
one should let his manservant, and
every one his maidservant, go free,
that none should serve themselves of
them any more, then they obeyed,
and let them go.
11 But afterward they a turned,
and caused the servants and the
handmaids, whom they had let go
free, to return, and brought them
into subjection for servants and for
handmaids.

12 ¶ Therefore the word of the
Lord came to Jeremiah from the
Lord, saying,
13 Thus saith the Lord, the God of
Israel; I made a covenant with your
fathers in the day that I brought
them forth out of the land of Egypt,
out of the house of bondmen,
saying,
14 At the end of a seven years let
ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto
thee; and when he hath served
thee six years, thou shalt let him
go free from thee: but your fathers
hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.
15 And ye were now turned, and
had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his
neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which
is called by my name:
16 But ye turned and a polluted my
name, and caused every man his
servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had set at liberty
at their pleasure, to return, and
brought them into subjection, to
be unto you for servants and for
handmaids.
17 Therefore thus saith the Lord;
Ye have not hearkened unto me, in
proclaiming a liberty, every one to
his brother, and every man to his
neighbour: behold, I proclaim a
liberty for you, saith the Lord, to
the sword, to the pestilence, and
to the famine; and I will make you
to be removed into all the kingdoms
of the earth.
18 And I will give the men that
have transgressed my covenant,
which have not performed the
words of the covenant which they
had made before me, when they

20 I will even a give them into the
hand of their enemies, and into
the hand of them that seek their life:
and their dead bodies shall be for
meat unto the fowls of the heaven,
and to the beasts of the earth.
21 And Zedekiah king of Judah
and his princes will I give into the
hand of their enemies, and into
the hand of them that seek their
life, and into the hand of the king
of Babylon’s army, which are gone
up from you.
22 Behold, I will command, saith
the Lord, and cause them to return
to this city; and they shall fight
against it, and take it, and burn it
with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without
an inhabitant.
Chapter 35
The Rechabites are commended and
blessed for their obedience.
The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of
Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of
Judah, saying,
2 Go unto the house of the a Rechabites, and speak unto them, and
bring them into the house of the
Lord, into one of the chambers,
and give them wine to drink.
3 Then I took Jaazaniah the son of
Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and
his brethren, and all his sons, and
the whole house of the Rechabites;
4 And I brought them into the
house of the Lord, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son
of Igdaliah, a man of God, which
was by the chamber of the princes,
which was above the chamber of
Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the
keeper of the door:
5 And I set before the sons of the
house of the Rechabites pots full
of wine, and cups, and I said unto
them, Drink ye wine.
	20	a	 Jer. 22:25.
35	2	a	 2 Kgs. 10:15;

6 But they said, We will drink no
wine: for a Jonadab the son of Rechab
our father commanded us, saying,
Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye,
nor your sons for ever:
7 Neither shall ye build house,
nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard,
nor have any: but all your days ye
shall dwell in tents; that ye may
live many days in the land where
ye be strangers.
8 Thus have we obeyed the voice
of Jonadab the son of Rechab our
father in all that he hath charged us,
to drink no wine all our days, we, our
wives, our sons, nor our daughters;
9 Nor to build houses for us to
dwell in: neither have we vineyard,
nor field, nor seed:
10 But we have dwelt in tents, and
have obeyed, and done according
to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
11 But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up
into the land, that we said, Come,
and let us go to Jerusalem for fear
of the army of the Chaldeans, and
for fear of the army of the Syrians:
so we dwell at Jerusalem.
12 ¶ Then came the word of the
Lord unto Jeremiah, saying,
13 Thus saith the Lord of hosts,
the God of Israel; Go and tell the
men of Judah and the inhabitants
of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words?
saith the Lord.

not after other gods to serve them,
and ye shall dwell in the land which
I have given to you and to your
fathers: but ye have not inclined
your ear, nor hearkened unto me.
16 Because the sons of Jonadab
the son of Rechab have performed
the commandment of their father,
which he commanded them; but this
people hath not hearkened unto me:
17 Therefore thus saith the Lord
God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and
upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I
have spoken unto them, but they
have not a heard; and I have called
unto them, but they have not answered.
18 ¶ And Jeremiah said unto the
house of the Rechabites, Thus saith
the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the
commandment of Jonadab your
father, and kept all his precepts,
and done according unto all that
he hath commanded you:
19 Therefore thus saith the Lord
of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab
the son of Rechab shall not want
a man to stand before me for ever.
Chapter 36
Baruch writes the prophecies of Jeremiah and reads them in the house of
the Lord—Jehoiakim, the king, burns
the book, and judgment comes upon
him—Jeremiah dictates the prophecies
again and adds many more.
And it came to pass in the fourth
year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word
came unto Jeremiah from the Lord,
saying,
2 Take thee a a roll of a book, and
write therein all the words that I
have spoken unto thee against Israel,
and against Judah, and against all
the nations, from the day I spake

unto thee, from the days of Josiah,
even unto this b day.
3 It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I
purpose to do unto them; that they
may return every man from his evil
way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the
son of Neriah: and a Baruch b wrote
from the mouth of Jeremiah all
the words of the Lord, which he
had spoken unto him, upon a roll
of a book.
5 And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am a shut up; I cannot go into the house of the Lord:
6 Therefore go thou, and read in the
roll, which thou hast written from
my mouth, the words of the Lord
in the ears of the people in the
Lord’s house upon the a fasting day:
and also thou shalt read them in the
ears of all Judah that come out of
their cities.
7 It may be they will present their
supplication before the Lord, and
will a return every one from his evil
way: for great is the anger and the
fury that the Lord hath pronounced
against this people.
8 And Baruch the son of Neriah did
according to all that Jeremiah the
prophet commanded him, reading
in the book the words of the Lord
in the Lord’s house.
9 And it came to pass in the fifth
year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah
king of Judah, in the ninth month,
that they proclaimed a fast before
the Lord to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that
came from the cities of Judah unto
Jerusalem.
10 Then read Baruch in the book
the words of Jeremiah in the house
of the Lord, in the chamber of
Gemariah the son of a Shaphan the
scribe, in the higher court, at the
entry of the new gate of the Lord’s
house, in the ears of all the people.

11 ¶ When Michaiah the son of
Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had
heard out of the book all the words
of the Lord,
12 Then he went down into the
king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber: and, lo, all the a princes sat there,
even Elishama the scribe, and Del­
aiah the son of Shemaiah, and b Elnathan the son of Achbor, and
Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and
Zedekiah the son of Hananiah,
and all the princes.
13 Then Michaiah declared unto
them all the words that he had
heard, when Baruch read the book
in the ears of the people.
14 Therefore all the princes sent
Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the
son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi,
unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine
hand the roll wherein thou hast
read in the ears of the people, and
come. So Baruch the son of Neriah
took the roll in his hand, and came
unto them.
15 And they said unto him, Sit
down now, and read it in our ears.
So Baruch read it in their ears.
16 Now it came to pass, when they
had heard all the words, they were
a 
afraid both one and other, and said
unto Baruch, We will surely tell the
king of all these words.
17 And they asked Baruch, saying,
Tell us now, How didst thou write
all these words at his mouth?
18 Then Baruch answered them,
He pronounced all these words unto
me with his mouth, and I wrote
them with ink in the book.
19 Then said the princes unto
Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and
Jeremiah; and let no man know
where ye be.
20 ¶ And they went in to the king
into the court, but they laid up the
roll in the chamber of Elishama
the scribe, and told all the words
in the ears of the king.
21 So the king sent Jehudi to fetch
the roll: and he took it out of Eli­
	12	a	 or  officers or officials.

shama the scribe’s chamber. And
Jehudi read it in the ears of the king,
and in the ears of all the princes
which stood beside the king.
22 Now the king sat in the a winterhouse in the ninth month: and
there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.
23 And it came to pass, that when
Jehudi had read three or four leaves,
he cut it with the penknife, and
cast it into the fire that was on the
hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the
hearth.
24 Yet they were not afraid, nor
rent their garments, neither the king,
nor any of his servants that heard
all these words.
25 Nevertheless Elnathan and Del­
aiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would
not burn the roll: but he would not
hear them.
26 But the king commanded Je­
rahmeel the son of a Hammelech,
and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and
Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take
Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the
prophet: but the Lord b hid them.
27 ¶ Then the word of the Lord
came to Jeremiah, after that the
king had burned the roll, and
the words which Baruch wrote at
the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,
28 Take thee again another roll,
and a write in it all the former words
that were in the first roll, which
Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath
burned.
29 And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim
king of Judah, Thus saith the Lord;
Thou hast burned this roll, saying,
Why hast thou written therein,
saying, The king of Babylon shall
certainly come and destroy this
land, and shall cause to cease from
thence man and beast?
30 Therefore thus saith the Lord
of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall
have none to sit upon the throne
of David: and his dead body shall

be cast out in the day to the heat,
and in the night to the frost.
31 And I will punish him and his
seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and
upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
and upon the men of Judah, all the
evil that I have pronounced against
them; but they hearkened not.
32 ¶ Then took Jeremiah another
roll, and gave it to Baruch the
a 
scribe, the son of Neriah; who
wrote therein from the mouth of
Jeremiah all the words of the book
which Jehoiakim king of Judah had
burned in the fire: and there were
b 
added besides unto them many like
words.
Chapter 37
Jeremiah prophesies that Egypt will not
save Judah from Babylon—He is cast
into a dungeon—Zedekiah transfers
him to the court of the prison.
And a king b Zedekiah the son of
Josiah reigned instead of c Coniah
the son of d Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made
king in the land of Judah.
2 But neither he, nor his servants,
nor the people of the land, did
hearken unto the words of the Lord,
which he spake by the prophet
Jeremiah.
3 And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and
Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the
priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the Lord our
God for us.
4 Now Jeremiah came in and went
out among the people: for they had
not put him into prison.
5 Then Pharaoh’s army was come
forth out of Egypt: and when the
Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem
heard tidings of them, they departed
from Jerusalem.

6 ¶ Then came the word of the
Lord unto the prophet Jeremiah,
saying,
7 Thus saith the Lord, the God
of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the
king of Judah, that sent you unto
me to inquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh’s a army, which is come forth
to help you, shall return to b Egypt
into their own land.
8 And the Chaldeans shall come
again, and fight against this city,
and take it, and a burn it with fire.
9 Thus saith the Lord; Deceive
not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us:
for they shall not depart.
10 For though ye had smitten the
whole army of the Chaldeans that
fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among
them, yet should they rise up every
man in his tent, and burn this city
with fire.
11 ¶ And it came to pass, that
when the army of the Chaldeans
was broken up from Jerusalem for
fear of Pharaoh’s army,
12 Then Jeremiah went forth out
of Jerusalem to go into the land
of Benjamin, to separate himself
thence in the midst of the people.
13 And when he was in the gate
of Benjamin, a captain of the ward
was there, whose name was Irijah,
the son of Shelemiah, the son of
Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah
the prophet, saying, Thou a fallest
away to the Chaldeans.
14 Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I
fall not away to the Chaldeans. But
he hearkened not to him: so Irijah
took Jeremiah, and brought him to
the princes.

16 ¶ When Jeremiah was entered
into the dungeon, and into the a cabins, and Jeremiah had remained
there many days;
17 Then Zedekiah the king sent,
and took him out: and the king asked
him secretly in his house, and said,
Is there any word from the Lord?
And Jeremiah said, There is: for,
said he, thou shalt be delivered into
the hand of the king of Babylon.
18 Moreover Jeremiah said unto
king Zedekiah, What have I offended
against thee, or against thy servants,
or against this people, that ye have
put me in prison?
19 Where are now your prophets
which prophesied unto you, saying,
The king of Babylon shall not come
against you, nor against this land?
20 Therefore hear now, I pray thee,
O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not
to return to the house of Jonathan
the scribe, lest I die there.
21 Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit
Jeremiah into the court of the
prison, and that they should give
him daily a piece of a bread out of
the bakers’ street, until all the bread
in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the
prison.
Chapter 38
The rulers cast Jeremiah into a muddy
dungeon—He is freed by Ebed-melech,
an Ethiopian, and put in the court of
the prison—Jeremiah counsels Zedekiah
concerning the war.
Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan,
and Gedaliah the son of a Pashur,
and Jucal the son of Shelemiah,
and b Pashur the son of Malchiah,
heard the words that Jeremiah had
spoken unto all the people, saying,
2 Thus saith the Lord, He that

remaineth in this city shall die by
the sword, by the famine, and by the
pestilence: but he that goeth forth
to the Chaldeans shall live; for he
shall have his life for a prey, and
shall live.
3 Thus saith the Lord, This city
shall surely be given into the hand
of the king of a Babylon’s army,
which shall take it.
4 Therefore the a princes said unto
the king, We beseech thee, let this
man be put to death: for thus he
weakeneth the hands of the men
of war that remain in this city,
and the hands of all the people, in
speaking such words unto them: for
this man seeketh not the b welfare
of this people, but the hurt.
5 Then Zedekiah the king said,
Behold, he is in your hand: for the
king a is not he that can do any thing
against you.
6 Then took they Jeremiah, and
cast him into the dungeon of Mal­
chiah the son of a Hammelech, that
was in the court of the prison: and
they let down Jeremiah with cords.
And in the dungeon there was no
water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk
in the mire.
7 ¶ Now when Ebed-melech the
Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which
was in the king’s house, heard that
they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the
gate of Benjamin;
8 Ebed-melech went forth out of
the king’s house, and spake to the
king, saying,
9 My lord the king, these men have
done evil in all that they have done
to Jeremiah the prophet, whom
they have cast into the dungeon;
and he is like to die for hunger in
the place where he is: for there is
no more a bread in the city.
10 Then the king commanded
Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying,
Take from hence thirty men with

thee, and take up Jeremiah the
prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.
11 So Ebed-melech took the men
with him, and went into the house
of the king under the treasury, and
took thence a old cast clouts and old
rotten rags, and let them down by
cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.
12 And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now
these old cast clouts and rotten rags
under thine armholes under the
cords. And Jeremiah did so.
13 So they drew up Jeremiah with
cords, and took him up out of the
dungeon: and Jeremiah remained
in the court of the prison.
14 ¶ Then Zedekiah the king sent,
and took Jeremiah the prophet unto
him into the third entry that is in
the house of the Lord: and the king
said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee
a thing; hide nothing from me.
15 Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt
thou not surely put me to death?
and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou
not hearken unto me?
16 So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the
Lord liveth, that made us this soul,
I will not put thee to death, neither
will I give thee into the hand of
these men that seek thy life.
17 Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the Lord, the God
of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou
wilt assuredly go forth unto the
king of Babylon’s princes, then thy
soul shall live, and this city shall
not be burned with fire; and thou
shalt live, and thine house:
18 But if thou wilt not go forth to
the king of Babylon’s princes, then
shall this city be given into the
hand of the Chaldeans, and they
shall burn it with fire, and thou
shalt not escape out of their hand.
19 And Zedekiah the king said unto
Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews

	19	a	 heb  have deserted to.

that a are fallen to the Chaldeans,
lest they deliver me into their hand,
and they b mock me.
20 But Jeremiah said, They shall
not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech
thee, the voice of the Lord, which
I speak unto thee: so it shall be well
unto thee, and thy soul shall live.
21 But if thou refuse to go forth,
this is the word that the Lord hath
shewed me:
22 And, behold, all the women that
are left in the king of Judah’s house
shall be brought forth to the king of
Babylon’s princes, and those women
shall say, Thy friends have set thee
on, and have prevailed against thee:
thy feet are sunk in the mire, and
they are turned away back.
23 So they shall bring out all thy
wives and thy a children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out
of their hand, but shalt be taken by
the hand of the king of Babylon:
and thou shalt cause this city to be
burned with fire.
24 ¶ Then said Zedekiah unto Jere­
miah, Let no man know of these
words, and thou shalt not die.
25 But if the princes hear that I
have talked with thee, and they
come unto thee, and say unto thee,
Declare unto us now what thou hast
said unto the king, hide it not from
us, and we will not put thee to death;
also what the king said unto thee:
26 Then thou shalt say unto them,
I presented my supplication before
the king, that he would not cause
me to return to Jonathan’s house,
to die there.
27 Then came all the princes unto
Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told
them according to all these words
that the king had commanded. So
they left off speaking with him; for
the matter was not perceived.
28 So Jeremiah abode in the court
of the prison until the day that
Jerusalem was taken: and he was
there when Jerusalem was taken.

Chapter 39
Jerusalem is taken, and the people are
taken captive—Jeremiah and Ebedmelech, the Ethiopian, are preserved.
In the a ninth year of Zedekiah king
of Judah, in the tenth month, came
Nebuchadrezzar b king of Babylon
and all his army against c Jerusalem,
and they besieged it.
2 And in the eleventh year of
Zede­kiah, in the fourth month, the
ninth day of the month, the city was
broken up.
3 And all the princes of the king
of Babylon came in, and sat in the
middle a gate, even Nergal-sharezer,
Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris,
Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, with all
the residue of the princes of the
king of Babylon.
4 ¶ And it came to pass, that when
a 
Zedekiah the king of Judah saw
them, and all the men of war, then
they fled, and went forth out of the
city by night, by the way of the
king’s garden, by the gate betwixt
the two walls: and he went out the
way of the plain.
5 But the Chaldeans’ army pursued
after them, and overtook a Zedekiah
in the b plains of Jericho: and when
they had taken him, they brought
him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon to Riblah in the land of
Hamath, where he c gave judgment
upon him.
6 Then the king of Babylon a slew
the b sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.
7 Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s
a 
eyes, and bound b him with chains,
to carry him to Babylon.

9 Then Nebuzar-adan the captain
of the guard carried away captive
into Babylon the remnant of the
people that remained in the city,
and those that fell away, that a fell
to him, with the rest of the people
that remained.
10 But a Nebuzar-adan the captain
of the guard left of the poor of the
people, which had nothing, in the
land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
11 ¶ Now Nebuchadrezzar king
of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzar-adan the
captain of the guard, saying,
12 Take him, and a look well to
him, and do him no harm; but
do unto him even as he shall say
unto thee.
13 So Nebuzar-adan the captain of
the guard sent, and Nebushasban,
Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon’s
princes;
14 Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison,
and committed him unto a Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of
Shaphan, that he should carry him
home: so he dwelt among the people.
15 ¶ Now the word of the Lord
came unto Jeremiah, while he was
shut up in the court of the prison,
saying,
16 Go and speak to Ebed-melech

Chapter 40
The king of Babylon makes Gedaliah governor over the remnant left in
Judah—Jeremiah is freed and dwells
among them.
The word that came to Jeremiah
from the Lord, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let
him go from Ramah, when he had
taken him being bound in chains
among all that were carried away
captive of Jerusalem and a Judah,
which were carried away captive
unto Babylon.
2 And the captain of the guard
took Jeremiah, and said unto him,
The Lord thy God hath pronounced
this evil upon this place.
3 Now the Lord hath brought it,
and done according as he hath said:
because ye have a sinned against
the Lord, and have not obeyed his
voice, therefore this b thing is come
upon you.
4 And now, behold, I loose thee this
day from the chains which were upon
thine hand. If it seem good unto thee
to come with me into Babylon, come;
and I will look well unto thee: but
if it seem ill unto thee to come with
me into Babylon, forbear: behold,
all the land is before thee: whither
it seemeth good and convenient for
thee to go, thither go.
5 Now while he was not yet gone
back, he said, Go back also to a Geda­
liah the son of Ahikam the son of
Shaphan, whom the king of Bab­
ylon hath made governor over the
cities of Judah, and dwell with him
among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee
to go. So the captain of the guard

gave him b victuals and a reward,
and let him go.
6 Then went Jeremiah unto Geda­
liah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah;
and dwelt with him among the
people that were left in the land.
7 ¶ Now when all the captains of
the forces which were in the fields,
even they and their men, heard that
the king of Babylon had made Geda­
liah the son of Ahikam governor
in the land, and had committed
unto him men, and women, and
children, and of the a poor of the
land, of them that were not carried
away captive to Babylon;
8 Then they came to Gedaliah to
Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah, and a Johanan and Jona­
than the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah
the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons
of Ephai the Netophathite, and
Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite,
they and their men.
9 And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam
the son of Shaphan sware unto them
and to their men, saying, Fear not
to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the
land, and serve the king of Babylon,
and it shall be well with you.
10 As for me, behold, I will dwell
at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans,
which will come unto us: but ye,
gather ye wine, and summer fruits,
and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that
ye have taken.
11 Likewise when all the Jews that
were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were
in all the countries, heard that the
king of Babylon had left a remnant
of Judah, and that he had set over
them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam
the son of Shaphan;
12 Even all the Jews returned out
of all places whither they were
driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and
gathered wine and summer fruits
very much.
13 ¶ Moreover Johanan the son of

Kareah, and all the a captains of the
forces that were in the fields, came
to Gedaliah to Mizpah,
14 And said unto him, Dost thou
certainly know that Baalis the king
of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael
the son of Nethaniah to slay thee?
But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam
believed them not.
15 Then Johanan the son of Kareah
spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee,
and I will slay Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah, and no man shall know
it: wherefore should he slay thee,
that all the Jews which are gathered
unto thee should be scattered, and
the remnant in Judah perish?
16 But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam
said unto Johanan the son of Ka­
reah, Thou shalt not do this thing:
for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.
Chapter 41
Ishmael kills Gedaliah and carries the
people of Mizpah captive—They are
rescued by Johanan.
Now it came to pass in the seventh
month, that Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of
the seed royal, and the princes
of the king, even ten men with him,
came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did
eat bread together in Mizpah.
2 Then arose Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah, and the ten men that
were with him, and smote Geda­
liah the son of Ahikam the son of
Shaphan with the sword, and slew
him, whom the king of Babylon
had made governor over the land.
3 Ishmael also slew all the Jews
that were with him, even with Geda­
liah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans
that were found there, and the men
of war.
4 And it came to pass the second
day after he had slain Gedaliah,
and no man knew it,
5 That there came certain from
Shechem, from Shiloh, and from
Samaria, even fourscore men, having
	13	a	 Jer. 43:4.

41	10	a	 Jer. 43:6.

their beards shaven, and their
clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense
in their hand, to bring them to the
house of the Lord.
6 And Ishmael the son of Netha­
niah went forth from Mizpah to
meet them, weeping all along as he
went: and it came to pass, as he met
them, he said unto them, Come to
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.
7 And it was so, when they came
into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew
them, and cast them into the midst
of the pit, he, and the men that were
with him.
8 But ten men were found among
them that said unto Ishmael, Slay
us not: for we have treasures in the
field, of wheat, and of barley, and
of oil, and of honey. So he forbare,
and slew them not among their
brethren.
9 Now the pit wherein Ishmael
had cast all the dead bodies of the
men, whom he had slain because
of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the
king had made for fear of Baasha
king of Israel: and Ishmael the son
of Nethaniah filled it with them that
were slain.
10 Then Ishmael carried away
captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the
king’s a daughters, and all the people
that remained in Mizpah, whom
Nebuzar-adan the captain of the
guard had committed to Gedaliah
the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael
the son of Nethaniah carried them
away captive, and departed to go
over to the Ammonites.
11 ¶ But when Johanan the son of
Kareah, and all the captains of the
forces that were with him, heard of
all the evil that Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah had done,
12 Then they took all the men, and
went to fight with Ishmael the son
of Nethaniah, and found him by
the a great waters that are in Gibeon.
13 Now it came to pass, that when
all the people which were with
	12	a	 or  many pools.

1001

Jeremiah 41:14–42:12

Ishmael saw Johanan the son of
Kareah, and all the captains of the
forces that were with him, then they
were glad.
14 So all the people that Ishmael
had carried away captive from
Mizpah a cast about and returned,
and went unto Johanan the son of
Kareah.
15 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah
escaped from Johanan with eight
men, and went to the Ammonites.
16 Then took Johanan the son of
Kareah, and all the captains of the
forces that were with him, all the
remnant of the people whom he had
recovered from Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that
he had slain Gedaliah the son of
Ahi­kam, even mighty men of war,
and the women, and the children,
and the a eunuchs, whom he had
brought again from Gibeon:
17 And they departed, and dwelt
in the habitation of Chimham,
which is by Beth-lehem, to go to
enter into Egypt,
18 Because of the Chaldeans: for
they were afraid of them, because
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had
slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,
whom the king of Babylon made
governor in the land.
Chapter 42
Jeremiah promises Johanan and the remnant of Judah peace and safety if they
remain in Judah, but the sword, famine, and pestilence if they go to Egypt.
Then all the captains of the forces,
and Johanan the son of Kareah, and
Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and
all the people from the least even
unto the greatest, came near,
2 And said unto Jeremiah the
prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our
supplication be accepted before
thee, and pray for us unto the Lord

(for we are left but a few of many,
as thine eyes do behold us:)
3 That the Lord thy God may shew
us the way wherein we may walk,
and the thing that we may do.
4 Then Jeremiah the prophet said
unto them, I have heard you; behold,
I will a pray unto the Lord your
God according to your words; and it
shall come to pass, that whatsoever
thing the Lord shall answer you, I
will declare it unto you; I will keep
nothing back from you.
5 Then they said to Jeremiah,
The Lord be a true and a faithful
witness between us, if we do not
even according to all things for the
which the Lord thy God shall send
thee to us.
6 Whether it be good, or whether
it be evil, we will obey the a voice
of the Lord our God, to whom we
send thee; that it may be well with
us, when we obey the voice of the
Lord our God.
7 ¶ And it came to pass after ten
days, that the word of the Lord
came unto Jeremiah.
8 Then called he Johanan the son
of Kareah, and all the captains of
the forces which were with him, and
all the people from the least even
to the greatest,
9 And said unto them, Thus saith
the Lord, the God of Israel, unto
whom ye sent me to present your
supplication before him;
10 If ye will still abide in this land,
then will I build you, and not pull
you down, and I will plant you, and
not pluck you up: a for I repent me of
the evil that I have done unto you.
11 Be not afraid of the king of
Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be
not afraid of him, saith the Lord:
for I am with you to save you, and
to deliver you from his hand.

you, that he may have mercy upon
you, and cause you to return to your
own land.
13 ¶ But if ye say, We will not dwell
in this land, neither obey the voice
of the Lord your God,
14 Saying, No; but we will go into
the land of Egypt, where we shall
see no war, nor hear the sound of
the a trumpet, nor have hunger of
bread; and there will we dwell:
15 And now therefore hear the
word of the Lord, ye remnant of
Judah; Thus saith the Lord of hosts,
the God of Israel; If ye wholly set
your a faces to enter into Egypt, and
go to sojourn there;
16 Then it shall come to pass, that
the sword, which ye feared, shall
overtake you there in the land of
Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye
were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there
ye shall die.
17 So shall it be with all the men
that set their faces to go into Egypt
to sojourn there; they shall die by
the sword, by the famine, and by the
pestilence: and none of them shall
remain or escape from the evil that
I will bring upon them.
18 For thus saith the Lord of hosts,
the God of Israel; As mine anger
and my fury hath been poured
forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured
forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an
a 
execration, and an astonishment,
and a curse, and a reproach; and ye
shall see this place no more.
19 ¶ The Lord hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah;
Go ye not into a Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you
this day.
20 For ye a  dissembled in your
hearts, when ye sent me unto the
Lord your God, saying, Pray for
us unto the Lord our God; and according unto all that the Lord our

21 And now I have this day declared
it to you; but ye have not a obeyed
the voice of the Lord your God, nor
any thing for the which he hath sent
me unto you.
22 Now therefore know certainly
that ye shall die by the sword, by
the famine, and by the pestilence,
in the place whither ye desire to go
and to sojourn.
Chapter 43
Johanan carries Jeremiah and the remnant of Judah into Egypt—Jeremiah
prophesies that Babylon will conquer
Egypt.
And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking
unto all the people all the words of
the Lord their God, for which the
Lord their God had sent him to
them, even all these words,
2 Then spake Azariah the son of
Hoshaiah, and a Johanan the son of
Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest
falsely: the Lord our God hath not
sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt
to sojourn there:
3 But a Baruch the son of Neriah
setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to
death, and carry us away captives
into Babylon.
4 So Johanan the son of Kareah,
and all the a captains of the forces,
and all the people, obeyed not the
voice of the Lord, to dwell in the
land of Judah.
5 But Johanan the son of Kareah,
and all the captains of the forces,
took all the remnant of Judah, that
were returned from all nations,
whither they had been driven, to
dwell in the land of Judah;

every person that b Nebuzar-adan

with c Gedaliah the son of Ahikam
the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah
the prophet, and Baruch the son
of Neriah.
7 So they came into the land of

Egypt: for they obeyed not the

even to b Tahpanhes.
8 ¶ Then came the word of the
Lord unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,
9 Take great stones in thine hand,
and hide them in the clay in the
brickkiln, which is at the entry of
Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in
the sight of the men of Judah;
10 And say unto them, Thus saith
the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take
a 
Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his
throne upon these stones that I have
hid; and he shall spread his royal
pavilion over them.
11 And when he cometh, he shall
a 
smite the land of Egypt, and deliver
such as are for death to death;
and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword
to the sword.
12 And I will kindle a fire in the
houses of the a gods of Egypt; and
he shall burn them, and carry them
away b captives: and he shall array
himself with the land of Egypt, as
a shepherd putteth on his garment;
and he shall go forth from thence
in peace.
13 He shall break also the images
of Beth-shemesh, that is in the
land of Egypt; and the houses of
the gods of the Egyptians shall he
burn with fire.

Jeremiah prophesies that the Jews in
Egypt, save a small remnant, will be
destroyed because they worship false
gods.
The word that came to Jeremiah
concerning all the Jews which dwell
in the land of Egypt, which dwell at
a 
Migdol, and at b Tahpanhes, and at
c 
Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,
2 Thus saith the Lord of hosts,
the God of Israel; Ye have seen all
the a evil that I have brought upon
Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day
they are a b desolation, and no man
dwelleth therein,
3 Because of their wickedness
which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went
to a burn incense, and to serve other
b 
gods, whom they knew not, neither
they, ye, nor your fathers.
4 Howbeit I a sent unto you all my
servants the prophets, rising early
and sending them, saying, Oh, do not
this b abominable thing that I hate.
5 But they a hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their
b 
wickedness, to burn no incense
unto other gods.
6 Wherefore my fury and mine
anger was poured forth, and was
kindled in the cities of Judah and in
the streets of Jerusalem; and they are
wasted and desolate, as at this day.
7 Therefore now thus saith the
Lord, the God of hosts, the God of
Israel; Wherefore commit ye this
great a evil against your souls, to
cut off from you man and woman,
child and suckling, out of Judah, to
leave you none to remain;

8 In that ye a provoke me unto
wrath with the b  works of your
hands, burning incense unto other
gods in the land of Egypt, whither
ye be gone to dwell, that ye might
c 
cut yourselves off, and that ye
might be a curse and a reproach
among all the nations of the earth?
9 Have ye forgotten the wickedness
of your fathers, and the wickedness
of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their a wives, and your own
wickedness, and the wickedness of
your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in
the streets of Jerusalem?
10 They are not a humbled even
unto this day, neither have they
b 
feared, nor walked in my law, nor
in my statutes, that I set before you
and before your fathers.
11 ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord
of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold,
I will set my a face against you for
evil, and to cut off all Judah.
12 And I will take the remnant
of Judah, that have set their a faces
to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be
b 
consumed, and fall in the land of
Egypt; they shall even be consumed
by the sword and by the famine:
they shall die, from the least even
unto the greatest, by the sword and
by the famine: and they shall be an

execration, and an astonishment,
and a curse, and a reproach.
13 For I will a punish them that
dwell in the land of Egypt, as I
have punished Jerusalem, by the
sword, by the famine, and by the
pestilence:
14 So that none of the remnant
of Judah, which are gone into the
land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall
escape or remain, that they should
return into the land of Judah, to the
which they have a desire to return

15 ¶ Then all the men which knew
that their wives had burned incense
unto other gods, and all the women
that stood by, a great multitude,
even all the people that dwelt in
the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,
16 As for the word that thou hast
spoken unto us in the name of the
Lord, we will not a hearken unto
thee.
17 But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our
a 
own mouth, to burn incense unto
b 
the queen of heaven, and to pour
out drink offerings unto her, as we
have done, we, and our fathers, our
kings, and our princes, in the cities
of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of c victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.
18 But since we left off to burn
incense to the queen of heaven, and
to pour out drink offerings unto
her, we have a wanted all things, and
have been consumed by the sword
and by the famine.
19 And when we burned incense
to the queen of heaven, and poured
out drink offerings unto her, did
we make her cakes to worship her,
and pour out drink offerings unto
her, without our men?
20 ¶ Then Jeremiah said unto all
the people, to the men, and to the
women, and to all the people which
had given him that answer, saying,
21 The incense that ye burned in
the cities of Judah, and in the streets
of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers,
your kings, and your princes, and
the people of the land, did not the
Lord a remember them, and came
it not into his mind?

doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed;
therefore is your land a a desolation, and an astonishment, and a
curse, without an inhabitant, as at
this day.
23 Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned
against the Lord, and have not
a 
obeyed the voice of the Lord, nor
walked in his law, nor in his statutes,
nor in his testimonies; therefore this
b 
evil is happened unto you, as at
this day.
24 Moreover Jeremiah said unto all
the people, and to all the women,
Hear the word of the Lord, all Judah that are in the land of a Egypt:
25 Thus saith the Lord of hosts,
the God of Israel, saying; Ye and
your wives have both spoken with
your mouths, and fulfilled with
your hand, saying, We will surely
perform our vows that we have
vowed, to burn incense to the queen
of heaven, and to pour out drink
offerings unto her: ye will surely
accomplish your vows, and surely
perform your vows.
26 Therefore hear ye the word of
the Lord, all Judah that dwell in
the land of Egypt; Behold, I have
a 
sworn by my great b name, saith the
Lord, that my name shall no more
be named in the mouth of any man
of Judah in all the land of Egypt,
saying, The Lord God liveth.
27 Behold, I will a watch over them
for evil, and not for good: and all
the men of Judah that are in the
land of Egypt shall be consumed by
the sword and by the famine, until
there be an end of them.

dah, that are gone into the land of

29 ¶ And this shall be a sign unto
you, saith the Lord, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may
know that my words shall surely
stand against you for evil:
30 Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I
will give a Pharaoh-hophra king of
Egypt into the hand of his enemies,
and into the hand of them that seek
his life; as I gave b Zedekiah king of
Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy,
and that sought his life.
Chapter 45
Jeremiah promises Baruch that his life
will be preserved.
The word that Jeremiah the prophet
spake unto a Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these
words in a book at the mouth of Jere­
miah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah,
saying,
2 Thus saith the Lord, the God of
Israel, unto thee, O Baruch;
3 Thou didst say, Woe is me now!
for the Lord hath added grief to
my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing,
and I find no a rest.
4 ¶ Thus shalt thou say unto him,
The Lord saith thus; Behold, that
which I have built will I a break
down, and that which I have planted
I will b pluck up, even c this whole
land.
5 And a seekest thou great things
for thyself? seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh,
saith the Lord: but thy b life will
I give unto thee for a prey in all
places whither thou goest.

Chapter 46
Jeremiah prophesies the conquest of
Egypt by Babylon—Jacob will be saved
and will return to his own land.
The word of the Lord which came
to Jeremiah the prophet against the
a 
Gentiles;
2 Against Egypt, against the army
of a Pharaoh-necho king of Egypt,
which was by the river Euphrates
in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in
the fourth year of Jehoiakim the
son of Josiah king of Judah.
3 Order ye the buckler and shield,
and draw near to battle.
4 Harness the horses; and get up,
ye horsemen, and stand forth with
your helmets; furbish the spears, and
put on the a brigandines.
5 Wherefore have I seen them
dismayed and a turned away back?
and their mighty ones are beaten
down, and are fled apace, and look
not back: for fear was round about,
saith the Lord.
6 Let not the swift flee away, nor
the mighty man escape; they shall
stumble, and fall toward the north
by the river Euphrates.
7 Who is this that cometh up as a
a 
flood, whose waters are moved as
the rivers?
8 Egypt riseth up like a a flood, and
his waters are moved like the rivers;
and he saith, I will go up, and will
cover the earth; I will destroy the
city and the inhabitants thereof.
9 Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye
chariots; and let the mighty men
come forth; the Ethiopians and the
Libyans, that handle the shield;
and the a Lydians, that handle and
bend the bow.
10 For this is the a day of the Lord
God of hosts, a day of vengeance,

that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be b satiate and
made drunk with their blood: for
the Lord God of hosts hath a c sacrifice in the north country by the
river Euphrates.
11 Go up into Gilead, and take
a 
balm, O virgin, the daughter of
Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many
medicines; for thou shalt not be
cured.
12 The nations have heard of thy
a 
shame, and thy cry hath filled
the land: for the mighty man hath
stumbled against the mighty, and
they are fallen both together.
13 ¶ The word that the Lord spake
to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should
come and smite the land of a Egypt.
14 Declare ye in Egypt, and publish
in a Migdol, and publish in Noph and
in b Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast,
and prepare thee; for the sword shall
devour round about thee.
15 Why are thy a valiant men swept
away ? they stood not, because the
Lord did drive them.
16 He made many to fall, yea, one
fell upon another: and they said,
Arise, and let us go again to our
own people, and to the land of our
nativity, from the oppressing sword.
17 They did cry there, Pharaoh
king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath
passed the time appointed.
18 As I live, saith the King, whose
name is the Lord of hosts, Surely
as Tabor is among the mountains,
and as Carmel by the sea, so shall
he come.
19 O thou daughter dwelling in
Egypt, furnish thyself to go into
a 
captivity: for Noph shall be waste
and desolate without an inhabitant.

but destruction cometh; it cometh

21 Also her hired men are in the
midst of her like fatted bullocks;
for they also are turned back, and
are fled away together: they did
not stand, because the day of their
calamity was come upon them, and
the time of their visitation.
22 The voice thereof shall go like
a serpent; for they shall march with
an army, and come against her with
axes, as hewers of wood.
23 They shall cut down her forest,
saith the Lord, though it cannot be
searched; because they are more
than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable.
24 The daughter of Egypt shall
be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people
of the north.
25 The a Lord of hosts, the God of
Israel, saith; Behold, I will punish
b 
the multitude of c No, and d Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their e gods,
and their kings; even Pharaoh, and
all them that trust in him:
26 And I will deliver them into
the hand of those that seek their
lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and
into the hand of his servants: and
afterward it shall be a inhabited, as
in the days of old, saith the Lord.
27 ¶ But fear not thou, O my servant a Jacob, and be not dismayed,
O Israel: for, behold, I will save thee
from afar off, and thy seed from the
land of their captivity; and Jacob
shall return, and be in rest and at
ease, and none shall make him afraid.
28 Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the Lord: for I am with
thee; for I will make a full end
of all the nations whither I have
driven thee: but I will not make a
full end of thee, but correct thee in
measure; yet will I not leave thee
wholly unpunished.

Jeremiah foretells desolation and destruction upon the Philistines.
The word of the Lord that came to
Jeremiah the prophet against the
a 
Philistines, before that Pharaoh
smote Gaza.
2 Thus saith the Lord; Behold,
a 
waters rise up out of the north,
and shall be an overflowing flood,
and shall overflow the land, and all
that is therein; the city, and them
that dwell therein: then the men
shall cry, and all the inhabitants
of the land shall howl.
3 At the noise of the stamping of
the hoofs of his strong horses, at the
rushing of his chariots, and at the
rumbling of his wheels, the fathers
shall not look back to their children
for feebleness of hands;
4 Because of the day that cometh
to spoil all the Philistines, and to
cut off from a Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the
Lord will spoil the Philistines, the
remnant of the country of Caphtor.
5 Baldness is come upon Gaza;
Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant of their valley: how long wilt
thou cut thyself?
6 O thou sword of the Lord, how
long will it be ere thou be quiet? put
up thyself into thy scabbard, rest,
and be still.
7 How can it be quiet, seeing the
Lord hath given it a charge against
Ashkelon, and against the sea shore?
there hath he appointed it.
Chapter 48
Judgment and destruction will come upon
the Moabites for their contempt of God.
Against a Moab thus saith the Lord
of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe unto

2 There shall be no more praise of
Moab: in Heshbon they have devised
evil against it; come, and let us cut
it off from being a nation. Also thou
shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the
sword shall pursue thee.
3 A voice of crying shall be from
a 
Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.
4 a Moab is destroyed; her little
ones have caused a cry to be heard.
5 For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the
going down of Horonaim the enemies
have heard a cry of destruction.
6 Flee, save your lives, and be like
the a heath in the wilderness.
7 ¶ For because thou hast trusted
in thy a works and in thy treasures,
thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into b captivity
with his priests and his princes together.
8 And the spoiler shall come upon
every city, and no city shall escape:
the valley also shall perish, and
the plain shall be destroyed, as the
Lord hath spoken.
9 Give wings unto Moab, that it
may flee and get away: for the cities
thereof shall be desolate, without
any to dwell therein.
10 a Cursed be he that doeth the
work of the Lord deceitfully, and
cursed be he that keepeth back his
sword from blood.
11 ¶ Moab hath been at ease from
his youth, and he hath a settled on
his b lees, and hath not been emptied
from vessel to vessel, neither hath
he gone into captivity: therefore
his taste remained in him, and his
scent is not changed.
12 Therefore, behold, the days
come, saith the Lord, that I will
send unto him a wanderers, that
shall cause him to wander, and shall
empty his vessels, and break their

28 O ye that dwell in Moab, leave
the cities, and dwell in the rock, and
be like the dove that maketh her
nest in the sides of the hole’s mouth.
29 We have heard the a pride of
Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his
loftiness, and his arrogancy, and
his pride, and the haughtiness of
his heart.
30 I know his wrath, saith the
Lord; but it shall not be so; his lies
shall not so effect it.
31 Therefore will I howl for Moab,
and I will cry out for all Moab; mine
heart shall mourn for the men of
Kir-heres.
32 O vine of Sibmah, I will weep
for thee with the weeping of Jazer:
thy a plants are gone over the sea,
they reach even to the sea of Jazer:
the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.
33 And joy and a gladness is taken
from the plentiful field, and from
the land of Moab; and I have caused
wine to fail from the winepresses:
none shall tread with shouting; their
b 
shouting shall be no shouting.
34 From the cry of a Heshbon even
unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz,
have they uttered their voice, from
Zoar even unto Horonaim, as an

desolate.

in Moab, saith the Lord, him that
offereth in the high places, and him
that burneth incense to his gods.
36 Therefore mine a heart shall
sound for Moab like pipes, and

broken Moab like a a vessel wherein
is no pleasure, saith the Lord.
39 They shall howl, saying, How
is it broken down! how hath Moab
turned the back with shame! so shall
Moab be a derision and a dismaying
to all them about him.
40 For thus saith the Lord; Behold,
he shall fly as an a eagle, and shall
spread his wings over Moab.
41 a Kerioth is taken, and the strong
holds are b surprised, and the mighty
men’s hearts in Moab at that day
shall be as the heart of a woman in
her pangs.
42 And Moab shall be destroyed
from being a people, because he hath
a 
magnified himself against the Lord.
43 Fear, and the pit, and the snare,
shall be upon thee, O inhabitant of
Moab, saith the Lord.
44 He that fleeth from the fear
shall fall into the pit; and he that
getteth up out of the pit shall be
taken in the snare: for I will bring
upon it, even upon Moab, the year
of their visitation, saith the Lord.
45 They that fled stood under the
shadow of Heshbon because of the
force: but a fire shall come forth out
of a Heshbon, and a flame from the
midst of Sihon, and shall devour the
corner of b Moab, and the crown of
the head of the tumultuous ones.
46 Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the
people of Chemosh perisheth: for
thy sons are taken captives, and thy
daughters captives.
47 ¶ Yet will I a bring again the
captivity of b Moab in the latter
days, saith the Lord. Thus far is

Judgment and destruction will come
upon the people of Ammon, Edom, Kedar, Hazor, and Elam.
Concerning the Ammonites, thus
saith the Lord; Hath Israel no sons?
hath he no heir? why then doth their
king inherit Gad, and his people
dwell in his cities?
2 Therefore, behold, the days come,
saith the Lord, that I will cause an
alarm of war to be heard in a Rabbah
of the b Ammonites; and it shall be
a desolate heap, and her c daughters
shall be burned with fire: then shall
Israel be heir unto them that were
his heirs, saith the Lord.
3 Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is
spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the
hedges; for their king shall go into
a 
captivity, and his priests and his
princes together.
4 Wherefore gloriest thou in the

come unto me?

thee, saith the Lord God of hosts,
from all those that be about thee;
and ye shall be driven out every man
right forth; and none shall gather
up him that wandereth.
6 And afterward I will a  bring
again the captivity of the children
of Ammon, saith the Lord.

18 As in the overthrow of a Sodom
and Gomorrah and the neighbour

man shall abide there, neither shall
a son of man dwell in it.
19 Behold, he shall come up like
a a lion from the swelling of Jordan
against the habitation of the strong:
but I will suddenly make him run
away from her: and who is a chosen
man, that I may appoint over her?
for who is like me? and who will
appoint me the time? and who
is that shepherd that will stand
before me?
20 Therefore hear the counsel of
the Lord, that he hath taken against
Edom; and his purposes, that he
hath purposed against the inhabi­
tants of Teman: Surely the least
of the flock shall draw them out:
surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.
21 The earth is a moved at the noise
of their fall, at the cry the noise
thereof was heard in the Red sea.

28 ¶ Concerning a Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor,
which Nebuchadrezzar king of
Babylon shall smite, thus saith the
Lord; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and
spoil the men of the east.
29 Their a tents and their flocks
shall they take away: they shall take
to themselves their b curtains, and
all their vessels, and their camels;
and they shall cry unto them, c Fear
is on every side.
30 ¶ Flee, get you far off, dwell
deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor,
saith the Lord; for a Nebuchadrezzar
king of Babylon hath taken counsel
against you, and hath conceived a
purpose against you.
31 Arise, get you up unto the
wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the Lord, which
have neither gates nor bars, which
dwell alone.

booty, and the multitude of their
cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into
all winds them that are in the utmost
corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith

I have consumed them:
38 And I will set my throne in
Elam, and will destroy from thence
the king and the princes, saith the
Lord.
39 ¶ But it shall come to pass in
the latter days, that I will bring
again the captivity of Elam, saith
the Lord.
Chapter 50
Babylon will be destroyed and never rise
again—The scattered people of Israel
will be brought again into the lands of
their inheritance.
The a word that the Lord spake
against Babylon and against the
land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah
the prophet.
2 Declare ye among the nations,
and publish, and set up a standard;
publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, a Bel is confounded,
Merodach is broken in pieces; her
idols are confounded, her images
are broken in pieces.
3 For out of the a  north there
cometh up a nation against her,
which shall make her land desolate,
and none shall b dwell therein: they
shall remove, they shall depart, both
man and beast.
4 ¶ In those days, and in that
time, saith the Lord, the children
of Israel shall a come, they and the
children of Judah b together, going
and c weeping: they shall go, and
seek the Lord their God.
5 They shall ask the way to Zion

with their faces thitherward, saying,
Come, and let us join ourselves to
the Lord in a a perpetual b covenant
that shall not be forgotten.
6 My people hath been lost sheep:
their a shepherds have caused them
to go astray, they have turned them
away on the mountains: they have
gone from mountain to hill, they
have forgotten their restingplace.
7 All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries
said, We a offend not, because they
have sinned against the Lord, the
habitation of justice, even the Lord,
the hope of their fathers.
8 a Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land
of the b Chaldeans, and be as the he
goats before the flocks.
9 ¶ For, lo, I will raise and cause
to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the
a 
north country: and they shall set
themselves in array against her;
from thence she shall be taken: their
b 
arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return c in vain.
10 And Chaldea shall be a spoil:
all that spoil her shall be satisfied,
saith the Lord.
11 Because ye were glad, because
ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine
heritage, because ye are grown fat
as the heifer at grass, and bellow
as bulls;
12 Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be
ashamed: behold, the a hindermost
of the nations shall be a wilderness,
a dry land, and a desert.
13 Because of the wrath of the Lord
it shall not be inhabited, but it shall
be wholly desolate: every one that
goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.

Babylon round about: all ye that

the Lord.
15 Shout against her round about:
she hath a given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are
thrown down: for it is the vengeance
of the Lord: take vengeance upon
her; as she hath done, do unto her.
16 Cut off the sower from Babylon,
and him that handleth the sickle in
the time of harvest: for fear of the
oppressing sword they shall turn
every one to his a people, and they
shall flee every one to his own b land.
17 ¶ Israel is a scattered sheep; the
lions have driven him away: first the
king of Assyria hath devoured him;
and last this Nebuchadrezzar king
of Babylon hath a broken his bones.
18 Therefore thus saith the Lord
of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold,
I will punish the king of Babylon
and his land, as I have punished
the king of Assyria.
19 And I will a bring Israel again
to his habitation, and he shall feed
on Carmel and Bashan, and his
soul shall be satisfied upon mount
Ephraim and Gilead.
20 In those days, and in that time,
saith the Lord, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there
shall be none; and the sins of Judah,
and they shall not be found: for I
will a pardon them whom I reserve.
21 ¶ Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against
the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and
utterly destroy after them, saith the
Lord, and do according to all that
I have commanded thee.
22 A sound of battle is in the land,
and of great destruction.
23 How is the hammer of the whole
earth cut asunder and broken! how
is Babylon become a desolation
among the nations!

thou hast striven against the Lord.
25 The Lord hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the
weapons of his indignation: for this
is the work of the Lord God of hosts
in the land of the Chaldeans.
26 Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses:
cast her up as heaps, and destroy her
utterly: let nothing of her be left.
27 Slay all her bullocks; let them
go down to the slaughter: woe unto
them! for their day is come, the

29 Call together the archers against
Babylon: all ye that bend the bow,
camp against it round about; let
none thereof escape: recompense
her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do
unto her: for she hath been proud
against the Lord, against the Holy
One of Israel.
30 Therefore shall her young men
fall in the streets, and all her men
of war shall be cut off in that day,
saith the Lord.
31 Behold, I am against thee, O thou
most proud, saith the Lord God of
hosts: for thy day is come, the time
that I will visit thee.
32 And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise
him up: and I will kindle a fire in
his cities, and it shall devour all
round about him.
33 ¶ Thus saith the Lord of hosts;
The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused
to let them go.

may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
35 ¶ A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the Lord, and upon the
inhabitants of Babylon, and upon
her princes, and upon her wise men.
36 A sword is upon the liars; and
they shall dote: a sword is upon
her mighty men; and they shall be
dismayed.
37 A sword is upon their horses,
and upon their chariots, and upon
all the a mingled people that are in
the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her
b 
treasures; and they shall be robbed.
38 A a drought is upon her waters;
and they shall be b dried up: for it
is the land of graven images, and
they are mad upon their idols.
39 Therefore the wild beasts of the
desert with the wild beasts of
the islands shall dwell there, and the
a 
owls shall dwell therein: and it
shall be no more inhabited for ever;
neither shall it be dwelt in from
generation to generation.
40 As God overthrew a Sodom and
Gomorrah and the neighbour cities
thereof, saith the Lord; so shall no
man abide there, neither shall any
son of man dwell therein.
41 Behold, a people shall come
from the a north, and a great nation,
and many kings shall be raised up
from the b coasts of the earth.
42 They shall hold the bow and
the lance: they are a cruel, and will
not shew mercy: their voice shall
roar like the sea, and they shall ride
upon horses, every one put in array,
like a man to the battle, against
thee, O daughter of Babylon.
43 The king of Babylon hath heard
the report of them, and his hands
waxed feeble: anguish took hold
of him, and pangs as of a woman
in travail.

will make them suddenly run away
from her: and who is a chosen man,
that I may appoint over her? for who
is like me? and who will appoint me
the time? and who is that a shepherd
that will stand before me?
45 Therefore hear ye the counsel
of the Lord, that he hath taken
against Babylon; and his purposes,
that he hath purposed against the
land of the Chaldeans: Surely the
least of the flock shall draw them
out: surely he shall make their habi­
tation desolate with them.
46 At the noise of the taking of
Babylon the earth is a moved, and
the cry is heard among the nations.

Judgment, destruction, and desolation
will come upon Babylon for her sins—
Israel is commanded, Flee from Bab­

Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will
raise up against a  Babylon, and
against them that dwell in the midst

are thrust through in her streets.

this is the time of the Lord’s vengeance; he will render unto her a
recompence.
7 Babylon hath been a golden cup
in the Lord’s hand, that made all
the earth drunken: the nations have
drunken of her wine; therefore the
nations are mad.
8 Babylon is suddenly fallen and
destroyed: a howl for her; take b balm
for her pain, if so be she may be
healed.
9 We would have healed Babylon,
but she is not healed: forsake her,
and let us go every one into his

reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted
up even to the skies.

for his device is against Babylon,
to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the Lord, the vengeance
of his temple.

walls of Babylon, make the watch
strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the Lord
hath both devised and done that

17 Every man is brutish by his

26 And they shall not take of thee

to a cut it off, that none shall remain
in it, neither man nor beast, but

are the words of Jeremiah.
Chapter 52
Jerusalem is besieged and taken by the
Chaldeans—Many people and the vessels of the house of the Lord are carried
into Babylon.
a 
Zedekiah was one and twenty years
old when he began to reign, and he
reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
And his mother’s name was Hamutal
the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
2 And he did that which was evil in
the eyes of the Lord, according to
all that Jehoiakim had done.
3 For through the anger of the
Lord it came to pass in Jerusalem
and Judah, till he had cast them out
from his presence, that a Zedekiah
rebelled against the king of Babylon.
4 ¶ And it came to pass in the
a 
ninth year of his reign, in the
tenth month, in the tenth day of
the month, that Nebuchadrezzar
king of Babylon came, he and all
his army, against Jerusalem, and
pitched against it, and built b forts
against it round about.
5 So the city was besieged unto
the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
6 And in the fourth month, in the
ninth day of the month, the a famine
was sore in the city, so that there
was no b bread for the people of
the land.
7 Then the a city was broken up,
and all the men of war fled, and
went forth out of the city by night
by the way of the gate between the
two walls, which was by the king’s
garden; (now the Chaldeans were

by the city round about:) and they
went by the way of the plain.
8 ¶ But the army of the Chaldeans
a 
pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered
from him.
9 Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath;
where he gave judgment upon him.
10 And the king of Babylon slew
the a sons of Zedekiah before his
eyes: he b slew also all the princes
of Judah in Riblah.
11 Then he put out the a eyes of
Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon
bound him in chains, and b carried
him to c Babylon, and put him in
prison till the day of his death.

the tenth day of the month, which
was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came
Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard,
which served the king of Babylon,
into Jerusalem,
13 And a burned the house of the
Lord, and the king’s house; and all
the houses of Jerusalem, and all the
houses of the great men, b burned
he with fire:
14 And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain
of the guard, brake down all the
a 
walls of Jerusalem round about.
15 Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard a carried away
captive certain of the poor of the
people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and
those that b fell away, that fell to the
king of Babylon, and the rest of
the multitude.

16 But Nebuzar-adan the captain
of the guard left certain of the
poor of the land for vinedressers
and for husbandmen.
17 Also the a pillars of brass that
were in the house of the Lord, and
the bases, and the brasen b sea that
was in the house of the Lord, the
Chaldeans brake, and carried all
the brass of them to Babylon.
18 The a caldrons also, and the
shovels, and the b snuffers, and the
bowls, and the spoons, and all the
vessels of brass wherewith they
ministered, took they away.
19 And the basins, and the firepans,
and the bowls, and the caldrons, and
the candlesticks, and the spoons, and
the cups; that which was of gold in
gold, and that which was of silver
in silver, took the captain of the
guard away.
20 The two pillars, one a sea, and
b 
twelve brasen c bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon
had made in the house of the Lord:
the brass of all these vessels was
without weight.
21 And concerning the pillars, the
height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a a fillet of twelve b cubits did
compass it; and the thickness thereof
was four fingers: it was hollow.
22 And a a chapiter of brass was
upon it; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits, with network
and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all of brass. The
second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these.
23 And there were a ninety and six
pomegranates on a side; and all the
pomegranates upon the network
were an hundred round about.
24 ¶ And the captain of the guard
took Seraiah the chief priest, and
Zephaniah the second priest, and
the three keepers of the door:

25 He took also out of the city an
eunuch, which had the charge of
the men of war; and seven b men
of them that were near the king’s
person, which were found in the
city; and the principal scribe of the
host, who mustered the people of
the land; and threescore men of the
people of the land, that were found
in the midst of the city.
26 So Nebuzar-adan the captain of
the guard took them, and brought
them to the king of Babylon to
Riblah.
27 And the king of Babylon smote
them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus
Judah was carried away a captive
out of his own land.
28 This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive:
in the seventh year three thousand
Jews and three and twenty:
29 In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive
from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty
and two persons:
30 In the three and twentieth year
of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzar-adan
the captain of the guard carried
away a captive of the Jews seven
hundred forty and five persons: all
the persons were four thousand and
six hundred.
31 ¶ And it came to pass in the
seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah,
in the twelfth month, in the five
and twentieth day of the month,
that Evil-merodach king of Babylon
in the first year of his reign lifted
up the head of a Jehoiachin king of
Judah, and brought him forth out
of prison,

The

Lamentations
of Jeremiah
Chapter 1
Jeremiah laments the miserable condi­
tion of Jerusalem—Jerusalem herself
complains of her deep sorrow.

H

ow doth the city sit solitary,
that was full of people! how is
she become as a a widow! she
that was great among the nations,
and b princess among the provinces,
how is she become tributary!
2 a She weepeth sore in the night,
and her tears are on her cheeks:
among all her b lovers she hath none
to c comfort her: all her friends have
dealt treacherously with her, they
are become her enemies.
3 Judah is gone into a captivity
because of affliction, and because
of great servitude: she dwelleth
among the heathen, she findeth no
b 
rest: all her persecutors overtook
her between the straits.
4 The ways of Zion do a mourn,
because none come to the b solemn
feasts: all her gates are desolate:

her priests sigh, her virgins are
afflicted, and she is in bitterness.
5 Her adversaries are the chief, her
enemies prosper; for the Lord hath
a 
afflicted her for the multitude of
her b transgressions: her children
are gone into captivity before the
enemy.
6 And from the daughter of Zion
all her a beauty is departed: her
princes are become like harts that
find no pasture, and they are gone
without strength before the pursuer.
7 Jerusalem remembered in the
days of her affliction and of her
miseries all her pleasant things that
she had in the days of old, when
her people fell into the hand of the
enemy, and none did help her: the
adversaries saw her, and did a mock
at her sabbaths.
8  a Jerusalem hath grievously
sinned; therefore she is b removed:
all that honoured her despise her,
because they have seen her c nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth
backward.

Lamentations 1:9–2:2

9 Her a filthiness is in her skirts;
she remembereth not her last b end;
therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O Lord,
behold my affliction: for the enemy
hath magnified himself.
10 The adversary hath spread
out his hand upon all her pleasant
things: for she hath seen that the
heathen entered into her a sanctuary, whom thou didst command
that they should not enter into thy
b 
congregation.
11 All her people sigh, they seek
a 
bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the
soul: see, O Lord, and consider; for
I am become vile.
12 ¶ Is it nothing to you, all ye that
pass by ? behold, and see if there be
any sorrow like unto my a sorrow,
which is done unto me, wherewith
the Lord hath afflicted me in the
day of his fierce b anger.
13 From above hath he sent fire
into my bones, and it prevaileth
against them: he hath spread a a net
for my feet, he hath turned me back:
he hath made me desolate and faint
all the day.
14 The yoke of my transgressions
is bound by his hand: they are
wreathed, and come up upon my
neck: he hath made my strength
to fall, the Lord hath delivered me
into their hands, from whom I am not
able to rise up.
15 The Lord hath trodden under
foot all my mighty a men in the midst
of me: he hath called an assembly
against me to crush my young men:
the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the
daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.
16 For these things I weep; mine
eye, mine eye runneth down with
water, because the comforter that
should relieve my soul is far from
me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.

17 a Zion spreadeth forth her hands,
and there is none to comfort her: the
Lord hath commanded concerning
Jacob, that his adversaries should be
round about him: Jerusalem is as a
menstruous woman among them.
18 ¶ The Lord is righteous; for I
have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people,
and behold my sorrow: my virgins
and my young men are gone into
captivity.
19 I called for my lovers, but they
deceived me: my priests and mine
elders gave up the ghost in the city,
while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.
20 Behold, O Lord; for I am in
distress: my a bowels are troubled;
mine heart is turned within me; for
I have grievously b rebelled: abroad
the c sword bereaveth, at home there
is as death.
21 They have heard that I sigh: there
is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they
are glad that thou hast done it: thou
wilt bring the day that thou hast
called, and they shall be like unto me.
22 Let all their wickedness come
before thee; and do unto them, as
thou hast done unto me for all my
transgressions: for my sighs are
many, and my heart is faint.
Chapter 2
Misery, sorrow, and desolation prevail
in Jerusalem.
How hath the Lord covered the
daughter of Zion with a cloud in his
anger, and cast down from heaven
unto the earth the beauty of Israel,
and remembered not his a footstool
in the day of his anger!
2 The Lord hath swallowed up all
the habitations of Jacob, and hath
not a pitied: he hath thrown down
in his wrath the strong holds of the

daughter of Judah; he hath brought
them down to the ground: he hath
polluted the kingdom and the
princes thereof.
3 He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath
a 
drawn back his right hand from
before the enemy, and he b burned
against Jacob like a flaming fire,
which devoureth round about.
4 He hath bent his bow like an
a 
enemy: he stood with his right
hand as an adversary, and slew all
that were pleasant to the eye in the
tabernacle of the daughter of Zion:
he poured out his fury like fire.
5 The Lord was as an enemy: he
hath swallowed up Israel, he hath
swallowed up all her palaces: he
hath destroyed his strong holds, and
hath increased in the daughter of
Judah a mourning and lamentation.
6 And he hath violently taken away
his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden: he hath destroyed his places
of the assembly: the Lord hath
caused the solemn feasts and a sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and
hath despised in the indignation of
his anger the king and the priest.
7 The Lord hath cast off his altar,
he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he
hath given up into the hand of the
enemy the a walls of her palaces;
they have made a noise in the house
of the Lord, as in the day of a solemn feast.
8 The Lord hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of
Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he
hath not withdrawn his hand from
destroying: therefore he made the
rampart and the wall to a lament;
they languished together.
9 Her a gates are sunk into the
ground; he hath destroyed and

the law is no more; her c prophets
also find no d vision from the Lord.
10 The elders of the daughter of
Zion sit upon the a ground, and keep
b 
silence: they have cast up dust
upon their heads; they have girded
themselves with c sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their
heads to the ground.
11 Mine eyes do fail with a tears,
my b bowels are troubled, my liver
is poured upon the earth, for the
c 
destruction of the daughter of my
people; because the children and
the sucklings swoon in the streets
of the city.
12 They say to their mothers,
Where is corn and wine? when they
swooned as the wounded in the
streets of the city, when their soul
was poured out into their mothers’
bosom.
13 What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I
liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee,
that I may comfort thee, O a virgin
daughter of Zion? for thy breach
is great like the sea: who can heal
thee?
14 Thy a prophets have seen b vain
and foolish things for thee: and
they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity;
but have seen for thee false burdens
and causes of banishment.

hands at thee; they hiss and wag
their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that
men call The c perfection of d beauty,

and gnash the teeth: they say, We
have swallowed her up: certainly
this is the day that we looked for;
we have found, we have seen it.
17 The Lord hath done that which
he had a devised; he hath fulfilled
his word that he had commanded
in the days of old: he hath thrown
down, and hath not pitied: and he
hath caused thine enemy to rejoice
over thee, he hath set up the horn
of thine adversaries.
18 Their heart cried unto the Lord,
O wall of the daughter of Zion, let
tears run down like a river day and
night: give thyself no rest; let not
the apple of thine eye cease.
19 Arise, cry out in the night: in
the beginning of the watches pour
out thine heart like water before
the face of the Lord: lift up thy
hands toward him for the life of
thy young children, that faint for
hunger in the top of every street.
20 ¶ Behold, O Lord, and consider
to whom thou hast done this. Shall
the women a eat their fruit, and
children of a span long? shall the
priest and the prophet be slain in
the sanctuary of the Lord?
21 The young and the old lie on
the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen
by the sword; thou hast a slain them
in the day of thine anger; thou hast
killed, and not pitied.
22 Thou hast called as in a solemn
day my terrors round about, so that
in the day of the Lord’s anger none
escaped nor remained: those that I
have swaddled and brought up hath
mine enemy consumed.
Chapter 3
Jeremiah, speaking for Judah, laments
the calamity but trusts in the Lord and
prays for deliverance.

4 My flesh and my skin hath he
made old; he hath broken my bones.
5 He hath builded against me, and
compassed me with gall and travail.
6 He hath set me in dark places,
as they that be dead of old.
7 He hath a hedged me about, that
I cannot get out: he hath made my
chain heavy.
8 Also when I cry and shout, he
shutteth out my prayer.
9 He hath inclosed my ways with
hewn stone, he hath made my paths
crooked.
10 He was unto me as a bear lying
in wait, and as a lion in secret places.
11 He hath turned aside my ways,
and pulled me in pieces: he hath
made me desolate.
12 He hath bent his bow, and set
me as a mark for the arrow.
13 He hath caused the arrows of
his quiver to enter into my reins.
14 I was a a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.
15 He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken
with wormwood.
16 He hath also broken my teeth
with gravel stones, he hath covered
me with ashes.
17 And thou hast removed my
soul far off from peace: I forgat
prosperity.
18 And I said, My strength and my
hope is perished from the Lord:
19 Remembering mine affliction
and my misery, the wormwood and
the gall.
20 My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.
21 This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.

we are not consumed, because his
compassions fail not.

my soul; therefore will I hope in
him.
25 The Lord is a good unto them
that b wait for him, to the soul that
c 
seeketh him.
26 It is good that a man should
both a hope and quietly wait for the
salvation of the Lord.
27 It is good for a man that he
a 
bear the yoke in his b youth.
28 He sitteth alone and keepeth
silence, because he hath borne it
upon him.
29 He putteth his mouth in the
dust; if so be there may be hope.
30 He giveth his a cheek to him that
smiteth him: he is filled full with
b 
reproach.
31 For the Lord will not cast off
for ever:
32 But though he cause grief, yet
will he have a compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.
33 For he doth not a afflict willingly
nor grieve the children of men.
34 To crush under his feet all the
prisoners of the earth,
35 To turn aside the right of a man
before the face of the most High,
36 To subvert a man in his cause,
the Lord approveth not.
37 ¶ Who is he that saith, and it
cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?
38 Out of the mouth of the most
High proceedeth not evil and good?
39 Wherefore doth a living man
complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?

and turn again to the Lord.
41 Let us a lift up our heart with

Lord, out of the low dungeon.

not thine ear at my breathing, at
my cry.
57 Thou a drewest near in the day
that I called upon thee: thou saidst,
Fear not.

causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.

Lamentations 3:62–4:17

O Lord, and all their imaginations
against me;
62 The lips of those that rose up
against me, and their a device against
me all the day.
63 Behold their sitting down, and
their rising up; I am their musick.
64 ¶ Render unto them a recompence, O Lord, according to the
work of their hands.
65 Give them sorrow of heart, thy
curse unto them.
66 Persecute and destroy them
in anger from under the heavens
of the Lord.
Chapter 4
The condition of Zion is pitiful because
of sin and iniquity.
How is the gold become dim! how
is the most fine gold changed! the
stones of the sanctuary are poured
out in the top of every street.
2 The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they
esteemed as earthen pitchers, the
work of the hands of the potter!
3 Even the sea monsters draw out
the breast, they give suck to their
young ones: the daughter of my
people is become a cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.
4 The tongue of the sucking child
cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for
thirst: the young children ask a bread,
and no man breaketh it unto them.
5 They that did feed delicately are
desolate in the streets: they that
were brought up in scarlet embrace
dunghills.
6 For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people
is greater than the punishment of
the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no
hands stayed on her.
7 Her Nazarites were purer than
snow, they were whiter than milk,

they were more ruddy in body
than rubies, their polishing was of
sapphire:
8 Their visage is blacker than a
coal; they are not known in the
streets: their skin cleaveth to their
bones; it is withered, it is become
like a stick.
9 They that be slain with the sword
are better than they that be slain
with hunger: for these pine away,
stricken through for want of the
fruits of the field.
10 The hands of the pitiful a women
have b sodden their own children:
they were their c meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
11 The Lord hath accomplished
his fury; he hath poured out his
fierce anger, and hath kindled a
fire in Zion, and it hath devoured
the foundations thereof.
12 The kings of the earth, and all
the inhabitants of the world, would
not have believed that the adversary
and the enemy should have entered
into the gates of Jerusalem.
13 ¶ For the a sins of her prophets,
and the iniquities of her priests, that
have shed the blood of the b just in
the midst of her,
14 They have wandered as blind
men in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that
men could not touch their garments.
15 They cried unto them, Depart ye;
it is unclean; depart, depart, touch
not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen,
They shall no more sojourn there.
16 The anger of the Lord hath divided them; he will no more regard
them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured
not the a elders.
17 As for us, our eyes as yet failed
for our vain help: in our watching
we have watched for a a nation that
could not save us.

Ezekiel
Chapter 1
Ezekiel sees in vision four living crea­
tures, four wheels, and the glory of God
on His throne.
ow it came to pass in the
thirtieth year, in the fourth
month, in the fifth day of the
month, as I was among the a captives
by the river of b Chebar, that the
heavens were c opened, and I saw
d 
visions of God.
2 In the fifth day of the month,
which was the a fifth year of king
b 
Jehoiachin’s captivity,
3 The word of the Lord came
expressly unto Ezekiel the priest,
the son of Buzi, in the land of the
Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and
the a hand of the Lord was there
upon him.
4 ¶ And I looked, and, behold, a
a 
whirlwind came out of the north,
a great cloud, and a b fire infolding
itself, and a brightness was about it,
and out of the midst thereof as the
colour of amber, out of the midst
of the fire.
5 Also out of the midst thereof
came the likeness of four living
a 
creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of
a man.
6 And every one had four faces,
and every one had four wings.
7 And their feet were straight feet;
and the sole of their feet was like
the sole of a calf’s foot: and they
sparkled like the colour of burnished a brass.

8 And they had the hands of a man
under their wings on their four
sides; and they four had their faces
and their wings.
9 Their wings were joined one to
another; they turned not when they
went; they went every one a straight
forward.
10 As for the likeness of their
faces, they four had the face of a
man, and the face of a lion, on the
right side: and they four had the
face of an ox on the left side; they
four also had the face of an eagle.
11 Thus were their faces: and their
a 
wings were stretched upward; two
wings of every one were joined one
to another, and two covered their
bodies.
12 And they went ever y one
straight forward: whither the spirit
was to go, they went; and they turned
not when they went.
13 As for the likeness of the living
creatures, their appearance was like
burning coals of fire, and like the
appearance of a lamps: it went up
and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and
out of the fire went forth lightning.
14 And the living creatures ran
and returned as the appearance of
a flash of lightning.
15 ¶ Now as I beheld the living
creatures, behold one a wheel upon
the earth by the living creatures,
with his four faces.
16 The appearance of the a wheels
and their work was like unto the
colour of a beryl: and they four

had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were
a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
17 When they a went, they went
upon their four sides: and they
turned not when they went.
18 As for their rings, they were so
high that they were dreadful; and
their rings were full of eyes round
about them four.
19 And when the living creatures
went, the wheels went by them:
and when the living creatures were
lifted up from the earth, the wheels
were lifted up.
20 Whithersoever the a spirit was to
go, they went, thither was their spirit
to go; and the wheels were lifted up
over against them: for the spirit of
the living creature was in the wheels.
21 When those went, these went;
and when those stood, these stood;
and when those were lifted up from
the earth, the wheels were lifted up
over against them: for the spirit of
the living creature was in the wheels.
22 And the likeness of the a firmament upon the heads of the b living
creature was as the c colour of the
terrible d crystal, stretched forth
over their heads above.
23 And under the firmament were
their wings straight, the one toward
the other: every one had two, which
covered on this side, and every one
had two, which covered on that side,
their bodies.
24 And when they went, I heard
the noise of their wings, like the
noise of great waters, as the a voice
of the Almighty, the voice of speech,
as the noise of an host: when they
stood, they let down their wings.

25 And there was a voice from
the firmament that was over their
heads, when they stood, and had
let down their wings.
26 ¶ And above the firmament
that was over their heads was the
likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon
the likeness of the a throne was the
likeness as the b appearance of a
man above upon it.
27 And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of a fire round
about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and
from the appearance of his loins
even downward, I saw as it were
the appearance of fire, and it had
brightness round about.
28 As the appearance of the a bow
that is in the cloud in the day of
rain, so was the appearance of the
brightness round about. This was
the b appearance of the likeness of
the c glory of the d Lord. And when
I saw it, I e fell upon my face, and I
heard a voice of one that spake.

spake unto me.

to a b rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their
fathers have transgressed against
me, even unto this very day.
4 For they are impudent children
and a stiffhearted. I do b send thee
unto them; and thou shalt say unto
them, Thus saith the Lord God.
5 And they, whether they will hear,
or whether they will forbear, (for
they are a a rebellious house,) b yet
shall know that there hath been a
prophet among them.
6 ¶ And thou, son of man, a be not
b 
afraid of them, neither be afraid
of their words, though briers and
thorns be with thee, and thou dost
c 
dwell among scorpions: be not
afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they
be a rebellious house.
7 And thou shalt a speak my words
unto them, whether they will hear,
or whether they will forbear: for
they are most rebellious.
8 But thou, son of man, hear what
I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open
thy mouth, and a eat that I give thee.
9 ¶ And when I looked, behold, an
hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a
a 
roll of a b book was therein;
10 And he spread it before me;
and it was written a within and without: and there was written therein
lamentations, and mourning, and
woe.

2 So I opened my mouth, and he
caused me to eat that roll.
3 And he said unto me, Son of man,
cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy
bowels with this roll that I give thee.
Then did I a eat it; and it was in my
mouth as honey for sweetness.
4 ¶ And he said unto me, Son of
man, go, get thee unto the house
of Israel, and speak with my words
unto them.
5 For thou art not sent to a people
of a strange speech and of an hard
language, but to the house of Israel;
6 Not to many people of a strange
speech and of an hard language,
whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to
them, they would have a hearkened
unto thee.
7 But the house of Israel will not
hearken unto thee; for they will
not hearken unto me: for all the
house of Israel are impudent and
a 
hardhearted.
8 Behold, I have made thy face
strong against their faces, and thy
forehead strong against their foreheads.
9 As an a adamant harder than
flint have I made thy forehead: fear
them not, neither be dismayed at
their looks, though they be a rebellious house.
10 Moreover he said unto me, Son
of man, all my words that I shall
speak unto thee receive in thine
heart, and hear with thine ears.
11 And go, get thee to them of the
captivity, unto the children of thy
people, and speak unto them, and
tell them, Thus saith a the Lord God;

they will forbear.

12 Then the a spirit took me up,
and I heard behind me a voice of a
great rushing, saying, Blessed be the
glory of the Lord from his place.
13 I heard also the a noise of the
wings of the living creatures that
touched one another, and the noise
of the wheels over against them, and
a noise of a great rushing.
14 So the spirit lifted me up, and
took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but
the hand of the Lord was strong
upon me.
15 ¶ Then I came to them of the
captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by
the river of Chebar, and I sat where
they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.
16 And it came to pass at the end
of seven days, that the word of the
Lord came unto me, saying,
17 Son of man, I have made thee
a a watchman unto the house of
Israel: therefore hear the word at
my mouth, and give them b warning from me.
18 When I say unto the wicked,
Thou shalt surely a die; and thou
givest him not b warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his
wicked way, to save his life; the
same wicked man shall c die in his
d 
iniquity; but his blood will I e require at thine hand.
19 Yet if thou a warn the wicked,
and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he
shall die in his iniquity; but thou
hast delivered thy soul.
20 Again, When a a righteous man
doth b  turn from his c  righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I
lay a d stumblingblock before him,
he shall die: because thou hast not

21 Nevertheless if thou warn the

not, and he doth not sin, he shall

also thou hast delivered thy soul.
22 ¶ And the hand of the Lord was
there upon me; and he said unto me,
Arise, go forth into the a plain, and
I will there talk with thee.
23 Then I arose, and went forth into
the plain: and, behold, the glory of
the Lord stood there, as the glory
which I saw by the river of Chebar:
and I a fell on my face.
24 Then the spirit entered into
me, and set me upon my feet,
and spake with me, and said unto
me, Go, shut thyself within thine
house.
25 But thou, O son of man, behold,
they shall put bands upon thee,
and shall bind thee with them, and
thou shalt not go out among them:
26 And I will make thy tongue

thou shalt be a dumb, and shalt not
be to them a reprover: for they are

I will open thy a mouth, and thou
shalt say unto them, Thus b saith

him hear; and he that forbeareth,
let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.

Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie
upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.
5 For I have laid upon thee the
years of their iniquity, according
to the number of the days, three
hundred and ninety days: so shalt
thou bear the iniquity of the house
of Israel.
6 And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right
side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty
days: I have appointed thee each
day for a year.
7 Therefore thou shalt set thy face
toward the siege of Jerusalem, and
thine arm shall be uncovered, and
thou shalt prophesy against it.
8 And, behold, I will lay bands upon
thee, and thou shalt not turn thee
from one side to another, till thou
hast ended the days of thy siege.
9 ¶ Take thou also unto thee wheat,
and barley, and beans, and lentiles,
and millet, and a fitches, and put
them in one vessel, and make thee
bread thereof, according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie
upon thy side, three hundred and
ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.

cakes, and thou shalt bake it with
dung that cometh out of man, in

13 And the Lord said, Even thus
shall the children of Israel eat their
a 
defiled bread among the Gentiles,
whither I will drive them.
14 Then said I, Ah Lord God! behold, my soul hath not been a polluted: for from my youth up even
till now have I not eaten of that
which b dieth of itself, or is c torn in
pieces; neither came there d abominable flesh into my mouth.
15 Then he said unto me, Lo, I have
given thee cow’s dung for man’s
dung, and thou shalt prepare thy
bread therewith.
16 Moreover he said unto me, Son
of man, behold, I will break the staff
of bread in Jerusalem: and they
shall eat bread by weight, and with
care; and they shall drink water by
measure, and with a astonishment:
17 That they may want bread and
water, and be a astonied one with
another, and b consume away for

the days of the siege are fulfilled:
and thou shalt take a third part, and

third part thou shalt scatter in the

after them.
3 Thou shalt also take thereof a

4 Then take of them again, and cast
them into the midst of the fire, and

shall a fire come forth into all the

5 ¶ Thus saith the Lord God; This
is Jerusalem: I have set it in the
a 
midst of the nations and countries
that are round about her.
6 And she hath changed my judgments into a wickedness more than
the nations, and my statutes more
than the countries that are round
about her: for they have b refused
my judgments and my statutes, they
have not walked in them.
7 Therefore thus saith the Lord
God; Because ye multiplied more
than the nations that are round
about you, and have not walked
in my statutes, neither have kept
my a judgments, neither have done
according to the judgments of the
nations that are round about you;
8 Therefore thus saith the Lord
God; Behold, I, even I, am against
thee, and will execute judgments
in the midst of thee in the a sight
of the nations.
9 And I will do in thee that which
I have not a done, and whereunto I
will not do any more the like, because of all thine b abominations.
10 Therefore the fathers shall
a 
eat the sons in the midst of thee,
and the sons shall eat their fathers;

and I will execute judgments in
thee, and the whole remnant of thee
will I b scatter into all the winds.
11 Wherefore, as I live, saith the
Lord God; Surely, because thou
hast a defiled my sanctuary with all
thy b detestable things, and with
all thine abominations, therefore
will I also c diminish thee; neither
shall mine eye d spare, neither will I
have any pity.
12 ¶ A third part of thee shall die
with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the
midst of thee: and a third part shall
fall by the sword round about thee;
and I will scatter a third part into
all the winds, and I will draw out
a sword after them.
13 Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and a I will cause my
b 
fury to rest upon them, and I will
be comforted: and they shall know
that I the Lord have c spoken it in
my zeal, when I have accomplished
my fury in them.

waste, and a b reproach among the
nations that are round about thee,

15 So it shall be a a reproach and
a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that
are round about thee, when I shall
execute judgments in thee in anger
and in fury and in furious rebukes.
I the Lord have spoken it.
16 When I shall send upon them
the evil arrows of famine, which
shall be for their destruction, and
which I will send to destroy you:
and I will increase the famine
upon you, and will break your staff
of bread:

The people of Israel will be destroyed
for their idolatry—A remnant only will
be saved and scattered.
And the word of the Lord came

the b mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,
3 And say, Ye mountains of Israel,
hear the word of the Lord God; Thus
saith the Lord God to the mountains,
and to the hills, to the rivers, and
to the valleys; Behold, I, even I, will
bring a sword upon you, and I
will destroy your high places.
4 And your altars shall be desolate,
and your images shall be broken:
and I will cast down your slain men
before your idols.
5 And I will lay the dead a carcases
of the children of Israel before their
idols; and I will scatter your bones
round about your altars.
6 In all your dwellingplaces the
cities shall be laid waste, and the
high places shall be desolate; that
your altars may be laid waste and
made desolate, and your idols may
be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your
works may be abolished.
7 And the slain shall fall in the
midst of you, and ye shall a know that
I am the Lord.
8 ¶ Yet will I leave a a remnant,
that ye may have some that shall b escape the sword among the nations,
when ye shall be c scattered through
the countries.

tives, because I am broken with their
whorish heart, which hath departed
from me, and with their eyes, which
go a a whoring after their idols: and
they shall b lothe themselves for the
c 
evils which they have committed
in all their abominations.
10 And they shall know that I am
the Lord, and that I have not said
in vain that I would do this evil
unto them.
11 ¶ Thus saith the Lord God;
Smite with thine hand, and stamp
with thy foot, and say, Alas for all
the evil abominations of the house
of Israel! for they shall fall by
the sword, by the famine, and by the
pestilence.
12 He that is far off shall die of
the pestilence; and he that is near
shall fall by the sword; and he that
remaineth and is besieged shall die
by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.
13 Then shall ye know that I am
the Lord, when their slain men shall
be among their idols round about
their altars, upon every high hill,
in all the tops of the mountains,
and under every green tree, and
under every thick oak, the place
where they did offer sweet savour
to all their a idols.

upon them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the
wilderness toward Diblath, in all
their habitations: and they shall
know that I am the Lord.

the Lord God unto the land of Israel;
An a end, the end is come upon the
four corners of the land.
3 Now is the end come upon thee,
and I will send mine anger upon
thee, and will a judge thee according
to thy ways, and will recompense
upon thee all thine abominations.
4 And mine eye shall not a spare
thee, neither will I have pity: but
I will b recompense thy ways upon
thee, and thine abominations shall
be in the midst of thee: and ye shall
c 
know that I am the Lord.
5 Thus saith the Lord God; An
evil, an a only evil, behold, is b come.
6 An end is come, the end is come:
it watcheth for thee; behold, it is
come.
7 The morning is come unto thee,
O thou that dwellest in the land: the
time is come, the day of trouble is
near, and not the sounding again
of the mountains.
8 Now will I shortly pour out my
a 
fury upon thee, and accomplish
mine anger upon thee: and I will
judge thee according to thy ways,
and will recompense thee for all
thine abominations.
9 And mine eye shall not spare,
neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways
and thine abominations that are in
the midst of thee; and ye shall know
that I am the Lord that smiteth.
10 Behold the day, behold, it is
come: the morning is gone forth;
the rod hath blossomed, pride hath
budded.
11 Violence is risen up into a rod
of wickedness: none of them shall
remain, nor of their multitude, nor
of any of theirs: neither shall there
be a wailing for them.

is upon all the multitude thereof.
13 For the seller shall not return
to that which is sold, although
they were yet alive: for the vision
is touching the whole multitude
thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself

iniquity.

Chapter 8
Ezekiel sees in vision the wickedness
and abominations of the people of Judah in Jerusalem—He sees idolatry
practiced in the temple itself.
And it came to pass in the sixth
year, in the sixth month, in the fifth
day of the month, as I sat in mine
house, and the a elders of Judah sat
before me, that the b hand of the
Lord God fell there upon me.
2 Then I beheld, and lo a likeness
as the appearance of a fire: from

the appearance of his loins even
downward, fire; and from his loins
even upward, as the appearance of
brightness, as the colour of amber.
3 And he put forth the form of an
hand, and took me by a lock of mine
head; and the a spirit lifted me up
between the earth and the b heaven,
and brought me in the c visions
of God to Jerusalem, to the door of
the inner gate that looketh toward
the north; where was the seat of the
image of jealousy, which provoketh
to jealousy.
4 And, behold, a the glory of the
God of Israel was there, according
to the vision that I saw in the b plain.
5 ¶ Then said he unto me, Son
of man, lift up thine eyes now the
way toward the north. So I lifted
up mine eyes the way toward the
north, and behold northward at
the gate of the altar this image of
jealousy in the entry.
6 He said furthermore unto me,
Son of man, seest thou what they
do? even the great abominations that
the house of Israel committeth here,
that I should go far off from my sanctuary ? but turn thee yet again, and
thou shalt see greater abominations.
7 ¶ And he brought me to the door
of the court; and when I looked,
behold a hole in the wall.
8 Then said he unto me, Son of
man, dig now in the wall: and when
I had digged in the wall, behold a
door.
9 And he said unto me, Go in, and
behold the wicked a abominations
that they do here.
10 So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things,
and abominable beasts, and all the
idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about.

house of Israel, and in the midst
of them stood Jaazaniah the son of
Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud
of incense went up.
12 Then said he unto me, Son of
man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in
the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery ? for they say,
The Lord seeth us not; the Lord
hath forsaken the earth.
13 ¶ He said also unto me, Turn
thee yet again, and thou shalt see
greater abominations that they do.
14 Then he brought me to the
door of the gate of the Lord’s house
which was toward the north; and,
behold, there sat women weeping
for a Tammuz.
15 ¶ Then said he unto me, Hast
thou seen this, O son of man? turn
thee yet again, and thou shalt see
greater abominations than these.
16 And he brought me into the inner a court of the Lord’s house, and,
behold, at the door of the temple of
the Lord, between the b porch and
the altar, were about five and twenty
men, with their c  backs toward
the temple of the Lord, and their
faces toward the east; and they
worshipped d the sun toward the
east.
17 ¶ Then he said unto me, Hast
thou seen this, O son of man? Is it
a light thing to the house of Judah
that they commit the abominations
which they commit here? for they
have filled the land with violence,
and have returned to provoke me to
anger: and, lo, they put the branch
to their nose.
18 Therefore will I also deal in
fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though
they cry in mine ears with a loud
voice, yet will I not hear them.

Chapter 9
Ezekiel sees the marking of the righteous
and the slaughter of all others, beginning at the Lord’s sanctuary.
He cried also in mine ears with a
loud voice, saying, Cause them that
have charge over the city to draw
near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.
2 And, behold, six men came from
the way of the higher a gate, which
lieth toward the north, and every
man a slaughter weapon in his
hand; and one man among them
was b clothed with linen, with a
c 
writer’s d inkhorn by his side: and
they went in, and stood beside the
brasen e altar.
3 And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the a cherub,
whereupon he was, to the threshold
of the house. And he called to the
man clothed with linen, which had
the writer’s inkhorn by his side;
4 And the Lord said unto him,
Go through the midst of the city,
through the midst of Jerusalem, and
set a mark upon the a foreheads of
the men that sigh and that cry for
all the abominations that be done
in the midst thereof.
5 ¶ And to the others he said in
mine hearing, Go ye after him
through the city, and smite: let not
your eye spare, neither have ye pity:
6 Slay utterly old and young, both
maids, and little children, and
women: but come not near any man
upon whom is the mark; and a begin
at my sanctuary. Then they began
at the b ancient men which were
before the house.
7 And he said unto them, Defile
the house, and fill the courts with
the slain: go ye forth. And they went
forth, and slew in the city.

were slaying them, and I was left, that
I fell upon my face, and cried, and
said, Ah Lord God! wilt thou destroy
all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?
9 Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and
Judah is exceeding great, and the
land is full of blood, and the city
full of perverseness: for they say,
The Lord hath forsaken the earth,
and the Lord a seeth not.
10 And as for me also, mine eye
shall not spare, neither will I have
pity, but I will a recompense their
way upon their head.
11 And, behold, the man clothed
with linen, which had the inkhorn
by his side, reported the matter,
saying, I have done as thou hast
commanded me.
Chapter 10
He sees in vision, as before, the wheels,
the cherubims, and the throne and the
glory of God.
Then I looked, and, behold, in the
a 
firmament that was above the
head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of
the likeness of a b throne.
2 And he spake unto the man
clothed with linen, and said, Go
in between the wheels, even under
the cherub, and fill thine hand
with coals of fire from between the
cherubims, and a scatter them over
the city. And he went in in my sight.
3 Now the cherubims stood on the
right side of the house, when the
man went in; and the cloud filled
the inner court.
4 Then the glory of the Lord went
up from the cherub, and stood over
the threshold of the house; and the
house was filled with the a cloud, and
the court was full of the brightness
of the Lord’s glory.

5 And the sound of the cherubims’
wings was heard even to the outer
court, as the voice of the Almighty
God when he speaketh.
6 And it came to pass, that when he
had commanded the man clothed
with linen, saying, Take fire from
between the wheels, from between
the cherubims; then he went in, and
stood beside the wheels.
7 And one cherub stretched forth
his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between
the cherubims, and took thereof, and
put it into the hands of him that was
clothed with linen: who took it, and
went out.
8 ¶ And there appeared in the
cherubims the form of a man’s hand
under their wings.
9 And when I looked, behold the
four wheels by the cherubims, one
wheel by one cherub, and another
wheel by another cherub: and the
appearance of the a wheels was as
the colour of a beryl stone.
10 And as for their appearances,
they four had one likeness, as if a
wheel had been in the midst of
a wheel.
11 When they a went, they went
b 
upon their four sides; they turned
not as they went, but to the place
whither the c head looked they followed it; they turned not as they
went.
12 And their whole body, and their
backs, and their hands, and their
wings, and the wheels, were full of
eyes round about, even the wheels
that they four had.
13 As for the wheels, it was cried
unto them in my hearing, O wheel.
14 And every one had four faces:
the first face was the face of a
a 
cherub, and the second face was the
face of a man, and the third the face
of a lion, and the fourth the face of
an eagle.
15 And the cherubims a were lifted

up. This is the living creature that
I saw by the river of b Chebar.
16 And when the cherubims went,
the wheels went by them: and when
the cherubims lifted up their wings
to mount up from the earth, the
same wheels also turned not from
beside them.
17 When they stood, these stood; and
when they were lifted up, these lifted
up themselves also: for the a spirit
of the living creature was in them.
18 Then the a glory of the Lord
b 
departed from off the threshold
of the house, and stood over the
cherubims.
19 And the a cherubims lifted up
their wings, and mounted up from
the earth in my sight: when they
went out, the wheels also were beside them, and every one stood at the
door of the b east gate of the Lord’s
house; and the glory of the God of
Israel was over them above.
20 This is the a living creature that
I saw under the God of Israel by the
river of Chebar; and I knew that
they were the cherubims.
21 Every one had four faces apiece,
and every one four wings; and the
likeness of the hands of a man was
under their wings.
22 And the likeness of their faces
was the same faces which I saw by
the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went
every one straight forward.
Chapter 11
He sees in vision the destruction of Jerusalem and the captivity of the Jews—

and brought me unto the b east gate

eastward: and behold at the door

of the gate five and twenty men;
among whom I saw Jaazaniah the
son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son
of Benaiah, c princes of the people.
2 Then said he unto me, Son of
man, these are the men that devise
mischief, and give wicked counsel
in this city:
3 Which say, It is not near; let us
build houses: this city is the caldron,
and we be the flesh.
4 ¶ Therefore prophesy against
them, prophesy, O son of man.
5 And the a Spirit of the Lord fell
upon me, and said unto me, Speak;
Thus saith the Lord; Thus have ye
said, O house of Israel: for I b know
the things that come into your
c 
mind, every one of them.
6 Ye have multiplied your a slain
in this city, and ye have filled the
streets thereof with the slain.
7 Therefore thus saith the Lord
God; Your slain whom ye have laid
in the midst of it, they are the flesh,
and this city is the caldron: but I will
bring you forth out of the midst of it.
8 Ye have feared the sword; and I
will bring a sword upon you, saith
the Lord God.
9 And I will bring you out of the
midst thereof, and deliver you into
the hands of a strangers, and will
execute judgments among you.
10 Ye shall a fall by the sword; I
will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am
the Lord.
11 This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh
in the midst thereof; but I will judge
you in the border of Israel:
12 And ye shall know that I am
the Lord: for ye have not walked
in my statutes, neither executed my
a 
judgments, but have done after the
b 
manners of the c heathen that are
round about you.

13 ¶ And it came to pass, when I
prophesied, that Pelatiah the son
of Benaiah died. Then fell I down
upon my face, and cried with a loud
voice, and said, Ah Lord God! wilt
thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?
14 Again the word of the Lord
came unto me, saying,
15 Son of man, thy brethren, even
thy brethren, a the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel
wholly, are they unto whom the
inhabitants of Jerusalem have said,
Get you far from the Lord: unto
us is this land given in possession.
16 Therefore say, Thus saith the
Lord God; Although I have cast
them far off among the heathen,
and although I have scattered them
among the countries, yet will I be
to them as a little a sanctuary in the
countries where they shall come.
17 Therefore say, Thus saith the
Lord God; I will even a gather you
from the b people, and assemble you
out of the countries where ye have
been scattered, and I will give you
the c land of Israel.
18 And they shall come thither,
and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the
abominations thereof from thence.
19 And I will a give them one b heart,
and I will put a c new d spirit within
you; and I will take the stony heart
out of their flesh, and will give them
an e heart of flesh:
20 That they may a walk in my statutes, and keep mine b ordinances,
and do them: and they shall be my
c 
people, and I will be their God.

walketh after the heart of their

22 ¶ Then did the cherubims lift
up their wings, and the wheels
beside them; and the a glory of the
God of Israel was over them above.
23 And the a glory of the Lord went
up from the midst of the city, and
stood upon the mountain which is
on the east side of the city.
24 ¶ Afterwards the a spirit took me
up, and brought me in a vision by
the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to
them of the captivity. So the vision
that I had seen went up from me.
25 Then I spake unto them of the
captivity all the things that the
Lord had shewed me.
Chapter 12
Ezekiel makes himself a symbol of the
scattering of the people of Judah from
Jerusalem—He then prophesies their
scattering among all nations.
The word of the Lord also came
unto me, saying,
2 Son of man, thou dwellest in the
midst of a a rebellious house, which
have b eyes to see, and c see not; they
have ears to hear, and hear not: for
they are a rebellious house.
3 Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee a stuff for b removing, and
remove by day in their sight; and
thou shalt remove from thy place
to another place in their sight: it
may be they will consider, though
they be a rebellious house.
4 Then shalt thou bring forth thy
stuff by day in their sight, as stuff
for removing: and thou shalt go
forth at even in their sight, as they
that go forth into captivity.
5 Dig thou through the wall in
their sight, and carry out thereby.

6 In their sight shalt thou bear it
upon thy shoulders, and carry it forth
in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy
face, that thou see not the a ground:
for I have set thee for a b sign unto
the house of Israel.
7 And I did so as I was commanded:
I brought forth my stuff by day,
as stuff for captivity, and in the
a 
even I digged through the wall
with mine hand; I brought it forth
in the twilight, and I bare it upon
my shoulder in their sight.
8 ¶ And in the morning came the
word of the Lord unto me, saying,
9 Son of man, hath not the house
of Israel, the a rebellious house, said
unto thee, b What doest thou?
10 Say thou unto them, Thus saith
the Lord God; This burden concerneth
the prince in Jerusalem, and all the
house of Israel that are among them.
11 Say, I am your a sign: like as I
have b done, so shall it be done unto
them: they shall remove and go into
captivity.
12 And the prince that is among
them shall a bear upon his shoulder
in the twilight, and shall go forth:
they shall dig through the wall to
carry out thereby: he shall cover
his face, that he see not the ground
with his eyes.

yet shall he not c see it, though he
shall die there.
14 And I will a scatter toward every wind all that are about him to
help him, and all his b bands; and I
will draw out the c sword after them.

16 But I will leave a a few men
of them from the sword, from the
famine, and from the pestilence;
that they may declare all their
abominations among the heathen
whither they come; and they shall
know that I am the Lord.
17 ¶ Moreover the word of the
Lord came to me, saying,
18 Son of man, eat thy bread with
quaking, and drink thy water with
trembling and with a carefulness;
19 And say unto the people of the
land, Thus saith the Lord God of the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the
land of Israel; They shall eat their
bread with carefulness, and drink
their water with a astonishment, that
her land may be desolate from all
that is therein, because of the b violence of all them that dwell therein.
20 And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the
land shall be desolate; and ye shall
know that I am the Lord.
21 ¶ And the word of the Lord
came unto me, saying,
22 Son of man, what is that proverb
that ye have in the land of Israel,
saying, The days are prolonged, and
every vision faileth?
23 Tell them therefore, Thus saith
the Lord God; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more
use it as a proverb in Israel; but say
unto them, The days are at hand,
and the a effect of every vision.
24 For there shall be no more any
vain vision nor a flattering b divination within the house of Israel.

word, and will perform it, saith
the Lord God.
26 ¶ Again the word of the Lord
came to me, saying,
27 Son of man, behold, they of the
house of Israel say, The vision that
he seeth is for many days to come,
and he prophesieth of the times
that are a far off.
28 Therefore say unto them, Thus
saith the Lord God; There shall none

Chapter 13
Ezekiel reproves false prophets, both
male and female, who speak lies, to
whom God has not spoken.
And the word of the Lord came
unto me, saying,
2 Son of man, prophesy against
the a prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that
prophesy out of their own hearts,
Hear ye the word of the Lord;
3 Thus saith the Lord God; Woe
unto the a foolish prophets, that
follow their own spirit, and have
seen nothing!
4 O Israel, thy prophets are like
the foxes in the deserts.
5 Ye have not gone up into the
a 
gaps, neither made up the hedge
for the house of Israel to stand in
the battle in the day of the Lord.
6 They have seen vanity and lying
a 
divination, saying, The Lord saith:
and the Lord hath not sent them:
and they have made others to hope
that they would confirm the word.

and have ye not spoken a lying divi­

9 And mine hand shall be upon

that divine lies: they shall not be in
the assembly of my people, neither
shall they be written in the a writing of the house of Israel, neither
shall they b enter into the land of
Israel; and ye shall know that I am
the Lord God.
10 ¶ Because, even because they
have seduced my people, saying,
a 
Peace; and there was no peace; and
one built up a wall, and, lo, others
daubed it with untempered b mortar:
11 Say unto them which daub it
with untempered mortar, that it
shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great
hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy
wind shall rend it.
12 Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall
it not be said unto you, Where is
the a daubing wherewith ye have
daubed it?
13 Therefore thus saith the Lord
God; I will even rend it with a stormy
wind in my fury; and there shall
be an overflowing shower in mine
anger, and great a hailstones in my
fury to consume it.
14 So will I break down the wall
that ye have daubed with untempered mortar, and bring it down to
the ground, so that the foundation
thereof shall be discovered, and it
shall fall, and ye shall be consumed
in the midst thereof: and ye shall
know that I am the Lord.
15 Thus will I accomplish my
wrath upon the wall, and upon
them that have daubed it with untempered mortar, and will say unto
you, The wall is no more, neither
they that daubed it;

16 To wit, the prophets of Israel
which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of a peace
for her, and there is no peace, saith
the Lord God.
17 ¶ Likewise, thou son of man,
set thy face against the daughters
of thy people, which prophesy out
of their own heart; and prophesy
thou against them,
18 And say, Thus saith the Lord
God; Woe to the women that sew

souls of my people, and will ye save

tear them from your arms, and will
let the souls go, even the souls that
ye hunt to make them b fly.

—Ezekiel preaches repentance—The
people would not be saved though Noah,
Daniel, and Job ministered among
them.
Then came certain of the a elders of
Israel unto me, and sat before me.
2 And the word of the Lord came
unto me, saying,
3 Son of man, these men have set
up their idols in their heart, and
put the stumblingblock of their
a 
iniquity before their face: should
I be b inquired of at all by c them?
4 Therefore speak unto them, and
say unto them, Thus saith the Lord
God; Every man of the house of
Israel that setteth up his idols in
his heart, and putteth the a stumblingblock of his iniquity before
his face, and cometh to the prophet;
I the Lord will answer him that
cometh according to the multitude
of his idols;
5 That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they
are all estranged from me through
their idols.
6 ¶ Therefore say unto the house
of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God;
Repent, and turn yourselves from
your idols; and turn away your
faces from all your abominations.
7 For every one of the house of
Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, which separateth
himself from me, and setteth up
his idols in his heart, and putteth
the stumblingblock of his iniquity
before his face, and cometh to a
prophet to inquire of him concerning me; I the Lord will answer him
by myself:

from the midst of my people; and
ye shall know that I am the Lord.
9 And if the prophet be deceived
when he hath spoken a thing, a I the
Lord have deceived that prophet,
and I will stretch out my hand upon
him, and will destroy him from the
midst of my people Israel.
10 And they shall bear the a punishment of their iniquity: the
punishment of the prophet shall
be even as the punishment of him
that seeketh unto him;
11 That the house of Israel may
go no more astray from me, neither
be polluted any more with all their
transgressions; but that they may
be my a people, and I may be their
God, saith the Lord God.
12 ¶ The word of the Lord came
again to me, saying,
13 Son of man, when the land
sinneth against me by trespassing
grievously, then will I stretch out
mine hand upon it, and will a break
the staff of the bread thereof, and
will send famine upon it, and will
cut off man and beast from it:
14  a  Though these three men,
b 
Noah, c Daniel, and d Job, were in it,
they should deliver but their own
souls by their righteousness, saith
the Lord God.
15 ¶ If I cause a noisome beasts to
pass through the land, and they
spoil it, so that it be desolate, that
no man may pass through because
of the beasts:
16 Though these three men were
in it, as I live, saith the Lord God,
they shall deliver neither sons nor
daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.
17 ¶ Or if I bring a a sword upon
that land, and say, Sword, go through
the land; so that I cut off man and
beast from it:

they shall deliver neither sons nor

that land, and pour out my fury
upon it in blood, to cut off from it
man and beast:
20 Though Noah, Daniel, and
Job, were in it, as I live, saith the
Lord God, they shall deliver neither
son nor daughter; they shall but
deliver their own souls by their
righteousness.
21 For thus saith the Lord God;
How much more when I send my
four sore judgments upon Jerusalem,
the a sword, and the famine, and the
noisome beast, and the pestilence,
to cut off from it man and beast?
22 ¶ Yet, behold, therein shall be
left a a remnant that shall be brought
forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto
you, and ye shall see their way and
their doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I

concerning all that I have brought
upon it.
23 And they shall comfort you,
when ye see their ways and their
doings: and ye shall know that I have
not done without cause all that I
have done in it, saith the Lord God.
Chapter 15
Jerusalem, as a useless vine, will be
burned.
And the word of the Lord came
unto me, saying,
2 Son of man, What is the vine
tree more than any tree, or than a
branch which is among the trees
of the forest?
3 Shall wood be taken thereof to
do any work? or will men take a pin
of it to hang any vessel thereon?
4 Behold, it is cast into the fire for
fuel; the fire devoureth both the

ends of it, and the midst of it is
burned. Is it meet for any work?
5 Behold, when it was whole, it was
meet for no work: how much less
shall it be meet yet for any work,
when the fire hath devoured it, and
it is burned?
6 ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord
God; As the a vine tree among the
trees of the forest, which I have
given to the fire for fuel, so will I
give the inhabitants of b Jerusalem.
7 And I will set my face against
them; they shall go out from one
fire, and another fire shall devour
them; and ye shall know that I
am the Lord, when I set my face
against them.
8 And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed
a trespass, saith the Lord God.
Chapter 16
Jerusalem has become as a harlot, reveling in her idols and worshipping false
gods—She has partaken of all the sins
of Egypt and the nations round about,
and she is rejected—Yet in the last days,
the Lord will again establish His covenant with her.
Again the word of the Lord came
unto me, saying,
2 Son of man, cause Jerusalem to
know her a abominations,
3 And say, Thus saith the Lord God
unto Jerusalem; Thy a birth and thy
nativity is of the land of Canaan;
thy father was an Amorite, and thy
b 
mother an Hittite.
4 And as for thy nativity, in the
day thou wast a born thy b navel was
not cut, neither wast thou washed
in water to c supple thee; thou wast
not salted at all, nor swaddled
at all.
5 None eye pitied thee, to do any
of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast

out in the open field, to the lothing
of thy person, in the day that thou
wast born.
6 ¶ And when I passed by thee,
and saw thee polluted in thine
own blood, I said unto thee when
thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea,
I said unto thee when thou wast in
thy blood, Live.
7 I have caused thee to multiply
as the bud of the field, and thou
hast increased and a waxen great,
and thou art come to excellent ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned,
and thine hair is grown, whereas
thou wast b naked and bare.
8 Now when I passed by thee, and
looked upon thee, behold, thy time
was the time of a love; and I spread
my skirt over thee, and covered thy
nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee,
and entered into a covenant with
thee, saith the Lord God, and thou
becamest mine.
9 Then washed I thee with water;
yea, I throughly a washed away thy
blood from thee, and I anointed
thee with oil.
10 I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with
badgers’ skin, and I girded thee
about with fine linen, and I covered
thee with silk.
11 I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon
thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.
12 And I put a jewel on thy a forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and
a beautiful crown upon thine head.
13 Thus wast thou decked with
gold and silver; and thy raiment was
of fine linen, and silk, and broidered
work; thou didst eat fine flour, and
honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst
prosper into a kingdom.
14 And thy a renown went forth
among the heathen for thy beauty:
for it was perfect through my

comeliness, which I had put upon
thee, saith the Lord God.
15 ¶ But thou didst trust in thine
own beauty, and playedst the a harlot
because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every
one that passed by; his it was.
16 And of thy garments thou didst
take, and deckedst thy high places
with divers colours, and playedst
the harlot thereupon: the like things
shall not come, neither shall it
be so.
17 Thou hast also taken thy fair
jewels of my gold and of my silver,
which I had given thee, and madest to thyself a images of men, and
didst commit whoredom with them,
18 And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou
hast set mine oil and mine incense
before them.
19 My meat also which I gave thee,
fine a flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set
it before them for a sweet savour:
and thus it was, saith the Lord God.
20 Moreover thou hast taken thy
sons and thy daughters, whom thou
hast borne unto me, and these hast
thou a sacrificed unto them to be
devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms
a small matter,
21 That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause
them to pass through the fire for
them?
22 And in all thine abominations
and thy whoredoms thou hast not
remembered the days of thy youth,
when thou wast naked and bare, and
wast polluted in thy blood.
23 And it came to pass after all thy
wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee!
saith the Lord God;)
24 That thou hast also built unto
thee an eminent place, and hast
made thee an high place in every
street.

and hast opened thy feet to every

26 Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy
neighbours, great of flesh; and hast
increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.
27 Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have
diminished a thine ordinary food,
and delivered thee unto the will
of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are
ashamed of thy lewd way.
28 Thou hast played the whore
also with the a Assyrians, because
thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast
played the harlot with them, and
yet couldest not be satisfied.
29 Thou hast moreover multiplied
thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou
wast not satisfied herewith.
30 How weak is thine heart, saith
the Lord God, seeing thou doest all
these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman;
31 In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way,
and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an
harlot, in that thou scornest hire;
32 But as a wife that committeth
adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her a husband!
33 They give gifts to all whores:
but thou givest thy gifts to all thy
lovers, and a hirest them, that they
may come unto thee on every side
for thy whoredom.
34 And the contrary is in thee
from other women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee
to commit whoredoms: and in that
thou givest a reward, and no reward
is given unto thee, therefore thou
art contrary.

35 ¶ Wherefore, O harlot, hear the

36 Thus saith the Lord God; Because thy a filthiness was poured
out, and thy nakedness discovered
through thy whoredoms with thy
lovers, and with all the idols of thy
b 
abominations, and by the blood of
thy children, which thou didst give
unto them;
37 Behold, therefore I will gather
all thy lovers, with whom thou
hast taken pleasure, and all them
that thou hast loved, with all
them that thou hast a hated; I will
even gather them round about
b 
against thee, and will discover thy
c 
nakedness unto them, that they
may see all thy nakedness.
38 And I will a judge thee, as women
that break wedlock and shed blood
are judged; and I will give thee
blood in fury and jealousy.
39 And I will also give thee into
their hand, and they shall throw
down thine eminent place, and shall
break down thy high places: they
shall a strip thee also of thy clothes,
and shall take thy fair jewels, and
leave thee naked and bare.
40 They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall
stone thee with stones, and thrust
thee through with their swords.
41 And they shall a burn thine
houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many
women: and I will cause thee to
cease from playing the harlot, and
thou also shalt give no hire any more.
42 So will I make my fury toward
thee to rest, and my jealousy shall
depart from thee, and I will be
quiet, and will be no more angry.
43 Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but
hast fretted me in all these things;

proverbs shall use this proverb
against thee, saying, As is the
mother, so is her daughter.
45 Thou art thy mother’s daughter, that lotheth her husband and
her children; and thou art the sister
of thy sisters, which lothed their
husbands and their children: your
a 
mother was an Hittite, and your

46 And thine elder a sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell
at thy left hand: and thy younger
sister, that dwelleth at thy right
hand, is b Sodom and her daughters.
47 Yet hast thou not walked after
their ways, nor done after their
abominations: but, as if that were a
very little thing, thou wast corrupted
more than they in all thy ways.
48 As I live, saith the Lord God,
a 
Sodom thy sister hath not done,

done, thou and thy daughters.

was in her and in her daughters,
neither did she strengthen the hand
of the poor and needy.

committed a abomination before
me: therefore I took them b away c as

for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they:
they are more righteous than thou:
yea, be thou confounded also, and
bear thy shame, in that thou hast
justified thy sisters.
53 When I shall bring again their
captivity, the captivity of Sodom
and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters,
then will I a bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst
of them:
54 That thou mayest bear thine

in that thou art a comfort unto them.
55 When thy sisters, Sodom and
her daughters, shall return to their
former a estate, and Samaria and
her daughters shall return to their
former estate, then thou and thy
daughters shall return to your former estate.
56 For thy sister Sodom was not
mentioned by thy mouth in the day
of thy pride,
57 Before thy wickedness was
discovered, as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of a Syria,
and all that are round about her, the
daughters of the Philistines, which
despise thee round about.

and thine abominations, saith the

Chapter 17
Ezekiel shows in a parable how Israel,
while subject to Babylon, wrongfully
sought help from Egypt—Yet the Lord
will bring forth in the last days a goodly
tree from the cedars of Lebanon.
And the word of the Lord came
unto me, saying,
2 Son of man, put forth a riddle,
and speak a parable unto the house
of Israel;
3 And say, Thus saith the Lord God;
A great a eagle with great wings,
longwinged, full of feathers, which
had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch
of the cedar:
4 He cropped off the top of his
young twigs, and a carried it into a
land of b traffick; he set it in a city
of merchants.
5 He took also of the seed of the
land, and a planted it in a fruitful
field; he placed it by great waters,
and set it as a willow tree.
6 And it grew, and became a spreading a vine of low stature, whose
branches turned toward him, and
the roots thereof were under him:
so it became a vine, and brought
forth branches, and shot forth
sprigs.
7 There was also another great
eagle with great wings and many
feathers: and, behold, this vine did
bend her roots toward him, and shot

forth her branches toward him, that
he might water it by the furrows of
her plantation.
8 It was planted in a a good soil by
great waters, that it might bring
forth branches, and that it might
bear fruit, that it might be a goodly
vine.
9 Say thou, Thus saith the Lord
God; Shall it prosper? shall he not
pull up the roots thereof, and cut off
the fruit thereof, that it wither? it
shall wither in all the leaves of her
spring, even without great power or
many people to pluck it up by the
roots thereof.
10 Yea, behold, being planted, shall
it prosper? shall it not utterly wither,
when the a east b wind toucheth it? it
shall wither in the furrows where
it grew.
11 ¶ Moreover the word of the
Lord came unto me, saying,
12 Say now to the a rebellious house,
Know ye not what these things
mean? tell them, Behold, the b king
of Babylon is come to Jerusalem,
and hath taken the king thereof,
and the princes thereof, and led
them with him to Babylon;
13 And hath taken of the king’s
a 
seed, and made a covenant with
him, and hath taken an b oath of
him: he hath also taken the c mighty
of the land:
14 That the kingdom might be
base, that it might not lift itself up,
but that by keeping of his covenant
it might stand.
15 But he a rebelled against him
in sending his ambassadors into
Egypt, that they might give him
horses and much people. Shall he
prosper? shall he escape that doeth
such things? or shall he break the
covenant, and be delivered?

will also take of the highest a branch

will crop off from the top of his

plant it upon an high mountain

of Israel will I plant it: and it shall

shall they dwell.

a 
cruelly oppressed, spoiled his
brother by violence, and did that
which is not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his
iniquity.
19 ¶ Yet say ye, Why ? doth not the
son bear the iniquity of the father?
When the son hath done that which
is lawful and right, and hath kept all
my statutes, and hath done them,
he shall surely live.
20 The soul that a sinneth, it shall
die. The son shall not b bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall
the father bear the iniquity of the
son: the c righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the
wickedness of the wicked shall be
upon him.
21 But if the wicked will a turn
from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and
do that which is lawful and right,
he shall surely live, he shall not die.
22 All his a transgressions that he
hath committed, they shall not be
mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he
shall live.
23 Have I any a pleasure at all that
the wicked should die? saith the
Lord God: and not that he should
return from his ways, and live?
24 ¶ But when the a righteous b turneth away from his c righteousness,
and committeth iniquity, and doeth
according to all the abominations
that the wicked man doeth, shall he
live? All his righteousness that he
hath done shall not be mentioned:
in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his d sin that he hath
sinned, in them shall he die.

are not your ways unequal?
26 When a righteous man a turneth
away from his righteousness, and
committeth iniquity, and b dieth in
them; for his iniquity that he hath
done shall he die.
27 Again, when the wicked man
a 
turneth away from his wickedness
that he hath committed, and doeth
that which is lawful and right, he
shall save his soul alive.
28 Because he considereth, and
turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed,
he shall surely live, he shall not die.
29 Yet saith the house of Israel,
The way of the Lord is not a equal.
O house of Israel, are not my ways
equal? are not your ways unequal?
30 Therefore I will a judge you, O
house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord God.
Repent, and turn yourselves from all
your b transgressions; so iniquity
shall not be your ruin.
31 ¶ a Cast away from you all your
transgressions, whereby ye have
transgressed; and make you a new

death of him that dieth, saith the
Lord God: wherefore turn yourselves,

Ezekiel 19:3–20:5

A a lioness: she lay down among
lions, she nourished her whelps
among young lions.
3 And she brought up one of her
a 
whelps: it became a young lion,
and it learned to catch the prey; it
devoured men.
4 The nations also heard of him;
he was taken in their pit, and they
brought him with a chains unto the
land of b Egypt.
5 Now when she saw that she had
waited, and her hope was lost, then
she took another of her whelps, and
made him a young lion.
6 And he went up and down among
the lions, he became a young lion,
and learned to catch the prey, and
a 
devoured men.
7 And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities;
and the land was desolate, and the
fulness thereof, by the noise of his
roaring.
8 Then the nations set a against him
on every side from the provinces,
and spread their net over him: he
was b taken in their c pit.
9 And they put him in ward in
a 
chains, and brought him to the
king of Babylon: they brought him
into b holds, that his voice should
no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.
10 ¶ Thy mother is like a a vine b in
thy blood, planted by the waters:
she was fruitful and full of branches
by reason of many waters.
11 And she had strong rods for the
sceptres of them that bare rule, and
her stature was exalted among the
thick branches, and she appeared
in her height with the multitude
of her branches.
12 But she was plucked up in fury,
she was cast down to the ground, and

the a east b wind dried up her fruit:
her strong rods were broken and

13 And now she is planted in the

wilderness, in a dry and thirsty
ground.
14 And a fire is gone out of a b rod of

Chapter 20
From the time of their deliverance from
Egypt to the day of Ezekiel, the people of
Israel have rebelled and failed to keep
the commandments—In the last days,
the Lord will gather Israel and restore
His gospel covenant.
And it came to pass in the seventh
a 
year, in the fifth month, the tenth
day of the month, that certain of the
b 
elders of Israel came to inquire of
the Lord, and sat before me.
2 Then came the word of the Lord
unto me, saying,
3 Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them,
Thus saith the Lord God; Are ye
come to inquire of me? As I live,
saith the Lord God, I will not be
a 
inquired of by you.
4 Wilt thou judge them, son of
man, wilt thou judge them? cause
them to know the a abominations
of their fathers:
5 ¶ And say unto them, Thus saith
the Lord God; In the day when I
a 
chose Israel, and b lifted up mine
hand unto the seed of the house of
Jacob, and made myself known unto
them in the land of Egypt, when
I lifted up mine hand unto them,
saying, I am the c Lord your God;

6 In the day that I lifted up mine
hand unto them, to a bring them
forth of the land of Egypt into a
b 
land that I had c espied for them,
flowing with milk and honey, which
is the d glory of all lands:
7 Then said I unto them, a Cast ye
away every man the abominations
of his eyes, and defile not yourselves
with the idols of Egypt: I am the
Lord your God.
8 But they rebelled against me,
and would not hearken unto me:
they did not every man cast away
the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of
Egypt: then I said, I will pour out
my a fury upon them, to accomplish
my anger against them in the midst
of the land of Egypt.
9 But I wrought for my a name’s
sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among
whom they were, in whose sight I
made myself known unto them, in
bringing them forth out of the land
of Egypt.
10 ¶ Wherefore I a caused them to
go forth out of the land of Egypt, and
brought them into the wilderness.
11 And I gave them my a statutes,
and shewed them my judgments,
which if a man do, he shall even
b 
live in them.
12 Moreover also I gave them my
a 
sabbaths, to be a sign between me
and them, that they might know
that I am the Lord that b sanctify
them.
13 But the house of Israel a rebelled
against me in the wilderness: they
walked not in my statutes, and they
b 
despised my judgments, which if a
man do, he shall even live in them;
and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out

14 But I wrought for my name’s
sake, that it should not be polluted
before the heathen, in whose sight
I brought them out.
15 Yet also I lifted up my hand
unto them in the wilderness, that
I would not bring them into the
a 
land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is
the glory of all lands;
16 Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for
their a heart went after their idols.
17 Nevertheless mine eye a spared
them from destroying them, neither
did I make an end of them in the
wilderness.
18 But I said unto their children
in the wilderness, Walk ye not in
the statutes of your a fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor
defile yourselves with their idols:
19 I am the Lord your God; walk
in my a statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;
20 And a hallow my sabbaths; and
they shall be a b sign between me
and you, that ye may know that I
am the Lord your God.
21 Notwithstanding the children
a 
rebelled against me: they walked
not in my statutes, neither kept my
judgments to do them, which if a
man do, he shall even live in them;
they polluted my sabbaths: then
I said, I would pour out my fury
upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
22 Nevertheless I withdrew mine
hand, and wrought for my name’s
sake, that it should not be polluted
in the sight of the heathen, in whose
sight I brought them forth.

Ezekiel 20:23–39

23 I lifted up mine hand unto
them also in the wilderness, that
I would a scatter them among the
heathen, and disperse them through
the countries;
24 Because they had not executed
my judgments, but had despised
my statutes, and had polluted my
sabbaths, and their eyes were after
their fathers’ idols.
25 Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live;
26 And I polluted them in their
own gifts, in that they caused to
pass a through the b fire all that openeth the womb, that I might make
them desolate, to the c end that they
might d know that I am the Lord.
27 ¶ Therefore, son of man, speak
unto the house of Israel, and say
unto them, Thus saith the Lord
God; Yet in this your fathers have
a 
blasphemed me, in that they have
committed a trespass against me.
28 For when I had brought them
into the land, for the which I lifted
up mine hand to give it to them,
then they saw every high hill, and
all the thick trees, and they offered
there their sacrifices, and there they
presented the provocation of their
offering: there also they made their
sweet savour, and poured out there
their drink offerings.
29 Then I said unto them, What
is the high place whereunto ye
go? And the name thereof is called
Bamah unto this day.
30 Wherefore say unto the house
of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God;
Are ye polluted after the manner
of your fathers? and commit ye
whoredom after their abominations?

32 And that which cometh into
your a mind shall not be at all, that
ye say, We will be as the b heathen,

33 ¶ As I live, saith the Lord God,
surely with a mighty hand, and with
a stretched out arm, and with fury
poured out, will I rule over you:
34 And I will bring you out from
the people, and will a gather you
out of the countries wherein ye are

you into the bond of the c covenant:

among you the b rebels, and them
that transgress against me: I will

shall not c enter into the d land of

thus saith the Lord God; Go ye, serve

40 For in mine holy a mountain,
in the mountain of the height of
Israel, saith the Lord God, there
shall all the house of b Israel, all of
them in the land, serve me: there
will I c accept them, and there will
I require your offerings, and the
firstfruits of your oblations, with
all your holy things.
41 I will accept you with your
sweet savour, when I bring you out
from the people, and a gather you
out of the countries wherein ye have
been scattered; and I will be b sanctified in you before the heathen.
42 And ye shall a know that I am the
Lord, when I shall bring you into
the land of Israel, into the country
for the which I b lifted up mine hand
to give it to your fathers.
43 And there shall ye a remember
your ways, and all your doings,
wherein ye have been defiled; and
ye shall lothe yourselves in your
own sight for all your evils that ye
have committed.
44 And ye shall know that I am the
Lord, when I have wrought with you
for my name’s sake, not according to
your wicked ways, nor according

45 ¶ Moreover the word of the
Lord came unto me, saying,
46 Son of man, set thy a face toward
the south, and b drop thy word toward
the south, and prophesy against the
forest c of the south field;
47 And say to the forest of the
south, Hear the word of the Lord;
Thus saith the Lord God; Behold,

Chapter 21
Both the righteous and the wicked in
Jerusalem will be slain—Babylon will

And the word of the Lord came
unto me, saying,
2 Son of man, set thy a face toward
Jerusalem, and b drop thy word toward the holy places, and prophesy
against the c land of Israel,
3 And say to the land of Israel,
Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I am

will cut off from thee the righteous

4 Seeing then that I will cut off
from thee the righteous and the

go forth out of his sheath against all

5 That all flesh may know that

9 Son of man, prophesy, and say,
Thus saith the Lord; Say, A sword,
a sword is sharpened, and also a furbished:
10 It is sharpened to make a sore
slaughter; it is furbished that it may
glitter: should we then make mirth?
it contemneth the rod of my son,
as every tree.
11 And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be a handled:
this sword is sharpened, and it is
furbished, to give it into the hand
of the slayer.
12 Cry and howl, son of man: for
it shall be upon my people, it shall
be upon all the princes of Israel:
terrors by reason of the sword shall
be upon my people: smite therefore
upon thy thigh.
13 Because it is a a trial, and what if
the sword b contemn even the rod? it
shall be no more, saith the Lord God.
14 Thou therefore, son of man,
prophesy, and smite thine hands
together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of
the slain: it is the sword of the great
men that are slain, which entereth
into their privy chambers.
15 I have set the point of the sword
against all their gates, that their
heart may faint, and their ruins be
multiplied: ah! it is made bright,
it is wrapped up for the slaughter.
16 Go thee one way or other, either
on the right hand, or on the left,
whithersoever thy face is set.
17 I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my a fury to
rest: I the Lord have said it.
18 ¶ The word of the Lord came
unto me again, saying,

choose it at the head of the way to
the city.
20 Appoint a way, that the sword
may come to a Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem
the defenced.
21 For the king of Babylon stood
at the parting of the way, at the
head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright,
he consulted with images, he looked
in the liver.
22 At his right hand was the divi­
nation for Jerusalem, to appoint
captains, to open the mouth in the
slaughter, to lift up the voice with
shouting, to appoint a battering rams
against the gates, to cast b a mount,
and to build c a fort.
23 And it shall be unto them as
a false divination in their sight, to
them that have sworn oaths: but
he will call to remembrance the
iniquity, that they may be a taken.
24 Therefore thus saith the Lord
God; Because ye have made your
iniquity to be remembered, in that
your a transgressions are discovered,
so that in all your doings your sins
do appear; because, I say, that ye are
come to remembrance, ye shall be
b 
taken with the hand.
25 ¶ And thou, profane a wicked
prince of Israel, whose b day is come,
when iniquity shall have an end,
26 Thus saith the Lord God; Remove the a diadem, and take off the
crown: this shall not be the same:

Chapter 23
Two sisters, Samaria and Jerusalem,
committed whoredoms by worshipping
idols—Both are destroyed for their
lewdness.
The word of the Lord came again
unto me, saying,
2 Son of man, there were two
women, the a  daughters of one
mother:
3 And they committed whoredoms
in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were
their breasts pressed, and there they
bruised the teats of their virginity.
4 And the names of them were
a 
Aholah the elder, and b Aholibah
her sister: and they were mine,
and they bare sons and daughters.
Thus were their names; Samaria is
Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.
5 And Aholah played the harlot
when she was mine; and she doted
on her lovers, on the a Assyrians her
neighbours,
6 Which were clothed with blue,
captains and rulers, all of them
desirable young men, horsemen
riding upon horses.
7 Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that
were the chosen men of Assyria, and
with all on whom she doted: with
all their idols she defiled herself.
8 Neither left she her whoredoms
brought from Egypt: for in her youth
they lay with her, and they bruised
the breasts of her virginity, and
poured their whoredom upon her.
9 Wherefore I have delivered her
into the hand of her lovers, into the
hand of the Assyrians, upon whom
she doted.
10 These discovered her nakedness:
they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword:
and she became famous among
women; for they had executed judgment upon her.

Ezek. 16:46 (45–46, 61).
	4	a	 heb  A tent.
		b	 heb  My tent is in her.

11 And when her sister Aholibah
saw this, she was more corrupt in
her inordinate love than she, and
in her whoredoms more than her
sister in her whoredoms.
12 She doted upon the a Assyrians
her neighbours, captains and rulers
clothed most gorgeously, horsemen
riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.
13 Then I saw that she was defiled,
that they took both one way,
14 And that she increased her
whoredoms: for when she saw men
portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed
with vermilion,
15 Girded with girdles upon their
loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon
their heads, all of them princes to
look to, after the manner of the
Babylonians of Chaldea, the land
of their nativity:
16 And as soon as she saw them
with her eyes, she doted upon them,
and sent messengers unto them into
Chaldea.
17 And the Babylonians came to
her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and
she was a polluted with them, and
her mind was alienated b from them.
18 So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated
from her, like as my mind was
alienated from her sister.
19 Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance
the days of her youth, wherein she
had played the harlot in the land
of Egypt.
20 For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh
of asses, and whose issue is like the
issue of horses.
21 Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in
bruising thy teats by the Egyptians
for the paps of thy youth.

22 ¶ Therefore, O Aholibah, thus
saith the Lord God; Behold, I will
raise up thy lovers against thee,
a 
from whom thy mind is alienated,
and I will bring them b against thee
on every side;
23 The Babylonians, and all the
Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and
Koa, and all the Assyrians with
them: all of them desirable young
men, captains and rulers, great lords
and renowned, all of them riding
upon horses.
24 And they shall come against
thee with chariots, wagons, and
wheels, and with an assembly of
people, which shall set against thee
buckler and shield and helmet
round about: and I will set judgment
before them, and they shall a judge
thee according to their judgments.
25 And I will set my jealousy
against thee, and they shall deal
furiously with thee: they shall take
away thy nose and thine ears; and
thy remnant shall a fall by the sword:
they shall take thy sons and thy
daughters; and thy residue shall
be devoured by the fire.
26 They shall also a strip thee out
of thy clothes, and take away thy
fair jewels.
27 Thus will I make thy lewdness
to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt:
so that thou shalt not lift up thine
eyes unto them, nor remember
Egypt any more.
28 For thus saith the Lord God;
Behold, I will deliver thee into the
hand of them whom thou a hatest,
into the hand of them from whom
thy mind is alienated:
29 And they shall deal with thee
hatefully, and shall take away all
thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness
of thy whoredoms shall be discov	22	a	 jst  Ezek. 23:22 . . . by

ered, both thy lewdness and thy
whoredoms.
30 I will do these things unto thee,
because thou hast gone a a whoring
after the heathen, and because thou
art polluted with their idols.
31 Thou hast walked in the way
of thy sister; therefore will I give
her a cup into thine hand.
32 Thus saith the Lord God; Thou
shalt drink of thy sister’s cup deep
and large: thou shalt be laughed to
scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.
33 Thou shalt be filled with
a 
drunkenness and sorrow, with
the cup of astonishment and deso­
lation, with the cup of thy sister
Samaria.
34 Thou shalt even drink it and
suck it out, and thou shalt break
the sherds thereof, and pluck off
thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God.
35 Therefore thus saith the Lord
God; Because thou hast a forgotten
me, and cast me behind thy back,
therefore b bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
36 ¶ The Lord said moreover unto
me; Son of man, wilt thou judge
Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare
unto them their abominations;
37 That they have committed
a 
adultery, and blood is in their
hands, and with their idols have
they committed b  adultery, and
have also caused their sons, whom
they bare unto me, to pass for them
through the fire, to devour them.
38 Moreover this they have done
unto me: they have a defiled my
sanctuary in the same day, and have
profaned my sabbaths.
39 For when they had slain their
children to their idols, then they
came the same day into my sanctuary to a profane it; and, lo, thus

40 And furthermore, that ye have
sent for men to come from far, unto
whom a messenger was sent; and,
lo, they came: for whom thou didst
wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and
deckedst thyself with a ornaments,
41 And satest upon a stately bed,
and a table prepared before it,
whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.
42 And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with
the men of the common sort were
brought a Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their
hands, and beautiful crowns upon
their heads.
43 Then said I unto her that was
old in adulteries, Will they now
commit whoredoms with her, and
she with them?
44 Yet they went in unto her, as
they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto
Aholah and unto Aholibah, the
lewd women.
45 ¶ And the righteous men, they
shall a judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the
manner of women that shed blood;
because they are adulteresses, and
blood is in their hands.
46 For thus saith the Lord God; I
will bring up a company upon them,
and will give them to be removed
and spoiled.
47 And the company shall stone
them with stones, and dispatch
them with their swords; they shall
slay their a sons and their daughters,
and burn up their houses with fire.
48 Thus will I cause lewdness to
cease out of the land, that all women
may be taught not to do after your
lewdness.

The irrevocable judgment of Jerusalem is foretold—As a sign to the Jews,
Ezekiel does not weep at his wife’s
death.
Again in the a ninth year, in the
tenth month, in the tenth day of
the month, the word of the Lord
came unto me, saying,
2 Son of man, write thee the name
of the day, even of this same day:
the a king of b Babylon set himself
against Jerusalem this same day.
3 And utter a parable unto the a rebellious house, and say unto them,
Thus saith the Lord God; Set on a
b 
pot, set it on, and also pour water
into it:
4 Gather the pieces thereof into
it, even every good piece, the thigh,
and the shoulder; fill it with the
choice bones.
5 Take the choice of the flock,
and burn also the bones under it,
and make it boil well, and let them
seethe the bones of it therein.
6 ¶ Wherefore thus saith the Lord
God; Woe to the a bloody city, to
the pot whose scum is therein, and
whose b scum is not gone out of it!
bring it out piece by piece; c let no
lot fall upon it.
7 For her blood is in the midst of
her; she set it upon the top of a rock;
she poured it not upon the ground,
to a cover it with dust;
8 That it might cause fury to come
up to take vengeance; I have set her
blood upon the top of a rock, that
it should not be covered.
9 Therefore thus saith the Lord
God; Woe to the bloody city! I will
even make the pile for fire great.

10 Heap on wood, kindle the fire,
consume the flesh, and spice it well,
and let the bones be burned.
11 Then set it empty upon the
coals thereof, that the brass of it
may be hot, and may burn, and that
the filthiness of it may be molten
in it, that the scum of it may be
consumed.
12 She hath wearied herself with
lies, and her great scum went not
forth out of her: her scum shall be
in the fire.
13 In thy a filthiness is lewdness:
because I have purged thee, and
thou wast not purged, thou shalt
not be b purged from thy filthiness
any more, till c I have caused my
fury to rest upon thee.
14 I the Lord have spoken it: it
shall come to pass, and I will a do
it; I will not go back, neither will I
spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to
thy doings, shall they judge thee,
saith the Lord God.
15 ¶ Also the word of the Lord
came unto me, saying,
16 Son of man, behold, I take away
from thee the desire of thine eyes
with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou
mourn nor weep, neither shall thy
tears run down.
17 Forbear to cry, make no a mourning for the dead, bind the b tire of
thine c head upon thee, and put on
thy shoes upon thy feet, and d cover
not thy lips, and eat not the bread
of men.
18 So I spake unto the people in
the morning: and at even my wife
died; and I did in the morning as I
was commanded.
19 ¶ And the people said unto me,
Wilt thou not tell us a what these
things are to us, that thou doest so?

and your daughters whom ye have
left shall fall by the sword.
22 And ye shall do as I have done:
ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat
the bread of men.
23 And your tires shall be upon your
heads, and your shoes upon your
feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep;
but ye shall pine away for your
iniquities, and a mourn one toward
another.
24 Thus Ezekiel is unto you a

cometh, ye shall know that I am

whereupon they set their minds,

26 That he that a escapeth in that
day shall come unto thee, to cause
thee to hear it with thine ears?

3 And say unto the Ammonites,
Hear the word of the Lord God; Thus
saith the Lord God; Because thou
saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary,
when it was profaned; and against
the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;
4 Behold, therefore I will deliver
thee to the men of the east for a
possession, and they shall set their
palaces in thee, and make their
dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy
fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.
5 And I will make a Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites
a couchingplace for flocks: and ye
shall know that I am the Lord.
6 For thus saith the Lord God;
Because thou hast clapped thine
hands, and stamped with the feet,
and rejoiced in heart with all thy
a 
despite against the land of Israel;
7 Behold, therefore I will stretch
out mine hand upon thee, and will
deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from
the people, and I will cause thee to
perish out of the countries: I will
destroy thee; and thou shalt know
that I am the Lord.
8 ¶ Thus saith the Lord God; Because that a Moab and b Seir do say,
Behold, the house of Judah is like
unto all the c heathen;
9 Therefore, behold, I will open
the side of Moab from the cities,
from his cities which are on his
frontiers, the glory of the country,
a 
Beth-jeshimoth, b Baal-meon, and
Kiriathaim,
10 Unto the men of the east with
the Ammonites, and will give them
in possession, that the Ammonites
may not be remembered among
the nations.

12 ¶ Thus saith the Lord God; Because that a Edom hath dealt against
the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended,
and revenged himself upon them;
13 Therefore thus saith the Lord
God; I will also stretch out mine
hand upon a Edom, and will cut
off man and beast from it; and I
will make it b desolate from Teman;
and they of Dedan shall fall by the
sword.
14 And I will lay my vengeance
upon a Edom by the hand of my
people Israel: and they shall do
in Edom according to mine anger
and according to my fury; and they
shall know my vengeance, saith the
Lord God.
15 ¶ Thus saith the Lord God; Because the a Philistines have dealt by
revenge, and have taken vengeance
with a despiteful heart, to destroy
it for the old hatred;
16 Therefore thus saith the Lord
God; Behold, I will stretch out mine
hand upon the Philistines, and I will
cut off the Cherethims, and destroy
the remnant of the a sea coast.
17 And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I
am the Lord, when I shall lay my
vengeance upon them.

she is broken that was the gates of
the people: she is turned unto me:
I shall be replenished, now she is
laid waste:
3 Therefore thus saith the Lord
God; Behold, I am against thee, O
Tyrus, and will cause many nations
to come up a against thee, as the sea
causeth his waves to come up.
4 And they shall destroy the walls
of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from
her, and make her like the a top of
a rock.
5 It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea:
for I have spoken it, saith the Lord
God: and it shall become a spoil to
the nations.
6 And her daughters which are
in the field shall be slain by the
sword; and they shall a know that I
am the Lord.
7 ¶ For thus saith the Lord God;
Behold, I will bring upon a Tyrus
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a
king of kings, from the b north, with
horses, and with chariots, and with
horsemen, and companies, and
much people.
8 He shall slay with the sword thy
daughters in the field: and he shall
make a fort against thee, and cast
a mount against thee, and lift up
the a buckler against thee.
9 And he shall set a engines of war
against thy walls, and with his axes
he shall break down thy towers.
10 By reason of the abundance
of his horses their dust shall cover
thee: thy walls shall shake at the
noise of the horsemen, and of the
wheels, and of the chariots, when
he shall enter into thy gates, as men
enter into a city wherein is made
a breach.
11 With the hoofs of his horses
shall he tread down all thy streets:
he shall slay thy people by the

shall go down to the ground.
12 And they shall make a spoil
of thy riches, and make a prey of
thy merchandise: and they shall
break down thy walls, and destroy
thy pleasant houses: and they shall
lay thy stones and thy timber and
thy dust in the midst of the water.
13 And I will cause the noise of thy
songs to cease; and the sound of
thy harps shall be no more heard.
14 And I will make thee like the
a 
top of a rock: thou shalt be a place
to spread nets upon; thou shalt be
built no more: for I the Lord have
spoken it, saith the Lord God.
15 ¶ Thus saith the Lord God to
Tyrus; Shall not the a isles b shake
at the sound of thy fall, when the
wounded cry, when the slaughter
is made in the midst of thee?
16 Then all the a princes of the sea
shall come down from their thrones,
and lay away their robes, and put
off their broidered garments: they
shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground,
and shall tremble at every moment,
and be astonished at thee.
17 And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee,
How art thou destroyed, that wast
inhabited of seafaring men, the
renowned city, which wast a strong
in the sea, she and her inhabitants,
which cause their terror to be on all
that haunt it!
18 Now shall the a isles tremble
in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles
that are in the sea shall be troubled
at thy departure.
19 For thus saith the Lord God;
When I shall make thee a a desolate
city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the
b 
deep upon thee, and great waters
shall cover thee;

Ezekiel laments the fall of Tyre and
the loss of her riches and commerce.
The word of the Lord came again
unto me, saying,
2 Now, thou son of man, take up
a a lamentation for Tyrus;
3 And say unto Tyrus, O thou that
art situate at the entry of the sea,
which art a merchant of the people
for many isles, Thus saith the Lord
God; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I am
of perfect a beauty.
4 Thy borders are in the midst of
the seas, thy builders have perfected
thy beauty.
5 They have made all thy ship
boards of fir trees of a Senir: they
have taken cedars from Lebanon to
make masts for thee.
6 Of the a oaks of Bashan have they
made thine oars; the company of the
Ashurites have made thy benches
of ivory, brought out of the isles of
Chittim.
7 Fine linen with broidered work
from Egypt was that which thou
spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue
and purple from the isles of a Eli­

army were upon thy walls round
about, and the Gammadims were
in thy towers: they hanged their
shields upon thy walls round about;
they have made thy beauty perfect.
12 a Tarshish was thy merchant by
reason of the multitude of all kind
of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and
lead, they traded in thy fairs.

thy making: they occupied in thy
fairs with emeralds, purple, and
broidered work, and fine linen, and

they were thy merchants: they traded
in thy market wheat of b Minnith,

5 By thy great a wisdom and by thy
traffick hast thou increased thy
riches, and thine heart is lifted up
because of thy riches:
6 Therefore thus saith the Lord
God; Because thou hast set thine
heart as the heart of God;
7 Behold, therefore I will bring
strangers upon thee, the terrible
of the nations: and they shall draw
their a swords against the beauty
of thy wisdom, and they shall defile
thy brightness.
8 They shall bring thee down to the
pit, and thou shalt die the deaths
of them that are slain in the midst
of the seas.
9 Wilt thou yet say before him
that slayeth thee, I am God? but
thou shalt be a man, and no God, in
the hand of him that slayeth thee.
10 Thou shalt die the deaths of
the uncircumcised by the hand of
strangers: for I have spoken it, saith
the Lord God.
11 ¶ Moreover the word of the
Lord came unto me, saying,
12 Son of man, take up a a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and
say unto him, Thus saith the Lord
God; Thou sealest up the sum, full
of wisdom, and perfect in b beauty.
13 Thou hast been in a Eden the
garden of God; every precious stone
was thy covering, the sardius, topaz,
and the diamond, the beryl, the
onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire,
the emerald, and the carbuncle,
and gold: the workmanship of thy
tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou
wast created.
14 Thou art the anointed a cherub
that covereth; and I have set thee
so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up

of fire.

16 By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst

sinned: therefore I will cast thee
as profane out of the mountain of
God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the
stones of fire.
17 Thine a heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of
thy brightness: I will cast thee to
the ground, I will lay thee before
kings, that they may behold thee.
18 Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy a traffick; therefore will I bring forth a
fire from the midst of thee, it shall
devour thee, and I will bring thee
to ashes upon the earth in the sight
of all them that behold thee.
19 All they that know thee among
the people shall be astonished at
thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never
shalt thou be any more.

I have given thee for meat to the
beasts of the field and to the fowls

6 And all the inhabitants of Egypt
shall know that I am the Lord, because they have been a staff of a reed
to the house of Israel.
7 When they took hold of thee by
thy hand, thou didst break, and
rend all their shoulder: and when
they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to
a 
be at a stand.
8 ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord
God; Behold, I will bring a sword
upon thee, and cut off man and
beast out of thee.
9 And the land of Egypt shall be
desolate and waste; and they shall
know that I am the Lord: because
he hath said, The river is mine, and
I have made it.
10 Behold, therefore I am against
thee, and against thy rivers, and I
will make the land of Egypt utterly
waste and desolate, a from the tower
of Syene even unto the border of
b 
Ethiopia.
11 No foot of man shall pass
through it, nor foot of beast shall
pass through it, neither shall it be

12 And I will make the land of
Egypt desolate in the midst of the
countries that are desolate, and her
cities among the cities that are laid
waste shall be desolate forty years:
and I will a scatter the Egyptians

and they shall be there a c base

15 It shall be the basest of the

for I will diminish them, that they
shall no more rule over the nations.
16 And it shall be no more the

which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look

17 ¶ And it came to pass in the
seven and twentieth year, in the first
month, in the first day of the month,
the word of the Lord came unto
me, saying,
18 Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar
king of Babylon caused his army
to serve a great service against
a 
Tyrus: every head was made bald,
and every shoulder was peeled: yet
had he no wages, nor his army, for
Tyrus, for the service that he had
served against it:
19 Therefore thus saith the Lord
God; Behold, I will give the land of

Egypt and its helpers will be made desolate by Babylon.
The word of the Lord came again
unto me, saying,

Thus saith the Lord God; Howl ye,
a 
Woe worth the day!
3 For the day is near, even the day
of the Lord is near, a a cloudy day;
it shall be the time of the heathen.
4 And the sword shall come upon
Egypt, and great pain shall be in
a 
Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall
in Egypt, and they shall take away
her multitude, and her foundations
shall be broken down.
5 a Ethiopia, and b Libya, and c Lydia, and all the mingled people, and
Chub, and the men of the land that
is in league, shall fall with them by
the sword.
6 Thus saith the Lord; They also
that uphold Egypt shall fall; and
the pride of her power shall come
down: a from the tower of Syene
shall they fall in it by the sword,
saith the Lord God.
7 And they shall be desolate in the
midst of the countries that are deso­
late, and her cities shall be in the
midst of the cities that are wasted.
8 And they shall know that I am
the Lord, when I have set a fire in
Egypt, and when all her helpers
shall be destroyed.
9 In that day shall messengers go
forth from me in ships to make the
careless a Ethiopians afraid, and
great pain shall come upon them,
as in the day of Egypt: for, lo, it
cometh.
10 Thus saith the Lord God; I will
also make the multitude of Egypt
to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.

the terrible of the nations, shall
be brought to destroy the land:
and they shall draw their a swords
against Egypt, and fill the land
with the slain.
12 And I will make the rivers a dry,
and sell the land into the hand of
the wicked: and I will make the
land waste, and all that is therein,
by the hand of strangers: I the Lord
have spoken it.
13 Thus saith the Lord God; I will
also destroy the a idols, and I will
cause their images to cease out of
b 
Noph; and there shall be no more
a c prince of the land of Egypt: and I
will put a fear in the land of Egypt.
14 And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and
will execute judgments in a No.
15 And I will pour my fury upon
Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I
will cut off the multitude of No.
16 And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin
shall have great pain, and No shall
be rent asunder, and Noph shall have
distresses daily.
17 The young men of Aven and of
Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword: and
these cities shall go into captivity.
18 At Tehaphnehes also the day
shall be darkened, when I shall
break there the yokes of Egypt:
and the pomp of her strength shall
cease in her: as for her, a cloud
shall cover her, and her daughters
shall go into captivity.
19 Thus will I execute judgments
in Egypt: and they shall know that
I am the Lord.
20 ¶ And it came to pass in the
eleventh year, in the first month, in
the seventh day of the month, that
the word of the Lord came unto
me, saying,
21 Son of man, I have broken the
arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and,
lo, it shall not be bound up to be
healed, to put a a roller to bind it,
to make it strong to hold the sword.

25 But I will strengthen the arms

Pharaoh’s glory and fall are compared
to that of the Assyrians.
And it came to pass in the eleventh
year, in the third month, in the first
day of the month, that the word of
the Lord came unto me, saying,
2 Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh
king of a Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy
greatness?
3 ¶ Behold, the a Assyrian was a b cedar in Lebanon with fair branches,
and with a shadowing shroud, and
of an high stature; and his top was
among the thick boughs.
4 The waters made him great, the
deep set him up on high with her
rivers running round about his
plants, and sent out her little rivers
unto all the trees of the field.

5 Therefore his height was exalted
above all the trees of the field, and
his boughs were multiplied, and his
branches became long because of
the multitude of waters, when he
shot forth.
6 All the fowls of heaven made
their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts
of the field bring forth their young,
and under his shadow dwelt all
great nations.
7 Thus was he fair in his greatness,
in the length of his branches: for
his root was by great waters.
8 The cedars in the garden of God
could not hide him: the fir trees
were not like his boughs, and the
chestnut trees were not like his
branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in
his beauty.
9 I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all
the trees of a Eden, that were in the
garden of God, envied him.
10 ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord
God; Because thou hast lifted up
thyself in height, and he hath shot
up his top among the thick boughs,
and his a heart is lifted up in his
height;
11 I have therefore delivered him
into the hand of the mighty one of
the heathen; he shall surely deal
with him: I have driven him out
for his wickedness.
12 And strangers, the terrible of
the nations, have cut him off, and
have left him: upon the mountains
and in all the valleys his branches
are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land;
and all the people of the earth are
gone down from his shadow, and
have left him.
13 Upon his ruin shall all the fowls
of the heaven remain, and all the
beasts of the field shall be upon
his branches:
14 To the end that none of all the
trees by the waters exalt themselves
	9	a	 Ezek. 28:13.
	10	a	 Isa. 14:13 (13–15);
Ezek. 28:17.

for their height, neither shoot up
their top among the thick boughs,
neither their trees stand up in their
height, all that drink water: for
they are all delivered unto death,
to a the nether parts of the earth, in
the midst of the children of men,
with them that go down to the pit.
15 Thus saith the Lord God; In the
day when he went down to the grave
I caused a mourning: I covered the
deep for him, and I restrained the
floods thereof, and the great waters
were stayed: and I caused Lebanon
to mourn for him, and all the trees
of the field fainted for him.
16 I made the nations to shake at
the sound of his fall, when I cast
him down to hell with them that
descend into the pit: and all the
trees of Eden, the choice and best
of Lebanon, all that drink water,
shall be comforted in the nether
parts of the earth.
17 They also went down into hell
with him unto them that be slain
with the sword; and they that were
his arm, that dwelt under his shadow
in the midst of the heathen.
18 ¶ To whom art thou thus like
in glory and in greatness among
the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou
be brought down with the trees of
Eden unto the nether parts of the
earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of
the uncircumcised with them that
be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith
the Lord God.

forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and
c 
fouledst their rivers.
3 Thus saith the Lord God; I will
therefore a spread out my net over
thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up
in my net.
4 Then will I leave thee upon the
land, I will cast thee forth upon
the open field, and will cause all
the fowls of the heaven to remain
upon thee, and I will fill the beasts
of the whole earth with thee.
5 And I will lay thy flesh upon
the mountains, and fill the valleys
with thy a height.
6 a I will also water with thy blood
the land wherein thou swimmest,
even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee.
7 And when I shall a put thee out,
I will b cover the heaven, and make
the c stars thereof dark; I will cover
the sun with a cloud, and the moon
shall not give her light.
8 All the bright lights of heaven
will I make dark over thee, and set
darkness upon thy land, saith the
Lord God.
9 I will also a vex the hearts of
many people, when I shall bring
thy destruction among the nations,
into the countries which thou hast
not known.
10 Yea, I will make many people
amazed at thee, and their kings shall
be horribly afraid for thee, when
I shall brandish my sword before
them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own
life, in the day of thy fall.
11 ¶ For thus saith the Lord God;
The sword of the king of Babylon
shall come upon thee.
12 By the swords of the mighty
will I cause thy multitude to fall,

14 Then will I make their waters
deep, and cause their rivers to run

15 When I shall make the land of
Egypt desolate, and the country
shall be destitute of that whereof
it was full, when I shall smite all

16 This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the

twelfth year, in the fifteenth day
of the month, that the word of the
Lord came unto me, saying,

24 There is a Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all

4 Then whosoever heareth the
sound of the trumpet, and taketh
not warning; if the sword come, and
take him away, his a blood shall be
upon his b own head.
5 He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood
shall be upon him. But he that tak­
eth warning shall deliver his soul.
6 But if the watchman see the
sword come, and blow not the
trumpet, and the people be not

take any person from among them,
he is taken away in his iniquity;
but his blood will I b require at the

7 ¶ So thou, O son of man, I have
set thee a a watchman unto the house
of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear
the word at my mouth, and warn
them from me.
8 When I say unto the wicked, O
wicked man, thou shalt surely die;
if thou dost not speak to warn the
wicked from his way, that wicked
man shall die in his iniquity; but his
blood will I require at thine hand.
9 Nevertheless, if thou a warn the
wicked of his way to turn from it;
if he do not turn from his way, he
shall die in his b iniquity; but thou
hast delivered thy soul.
10 Therefore, O thou son of man,
speak unto the house of Israel; Thus
ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and
we pine away in them, how should
we then live?
11 Say unto them, As I live, saith
the Lord God, I have no a pleasure
in the b death of the wicked; but
that the wicked turn from his way
and live: turn ye, turn ye from your
evil ways; for why will ye c die, O
house of Israel?
12 Therefore, thou son of man,
say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the
day of his a transgression: as for the
wickedness of the wicked, he shall
not fall thereby in the day that he
turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to
live for his righteousness in the day
that he sinneth.

wicked, Thou shalt surely a die; if
he b turn from his sin, and do that
which is lawful and right;
15 If the wicked a  restore the

pledge, give again that he had
robbed, walk in the c statutes of life,
without committing iniquity; he
shall surely live, he shall not die.
16 None of his a sins that he hath
committed shall be mentioned unto
him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.
17 ¶ Yet the children of thy people say, The a way of the Lord is not
b 
equal: but as for them, their way
is not c equal.
18 When the righteous a turneth
from his b righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die
thereby.
19 But if the wicked turn from his
wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.

Lord is not equal. O ye house of
Israel, I will a judge you every one
after his ways.

23 Then the word of the Lord

those a wastes of the land of Israel
speak, saying, Abraham was one,
and he inherited the land: but we
are many; the land is given us for
inheritance.
25 Wherefore say unto them, Thus
saith the Lord God; Ye eat with the

your idols, and shed blood: and shall
ye possess the land?
26 Ye a stand upon your sword, ye
work abomination, and ye defile

shall ye possess the land?
27 Say thou thus unto them, Thus
saith the Lord God; As I live, surely
they that are in the wastes shall fall
by the a sword, and him that is in the
open field will I give to the beasts
to be devoured, and they that be in
the forts and in the caves shall die

shall cease; and the mountains of
Israel shall be desolate, that none

The Lord reproves those shepherds who
do not feed the flock—In the last days,

And the word of the Lord came
unto me, saying,
2 Son of man, prophesy against
the shepherds of Israel, prophesy,
and say unto them, Thus saith the
Lord God unto the shepherds; Woe
be to the a shepherds of Israel that
do feed themselves! should not the

neither have ye brought again that
which was driven away, neither have
ye sought that which was lost; but

ye ruled them.

upon all the face of the earth, and
none did search or seek after them.
7 ¶ Therefore, ye shepherds, hear
the word of the Lord;
8 As I live, saith the Lord God,
surely because my flock became a
prey, and my flock became meat
to every beast of the field, because
there was no shepherd, neither did
my shepherds search for my flock,
but the a shepherds b fed themselves,
and fed not my flock;
9 Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear
the word of the Lord;
10 Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against the shepherds;
and I will a require my flock at their
hand, and cause them to b cease from
feeding the flock; neither shall the
shepherds feed themselves any
more; for I will deliver my flock
from their mouth, that they may
not be meat for them.
11 ¶ For thus saith the Lord God;
Behold, I, even I, will both a search
my sheep, and seek them out.
12 As a a shepherd seeketh out his
flock in the day that he is among
his sheep that are scattered; so will
I b seek out my c sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where
they have been d scattered in the
e 
cloudy and f dark day.
13 And I will a bring them out from
the people, and b gather them from
the countries, and will bring them
to their own c land, and feed them
upon the mountains of Israel by
the rivers, and in all the inhabited
places of the country.
14 I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains
of Israel shall their fold be: there

shall they a lie in a good fold, and in
a fat pasture shall they feed upon
the mountains of Israel.
15 I will feed my flock, and I will
cause them to lie down, saith the
Lord God.
16 I will seek that which was
a 
lost, and bring again that which
was driven away, and will bind
up that which was broken, and will
strengthen that which was b sick: but
I will destroy the c fat and the strong;
I will feed them with d judgment.
17 And as for you, O my a flock,
thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I
b 
judge c between cattle and cattle,
between the rams and the he goats.
18 Seemeth it a small thing unto you
to have eaten up the good pasture,
but ye must tread down with your
feet the residue of your pastures?
and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must a foul the residue
with your feet?
19 And as for my flock, they eat
that which ye have a trodden with
your feet; and they drink that which
ye have fouled with your feet.
20 ¶ Therefore thus saith the Lord
God unto them; Behold, I, even I, will
judge between the fat cattle and
between the lean cattle.
21 Because ye have thrust with side
and with shoulder, and pushed all
the diseased with your horns, till
ye have scattered them abroad;
22 Therefore will I save my a flock,
and they shall no more be a prey;
and I will judge between cattle and
cattle.

of the heathen any more.

Judgment will fall upon Mount Seir and
all Idumea for their hatred of Israel.
Moreover the word of the Lord
came unto me, saying,
2 Son of man, set thy a face against
mount b Seir, and prophesy against it,
3 And say unto it, Thus saith the
Lord God; Behold, O mount Seir, I
am against thee, and I will stretch
out mine hand against thee, and I
will make thee most desolate.
4 I will lay thy cities waste, and
thou shalt be desolate, and thou
shalt know that I am the Lord.
5 Because thou hast had a perpetual a hatred, and hast shed the
blood of the children of Israel by
the force of the sword in the time
of their calamity, in the time that
their iniquity had an end:
6 Therefore, as I live, saith the
Lord God, I will prepare thee unto
blood, and blood shall pursue thee:
a 
sith thou hast not hated blood, even
blood shall pursue thee.
7 Thus will I make mount Seir
most desolate, and cut off from it
him that passeth out and him that
returneth.
8 And I will fill his mountains with
his a slain men: in thy hills, and in
thy valleys, and in all thy b rivers,
shall they fall that are slain with
the sword.
9 I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy a cities shall not
return: and ye shall know that I am
the Lord.
10 Because thou hast said, These
two nations and these two countries
shall be mine, and we will a possess
it; whereas the Lord was there:

11 Therefore, as I live, saith the
Lord God, I will even do according to
thine anger, and according to thine
envy which thou hast used out of
thy hatred against them; and I will
make myself known among them,
when I have judged thee.
12 And thou shalt know that I am
the Lord, and that I have heard all
thy a blasphemies which thou hast
spoken against the mountains of
Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.
13 Thus with your mouth ye have
a 
boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I
have heard them.
14 Thus saith the Lord God; When
the whole earth rejoiceth, I will
make thee desolate.
15 As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I a do
unto thee: thou shalt be desolate,
O mount Seir, and all b Idumea, even
all of it: and they shall know that I
am the Lord.

In the last days, all the house of Israel

the residue of the heathen, and ye
are taken up in the lips of talkers,
and are an infamy of the people:
4 Therefore, ye mountains of
Israel, hear the word of the Lord
God; Thus saith the Lord God to the
mountains, and to the hills, to
the a rivers, and to the valleys, to the
desolate b wastes, and to the cities
that are forsaken, which became a
prey and c derision to the residue of
the heathen that are round about;
5 Therefore thus saith the Lord
God; Surely in the fire of my a jealousy have I spoken against the resi­
due of the heathen, and against all
b 
Idumea, which have appointed
my land into their possession with
the joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for
a prey.
6 Prophesy therefore concerning
the land of Israel, and say unto the
mountains, and to the hills, to the
rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith
the Lord God; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury,
because ye have borne the a shame
of the heathen:
7 Therefore thus saith the Lord
God; I have lifted up mine hand,
Surely the heathen that are about
you, they shall bear their shame.
8 ¶ But ye, O mountains of Israel,
ye shall shoot forth your a branches,
and yield your fruit to my people of
Israel; for they are b at hand to come.
9 For, behold, I am for you, and I
will a turn unto you, and ye shall
be tilled and sown:
10 And I will multiply men upon
you, all the house of Israel, even

builded:

12 Yea, I will cause men to walk
upon you, even my people Israel; and
they shall a possess thee, and thou
shalt be their inheritance, and thou
shalt no more henceforth bereave
them of men.
13 Thus saith the Lord God; Because they say unto you, Thou land
devourest up men, and hast a bereaved thy nations;
14 Therefore thou shalt devour
men no more, neither bereave thy
nations any more, saith the Lord
God.
15 Neither will I cause men to hear
in thee the shame of the heathen
any more, neither shalt thou bear
the reproach of the people any
more, neither shalt thou cause thy
nations to fall any more, saith the
Lord God.
16 ¶ Moreover the word of the
Lord came unto me, saying,
17 Son of man, when the house
of Israel dwelt in their own land,
they a defiled it by their own way
and by their doings: their way was
before me as the b uncleanness of a
removed woman.
18 Wherefore I poured my fury
upon them for the blood that they
had a shed upon the land, and for
their b idols wherewith they had c polluted it:
19 And I a scattered them among
the b heathen, and they were c dispersed through the countries:

they said to them, These are the

21 ¶ But I had a pity for mine holy
b 
name, which the house of Israel
had profaned among the heathen,
whither they went.
22 Therefore say unto the house
of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God; I
do not this for your a sakes, O house
of Israel, but for mine holy b name’s
sake, which ye have profaned among
the heathen, whither ye went.
23 And I will sanctify my great
name, which was profaned among
the a heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the
heathen shall know that I am the
Lord, saith the Lord God, when I
shall be b sanctified in you before
their eyes.
24 For I will take you from among
the heathen, and a gather you out
of all countries, and will bring you
into your own b land.
25 ¶ Then will I a sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean:
from all your b filthiness, and from
all your c idols, will I cleanse you.
26 A a new b heart also will I c give
you, and a new d spirit will I put
within you: and I will take away

and I will give you an heart of flesh.
27 And I will put my a spirit within
you, and cause you to walk in my
statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.

that I gave to your fathers; and ye
shall be my people, and I will be

lay no famine upon you.
30 And I will multiply the fruit
of the tree, and the increase of the

31 Then shall ye a  remember

from all your iniquities I will also

be b tilled, whereas it lay desolate

Ezekiel is shown the valley of dry
bones—Israel will inherit the land in
the Resurrection—The stick of Judah
(the Bible) and the stick of Joseph (the
Book of Mormon) will become one in the
Lord’s hand—The children of Israel will
be gathered and cleansed—David (the
Messiah) will reign over them—They will
receive the everlasting gospel covenant.
The a hand of the Lord was upon me,
and b carried me out in the c spirit
of the Lord, and set me down in
the midst of the valley which was
full of bones,
2 And caused me to pass by them
round about: and, behold, there were
very many in the open valley; and,
lo, they were very dry.
3 And he said unto me, Son of man,
can these bones a live? And I answered, O Lord God, thou knowest.
4 Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto
them, O ye dry bones, hear the word
of the Lord.
5 Thus saith the Lord God unto
these bones; Behold, I will cause
a 
breath to enter into you, and ye
shall live:
6 And I will lay sinews upon you,
and will bring up flesh upon you,
and cover you with skin, and put
breath in you, and ye shall live; and
ye shall know that I am the Lord.
7 So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there
was a noise, and behold a shaking,
and the bones came together, a bone
to his bone.
8 And when I beheld, lo, the sinews
and the flesh came up upon them,
and the skin covered them above:
but there was no breath in them.
9 Then said he unto me, Prophesy
unto the a wind, prophesy, son of
man, and say to the wind, Thus saith

the Lord God; Come from the four

these slain, that they may live.
10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the a breath came
into them, and they lived, and stood
up upon their feet, an exceeding
great army.
11 ¶ Then he said unto me, Son
of man, these bones are the whole
house of Israel: behold, they say,
Our bones are dried, and our hope
is a lost: we are cut off for our parts.
12 Therefore prophesy and say
unto them, Thus saith the Lord
God; Behold, O my people, I will
open your a graves, and cause you
to b come up out of your graves,
and c bring you into the d land of
Israel.
13 And ye shall know that I am
the Lord, when I have opened your

14 And shall put my a spirit in you,
and ye shall live, and I shall place
you in your own land: then shall ye
know that I the Lord have spoken
it, and performed it, saith the Lord.

again unto me, saying,

thee one a stick, and b write upon it,
For c Judah, and for the children of
Israel his companions: then take

13 Sheba, and Dedan, and the

unto thee, Art thou come to take a

and goods, to take a great spoil?
14 ¶ Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith
the Lord God; In that day when
my people of Israel dwelleth safely,
shalt thou not know it?
15 And thou shalt come from thy
place out of the a north parts, thou,
and many people with thee, all of
them riding upon horses, a great
company, and a mighty army:
16 And thou shalt come up a against
my people of Israel, as a cloud to
cover the land; it shall be in the

latter days, and I will bring thee
against my land, that the c heathen
may know me, when I shall be
sanctified d in thee, O Gog, before

17 Thus saith the Lord God; Art
thou he of whom I have spoken in

those days many years that I would
bring thee against them?
18 And it shall come to pass at the

Lord God, that my a fury shall come

him throughout all my mountains,
saith the Lord God: every man’s
sword shall be against his a brother.
22 And I will a plead against him
with b pestilence and with blood; and
I will rain upon him, and upon his

Lord God.
6 And I will send a a fire on Magog,

7 So will I make my holy name
a 
known in the midst of my people
Israel; and I will not let them b pollute my holy name any more: and

the Lord, the Holy One in Israel.
8 ¶ Behold, it is come, and it is
done, saith the Lord God; this is the
day whereof I have spoken.
9 And they that dwell in the cities
of Israel shall go forth, and shall
set on fire and burn the weapons,
both the shields and the bucklers,
the bows and the arrows, and the
handstaves, and the spears, and
they shall burn them with fire
seven years:
10 So that they shall take no wood
out of the field, neither cut down
any out of the forests; for they shall
burn the weapons with fire: and
they shall a spoil those that spoiled
them, and rob those that robbed
them, saith the Lord God.

that day, that I will give unto Gog a
place there of graves in Israel, the
valley of the a passengers on the east
of the sea: and it shall stop the
noses of the passengers: and there
shall they bury Gog and all his
multitude: and they shall call it

that they may cleanse the land.

I do sacrifice for you, even a great

In the five and twentieth year of our
captivity, in the beginning of the
year, in the tenth day of the month,
in the fourteenth year after that the
city was smitten, in the selfsame day
the a hand of the Lord was upon me,
and brought me thither.
2 In the a visions of God brought
he me into the land of Israel, and
set me upon a very high b mountain,
by which was as the frame of a city
on the south.
3 And he brought me thither, and,
behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance
of a brass, with a line of flax in his
hand, and a b measuring c reed; and
he stood in the gate.
4 And the man said unto me, Son
of man, behold with thine eyes,
and hear with thine ears, and set
thine a heart upon all that I shall
shew thee; for to the intent that I
might shew them unto thee art thou
brought hither: b declare all that
thou seest to the house of Israel.
5 And behold a wall on the outside
of the a house round about, and in
the man’s hand a measuring reed of
six b cubits long c by the cubit and an
hand breadth: so he d measured the
e 
breadth of the building, one reed;
and the height, one reed.
6 ¶ Then came he unto the a gate
which b looketh toward the east,
and went up the stairs thereof, and
measured the threshold of the gate,
which was one reed broad; and the
other threshold of the gate, which was
one reed broad.

7 And every little chamber was one
reed long, and one reed broad; and
between the little chambers were
five cubits; and the threshold of
the gate by the porch of the gate
within was one reed.
8 He measured also the porch of
the gate within, one reed.
9 Then measured he the porch of
the gate, eight cubits; and the posts
thereof, two cubits; and the porch
of the gate was inward.
10 And the little chambers of the
gate eastward were three on this
side, and three on that side; they
three were of one measure: and the
posts had one measure on this side
and on that side.
11 And he measured the breadth
of the entry of the gate, ten cubits;
and the a length of the gate, thirteen cubits.
12 The space also before the little
chambers was one cubit on this side,
and the space was one cubit on that
side: and the little chambers were
six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.
13 He measured then the gate
from the roof of one little chamber
to the roof of another: the breadth
was five and twenty cubits, door
against door.
14 He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of
the court round about the gate.
15 And from the a face of the gate
of the entrance unto the face of
the porch of the inner gate were
fifty cubits.
16 And there were narrow windows
to the little chambers, and to their
posts within the gate round about,
and likewise to the arches: and windows were round about inward: and
upon each post were a palm trees.
17 Then brought he me into the
outward court, and, lo, there were
a 
chambers, and a pavement made
for the court round about: thirty
chambers b were upon the pavement.

of the gates over against the length
of the gates was the lower pavement.
19 Then he measured the breadth
from the forefront of the lower
gate unto the forefront of the inner
court without, an hundred cubits
eastward and northward.
20 ¶ And the gate of the a outward
court that looked toward the b north,
he measured the length thereof,
and the breadth thereof.
21 And the little chambers thereof
were three on this side and three
on that side; and the posts thereof
and the arches thereof were after
the measure of the first gate: the
length thereof was fifty cubits, and
the breadth five and twenty cubits.
22 And their windows, and their
arches, and their palm trees, were
after the measure of the gate that
looketh toward the east; and they
went up unto it by seven steps; and
the arches thereof were before them.
23 And the gate of the inner court
was a over against the gate toward
the north, and toward the east; and
he measured from gate to gate an
hundred cubits.
24 ¶ After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate
toward the south: and he measured
the posts thereof and the arches
thereof according to these measures.
25 And there were windows in it and
in the arches thereof round about,
like those windows: the length was
fifty cubits, and the breadth five
and twenty cubits.
26 And there were seven steps to
go up to it, and the arches thereof
were before them: and it had palm
trees, one on this side, and another
on that side, upon the posts thereof.
27 And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he
measured from gate to gate toward
the south an hundred cubits.
28 And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he
measured the south gate according

gate, were two tables; and on the
other side, which was at the porch
of the gate, were two tables.
41 Four tables were on this side, and
four tables on that side, by the side
of the gate; eight tables, whereupon
they slew their sacrifices.
42 And the four tables were of
hewn stone for the burnt offering,
of a cubit and an half long, and a
cubit and an half broad, and one
cubit high: whereupon also they
laid the instruments wherewith
they slew the burnt offering and
the sacrifice.
43 And within were hooks, an hand
broad, fastened round about: and
upon the tables was the flesh of
the offering.
44 ¶ And a without the inner gate
were the chambers of the b singers
in the inner court, which was at the
side of the north gate; and their
prospect was toward the south: one
at the side of the east gate having
the prospect toward the north.
45 And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the
south, is for the priests, the a keepers
of the charge of the house.
46 And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the
a 
priests, the keepers of the b charge
of the altar: these are the sons of
c 
Zadok among the sons of Levi,
which d come near to the Lord to
minister unto him.
47 So he measured the court, an
hundred cubits long, and an a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and
the altar that was before the house.
48 ¶ And he brought me to the
porch of the house, and measured

each post of the porch, five cubits
on this side, and five cubits on that
side: and the breadth of the gate
was three cubits on this side, and
three cubits on that side.
49 The length of the a porch was
twenty cubits, and the breadth
eleven cubits; and he brought me by
the steps whereby they went up
to it: and there were b pillars by the
posts, one on this side, and another
on that side.
Chapter 41
Ezekiel sees the inner temple and the
Holy of Holies, and he is shown their
form and size.
Afterward he brought me to the
temple, and measured the posts, six
cubits broad on the one side, and six
cubits broad on the other side, which
was the breadth of the tabernacle.
2 And the breadth of the a door was
ten cubits; and the sides of the door
were five cubits on the one side, and
five cubits on the other side: and he
measured the length thereof, forty
cubits: and the b breadth, twenty
cubits.
3 Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the
breadth of the door, seven cubits.
4 So he measured the length
thereof, twenty cubits; and the
breadth, twenty cubits, before the
temple: and he said unto me, This
is the most a holy place.
5 After he measured the wall of the
a 
house, six cubits; and the breadth
of every side chamber, four cubits,
round about the house on every side.
6 And the side chambers were three,
one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall
which was of the house for the side
a 
chambers round about, that they
might have hold, but they had not
hold in the wall of the house.

7 And there was an enlarging, and
a winding about still upward to
the side chambers: for the winding
about of the house went still upward
round about the house: therefore
the breadth of the house was still
upward, and so increased from the
lowest chamber to the highest by
the midst.
8 I saw also the height of the house
round about: the foundations of
the side chambers were a full reed
of six great a cubits.
9 The thickness of the wall, which
was for the side chamber without,
was five cubits: and that which was
left was the place of the side chambers that were within.
10 And between the a chambers
was the wideness of twenty cubits
round about the house on every side.
11 And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was
left, one door toward the north, and
another door toward the south: and
the breadth of the place that was
left was five cubits round about.
12 Now the building that was before the separate place at the end
toward the west was seventy cubits
broad; and the wall of the building
was five cubits thick round about,
and the length thereof ninety cubits.
13 So he measured the house, an
hundred cubits long; and the sepa­
rate place, and the building, with
the walls thereof, an a hundred cubits long;
14 Also the breadth of the face of
the house, and of the separate place
toward the east, an hundred cubits.
15 And he measured the length of
the building a over against the separate place which was behind it, and
the galleries thereof on the one side
and on the other side, an hundred
cubits, with the inner temple, and
the porches of the court;
16 The door posts, and the narrow
windows, and the a galleries round

about on their three stories, over
against the door, b ceiled with wood
round about, and from the ground
up to the windows, and the windows
were covered;
17 To that above the door, even
unto the inner house, and without,
and by all the wall round about
within and without, by measure.
18 And it was made with a cherubims and b palm trees, so that a
c 
palm tree was between a cherub
and a cherub; and every d cherub had
two faces;
19 So that the face of a man was
toward the palm tree on the one
side, and the face of a young lion
toward the palm tree on the other
side: it was made through all the
house round about.
20 From the ground unto above the
door were cherubims and palm trees
made, and on the wall of the temple.
21 The a posts of the temple were
squared, and the face of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one as
the appearance of the other.
22 The a altar of wood was three
cubits high, and the length thereof
two cubits; and the corners thereof,
and the length thereof, and the walls
thereof, were of wood: and he said
unto me, This is the b table that is
before the Lord.
23 And the temple and the sanctuary had two a doors.
24 And the doors had two leaves
apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves
for the one door, and two leaves for
the other door.
25 And there were made on them,
on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as were
made upon the walls; and there were
thick a planks upon the face of the
porch without.
26 And there were narrow windows
and palm trees on the one side and

on the other side, on the sides of
the porch, and upon the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.
Chapter 42
Ezekiel sees in the temple the chambers
for the priests.
Then he brought me forth into the
utter court, the way toward the
north: and he brought me into the
chamber that was b over against the
separate place, and which was before the building toward the north.
2 Before the length of an hundred
cubits was the north door, and the
breadth was fifty cubits.
3 a Over against the twenty cubits
which were for the inner court, and
over against the pavement which
was for the utter court, was b gallery
against gallery in three stories.
4 And before the a chambers was a
walk of ten cubits breadth inward,
a way of one cubit; and their doors
toward the north.
5 Now the upper chambers were
shorter: for the galleries were higher
than these, than the lower, and than
the middlemost of the building.
6 For they were in three stories, but
had not pillars as the pillars of the
courts: therefore the building was
straitened more than the lowest and
the middlemost from the ground.
7 And the wall that was without
over against the chambers, toward
the a utter court on the forepart of
the chambers, the length thereof
was fifty cubits.
8 For the length of the chambers
that were in the utter court was fifty
cubits: and, lo, before the temple
were an a hundred cubits.
9 And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side,
as one goeth into them from the
utter court.

10 The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward
the east, over against the separate
place, and over against the building.
11 And the way before them was
like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north,
as long as they, and as broad as they:
and all their goings out were both
according to their fashions, and
according to their doors.
12 And according to the doors of
the chambers that were toward the
south was a door in the head of the
way, even the way directly before
the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.
13 ¶ Then said he unto me, The
north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers,
where the a priests that approach
unto the Lord shall b eat the most
holy things: there shall they lay
the most holy things, and the c meat
offering, and the d sin offering, and
the trespass offering; for the place
is holy.
14 When the priests enter therein,
then shall they not go out of the
holy place into the utter court, but
there they shall lay their a garments
wherein they minister; for they are
holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those
things which are for the people.
15 Now when he had made an end
of measuring the inner house, he
brought me forth toward the a gate
whose prospect is toward the east,
and measured it round about.
16 He measured the east side with
the a measuring reed, five hundred
reeds, with the measuring reed
round about.

18 He measured the south side,
five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.
19 ¶ He turned about to the west
side, and measured five hundred
reeds with the measuring reed.
20 He a measured it by the four
sides: it had a wall round about,
b 
five hundred reeds long, and five
hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the
c 
profane place.
Chapter 43
The glory of God fills the temple—His
throne is there, and He promises to dwell
in the midst of Israel forever—Ezekiel
sees the altar and the ordinances of
the altar.
Afterward he brought me to the
gate, even the a gate that b looketh
toward the east:
2 And, behold, the a glory of the
God of Israel came from the way
of the b east: and his c voice was like
a noise of many d waters: and the
earth e shined with his f glory.
3 And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw,
even according to the vision that I
saw when I came to destroy the city:
and the visions were like the a vision
that I saw by the river Chebar; and
I fell upon my face.
4 And the glory of the Lord a came
into the b house by the way of the
gate c whose prospect is toward the
east.
5 So the a spirit took me up, and
brought me into the inner court;

filled the house.

me out of the house; and the man
stood by me.
7 ¶ And he said unto me, Son of
man, the place of my throne, and
the place of the soles of my a feet,
where I will dwell in the midst of
the children of Israel for ever, and
my holy name, shall the house of
Israel no more b defile, neither they,
nor their kings, by their whoredom,
nor by the carcases of their kings
in their high places.
8 In their setting of their threshold
by my thresholds, and their post by
my posts, and the wall between me
and them, they have even defiled
my holy a name by their abominations that they have committed:
wherefore I have consumed them
in mine anger.
9 Now let them put away their
whoredom, and the carcases of their
kings, far from me, and I will dwell
in the midst of them for ever.
10 ¶ Thou son of man, a shew the
house to the house of Israel, that
they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the
b 
pattern.
11 And if they be ashamed of all
that they have done, shew them the
form of the a house, and the fashion
thereof, and the goings out thereof,
and the comings in thereof, and all
the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms
thereof, and all the laws thereof:
and write it in their sight, that they
may keep the whole form thereof,
and all the b ordinances thereof, and
do them.
12 This is the law of the house;
Upon the top of the a mountain the
whole limit thereof round about
shall be most holy. Behold, this is
the law of the house.

even the bottom shall be a cubit, and
the breadth a cubit, and the border
thereof by the edge thereof round
about shall be a span: and this shall
be the higher place of the altar.
14 And from the bottom upon the
ground even to the lower a settle shall
be two cubits, and the breadth one

to the greater settle shall be four

15 So the altar shall be four cubits;
and from the altar and upward shall

to a sprinkle blood thereon.

the Lord God, a young c bullock for

thereof, and put it on the four horns

settle, and upon the border round

Then he brought me back the way
of the a gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east;
and it was shut.
2 Then said the Lord unto me;
This gate shall be shut, it shall not
be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the Lord, the
God of Israel, hath a entered in by
it, therefore it shall be shut.

of the a north gate before the house:
and I looked, and, behold, the b glory
of the Lord filled the house of the
Lord: and I c fell upon my face.
5 And the Lord said unto me, Son
of man, mark well, and behold with
thine eyes, and hear with thine ears
all that I say unto thee concerning
all the ordinances of the house of
the Lord, and all the laws thereof;
and mark well the entering in of
the house, with every going forth
of the sanctuary.
6 And thou shalt say to the a rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God; O ye
house of Israel, let it suffice you of
all your abominations,
7 In that ye have brought into my
sanctuary a strangers, uncircumcised
in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh,
to be in my sanctuary, to b pollute
it, even my house, when ye offer
my c bread, the d fat and the e blood,
and they have broken my f covenant
because of all your abominations.

9 ¶ Thus saith the Lord God; No
stranger, a uncircumcised in heart,
nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall
enter into my sanctuary, of any
stranger that is among the children
of Israel.
10 And the Levites that are gone
away far from me, when Israel went

burnt offering and the sacrifice for
the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them.
12 Because they ministered unto
them before their idols, and caused
the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up
mine hand against them, saith the
Lord God, and they shall bear their
iniquity.
13 And they shall not come a near
unto me, to do the office of a priest
unto me, nor to come near to any of

place: but they shall bear their

shame, and their abominations

of the charge of the house, for all

shall be done therein.

shall stand before me to offer unto

they shall not gird themselves with

19 And when they go forth into

shall b judge it according to my

person to defile themselves: but for
father, or for mother, or for son, or
for daughter, for brother, or for sister
that hath had no husband, they
may defile themselves.

26 And after he is a cleansed, they

27 And in the day that he goeth
into the sanctuary, unto the inner
court, to minister in the sanctuary,
he shall offer his sin offering, saith
the Lord God.
28 And a it shall be unto them
for an b inheritance: I am their inheritance: and ye shall give them
no possession in Israel: I am their

29 They shall eat the a meat offering, and the sin offering, and the

30 And the first of all the a firstfruits of all things, and every b oblation of all, of every sort of your

Portions of land will be provided for

sacrifices and oblations and keep their
feasts.
Moreover, when ye shall divide

shall offer an oblation unto the
Lord, an holy portion of the land:
the a length shall be the length of

measure the length of five and

4 The holy portion of the land shall
be for the a priests the ministers of

it shall be a place for their houses,

broad, and five and twenty thousand
long, over against the oblation of
the holy portion: it shall be for the
whole house of Israel.

prince on the one side and on the

portion, and of the possession of the
city, before the oblation of the holy
portion, and before the possession
of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length shall be over

away your b exactions from my people, saith the Lord God.
10 Ye shall have just balances, and
a just a ephah, and a just bath.
11 The ephah and the a bath shall
be of one measure, that the bath
may contain the tenth part of an
b 
homer, and the ephah the tenth part
of an homer: the measure thereof
shall be after the homer.
12 And the a shekel shall be twenty

twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall
be your maneh.
13 This is the a oblation that ye shall
offer; the sixth part of an ephah of
an homer of wheat, and ye shall
give the sixth part of an ephah of
an homer of barley:
14 Concerning the ordinance of
oil, the bath of oil, ye shall offer the
tenth part of a bath out of the cor,
which is an homer of ten baths; for
ten baths are an homer:
15 And one lamb out of the flock,
out of two hundred, out of the fat
pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for

16 All the people of the land shall
give this oblation for the prince in
Israel.
17 And it shall be the prince’s part
to give burnt offerings, and meat off­
erings, and a drink offerings, in the
feasts, and in the new b moons, and
in the sabbaths, in all c solemnities
of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the d sin offering, and the meat

days; b unleavened bread shall be

22 And upon that day shall the
prince prepare for himself and for
all the people of the land a bullock
for a sin offering.
23 And seven days of the feast he
shall prepare a burnt offering to
the Lord, seven bullocks and seven
rams without blemish daily the
seven days; and a a kid of the goats
daily for a sin offering.
24 And he shall prepare a meat
offering of an ephah for a bullock,
and an ephah for a ram, and an hin
of a oil for an ephah.
25 In the a seventh month, in the
fifteenth day of the month, shall
he do the like in the feast of the
seven days, according to the sin
offering, according to the burnt
offering, and according to the meat
offering, and according to the oil.

2 And the prince shall enter by the
way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the a post
of the gate, and the priests shall
prepare his burnt b offering and his
peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate:
then he shall go forth; but the gate
shall not be shut until the evening.
3 Likewise the people of the land
shall worship at the door of this gate
before the Lord in the sabbaths and
in the new moons.
4 And the burnt offering that the
prince shall offer unto the Lord in
the a sabbath day shall be six lambs
without blemish, and a ram without blemish.
5 And the meat offering shall be an
ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able
to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.
6 And in the day of the new moon
it shall be a young bullock without
blemish, and six lambs, and a ram:
they shall be without blemish.
7 And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an
ephah for a ram, and for the lambs
according as his hand shall attain
unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah.
8 And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the
porch of that gate, and he shall go
forth by the way thereof.
9 ¶ But when the people of the
land shall come before the Lord in
the solemn a feasts, he that entereth
in by the way of the north gate to
worship shall go out by the way of
the south gate; and he that entereth
by the way of the south gate shall go

he shall not return by the way of

be an ephah to a bullock, and an
ephah to a ram, and to the lambs
as he is able to give, and an hin of
oil to an ephah.
12 Now when the prince shall prepare a a voluntary burnt offering or
peace b offerings c voluntarily unto
the Lord, one shall then open him
the gate that looketh toward the
east, and he shall prepare his burnt
offering and his peace offerings, as
he did on the sabbath day: then he
shall go forth; and after his going
forth one shall shut the gate.
13 Thou shalt a daily prepare a burnt
offering unto the Lord of a lamb of

his sons, the inheritance thereof
shall be his sons’; it shall be their
possession by inheritance.
17 But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants,
then it shall be his to the year of

19 ¶ After he brought me through
the entry, which was at the side of
the gate, into the holy a chambers
of the priests, which looked toward
the north: and, behold, there was a
place on the two sides westward.
20 Then said he unto me, This is
the place where the priests shall
boil the a trespass offering and the
sin offering, where they shall b bake
the meat offering; that they bear
them not out into the utter court,
to sanctify the people.
21 Then he brought me forth into
the utter court, and caused me to
pass by the four corners of the court;
and, behold, in every corner of the
court there was a court.
22 In the four corners of the court
there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these
four corners were of one measure.
23 And there was a row of a building round about in them, round
about them four, and it was made
with boiling places under the rows
round about.
24 Then said he unto me, These
are the places of them that boil,
where the a ministers of the house
shall boil the sacrifice of the people.

2 Then brought he me out of the
way of the gate northward, and led
me about the way without unto the
utter a gate by the way that looketh
eastward; and, behold, there ran out
waters on the right side.
3 And when the man that had the
a 
line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the
waters; the waters were to the ankles.
4 Again he measured a thousand,
and brought me through the waters; the waters were to the knees.
Again he measured a thousand, and
brought me through; the waters
were to the loins.
5 Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could
not pass over: for the waters were
risen, waters to swim in, a river that
could not be passed over.
6 ¶ And he said unto me, Son of
man, hast thou seen this? Then he
brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.
7 Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were
very many trees on the one side
and on the other.
8 Then said he unto me, These
waters issue out toward the east
country, and go down into the desert, and go into the a sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the
b 
waters shall be healed.
9 And it shall come to pass, that
every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall
come, shall live: and there shall
be a very great multitude of fish,
because these waters shall come
thither: for they shall be healed;
and every thing shall live whither
the river cometh.

11 But the miry places thereof and

12 And by the river upon the bank
thereof, on this side and on that side,
shall grow all trees for meat, whose

bring forth new fruit according

This shall be the border, whereby ye
shall inherit the land according to
the twelve a tribes of Israel: b Joseph
shall have two portions.
14 And ye shall inherit it, one as
well as another: concerning the which
I a lifted up mine hand to give it
unto your fathers: and this land
shall fall unto you for b inheritance.
15 And this shall be the border of
the land toward the north side, from
the great sea, the way of Hethlon,
as men go to Zedad;
16 Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim,
which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath;

17 And the border from the sea
shall be Hazar-enan, the border of

is the north side.

from the land of Israel by Jordan,

which shall beget children among
you: and they shall be unto you as

born in the country among the

are left in the breadth over against
the five and twenty thousand, shall
be a a profane place for the city, for
dwelling, and for b suburbs: and the
city shall be in the midst thereof.
16 And these shall be the measures
thereof; the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the
south side four thousand and five
hundred, and on the east side four

17 And the suburbs of the city shall

east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty.
18 And the residue in length over
against the oblation of the holy portion shall be ten thousand eastward,
and ten thousand westward: and it
shall be over against the oblation
of the holy portion; and the increase
thereof shall be for food unto them
that serve the city.
19 And they that serve the city
shall serve it out of all the tribes
of Israel.
20 All the oblation shall be five
and twenty thousand by five and
twenty thousand: ye shall offer the
holy oblation foursquare, with the
possession of the city.
21 ¶ And the a residue shall be for
the prince, on the one side and on
the other of the holy oblation, and
of the possession of the city, over
against the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the
east border, and westward over
against the five and twenty thousand toward the west border,
over against the portions for the
prince: and it shall be the holy

22 Moreover from the possession of

which is the prince’s, between the
border of Judah and the border of
Benjamin, shall be for the prince.
23 As for the rest of the tribes,
from the east side unto the west

31 And the a gates of the b city shall
be after the names of the tribes of
Israel: three gates northward; one

part of the a vessels of the house of
God: which he carried into the land
of b Shinar to the house of his god;
and he brought the c vessels into the
treasure house of his god.
3 ¶ And the king spake unto Ashpenaz a the master of his eunuchs,
that he should bring certain of the
children of Israel, and of the king’s
b 
seed, and of the princes;
4 Children in whom was no blemish, but a well favoured, and skilful in
all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science,
and such as had ability in them to
stand in the king’s palace, and whom
they might teach the learning and
the tongue of the Chaldeans.
5 And the king appointed them a
daily a provision of the king’s b meat,
and of the wine which he drank: so
nourishing them three years, that at
the end thereof they might c stand
before the king.
6 Now among these were of the
children of Judah, a Daniel, b Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
7 Unto whom the prince of the
eunuchs gave a names: for he gave
unto Daniel the b name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach;
and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to
Azariah, of Abed-nego.
8 ¶ But Daniel a purposed in his
heart that he would not b defile himself with the portion of the king’s
meat, nor with the c wine which he
drank: therefore he requested of
the prince of the eunuchs that he
might not defile himself.
9 Now God had brought Daniel
into a favour and b tender love with
the prince of the eunuchs.

10 And the prince of the eunuchs
said unto Daniel, I a fear my lord the
king, who hath appointed your meat
and your drink: for why should he
see your faces b worse liking than
the children which are of your c sort?
then shall ye make me endanger my
head to the king.
11 Then said Daniel to a Melzar,
whom the prince of the eunuchs had
set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael,
and Azariah,
12 Prove thy servants, I beseech
thee, ten days; and let them give us
a 
pulse to eat, and water to drink.
13 Then let our a countenances be
looked upon before thee, and the
countenance of the children that eat
of the portion of the king’s meat:
and as thou seest, deal with thy
servants.
14 So he consented to them in this
matter, and proved them ten days.
15 And at the end of ten days their
countenances appeared fairer and
fatter in flesh than all the children
which did eat the portion of the
king’s meat.
16 Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine
that they should drink; and gave
them pulse.
17 ¶ As for these four children,
God gave them a knowledge and
skill in all b learning and wisdom:
and Daniel had c understanding in
all d visions and dreams.
18 Now at the end of the days that
the king had said he should bring
them in, then the prince of the
eunuchs brought them in before
Nebuchadnezzar.

them; and among them all was found
none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael,
and Azariah: therefore stood they
before the king.
20 And in all matters of wisdom
and understanding, that the king
inquired of them, he found them
ten times better than all the a magicians and astrologers that were in
all his realm.
21 And Daniel continued even unto
the first year of king Cyrus.
Chapter 2
Nebuchadnezzar’s dream is revealed to
Daniel—The king saw a great image,
a stone cut from the mountain without
hands destroyed the image, and the stone
grew and filled the whole earth—The
stone is the latter-day kingdom of God.
And in the second year of the reign
of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a dreams, wherewith
his spirit was b troubled, and his
sleep brake from him.
2 Then the king commanded to
call the a magicians, and the astrolo­
gers, and the sorcerers, and the
Chaldeans, for to shew the king his
dreams. So they came and stood
before the king.
3 And the king said unto them, I
have dreamed a dream, and my spirit
was troubled to know the dream.
4 Then spake the Chaldeans to the
king in a Syriack, O king, live for ever:
tell thy servants the dream, and we
will b shew the interpretation.
5 The king answered and said to
the Chaldeans, The thing is a gone
from me: if ye will not make known
unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be b cut
in pieces, and your houses shall be
made a dunghill.

the interpretation thereof, ye shall

receive of me gifts and rewards
and great honour: therefore shew
me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.
7 They answered again and said,
Let the king tell his servants the
dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.
8 The king answered and said, I
know of certainty that ye would
gain the time, because ye see the
thing is gone from me.
9 But if ye will not make known
unto me the dream, there is but one
decree for you: for ye have prepared
lying and corrupt words to speak
before me, a till the time be changed:
therefore tell me the dream, and I
shall know that ye can shew me the
interpretation thereof.
10 ¶ The Chaldeans answered
before the king, and said, There is
not a man upon the earth that can
shew the king’s matter: therefore
there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that
asked such things at any magician,
or astrologer, or Chaldean.
11 And it is a rare thing that the king
requireth, and there is none other
that can shew it before the king,
except the a gods, whose dwelling is
not with flesh.
12 For this cause the king was
angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men
of Babylon.
13 And the decree went forth that
the wise men should be slain; and
they sought Daniel and his fellows
to be slain.
14 ¶ Then Daniel answered with
counsel and wisdom to Arioch the
captain of the king’s guard, which
was gone forth to slay the wise men
of Babylon:

Arioch made the thing known to

16 Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give
him time, and that he would shew
the king the interpretation.
17 Then Daniel went to his house,
and made the thing known to
a 
Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
his companions:
18 That they would desire mercies
of the God of heaven concerning this
secret; that Daniel and his fellows
should not perish with the rest of
the wise men of Babylon.
19 ¶ Then was the a secret revealed
unto Daniel in a night b vision. Then
Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
20 Daniel answered and said,
Blessed be the name of God for ever
and ever: for a wisdom and might
are his:
21 And he changeth the a times and
the b seasons: he c removeth kings,
and setteth up kings: he giveth d wisdom unto the wise, and e knowledge
to them that know understanding:
22 He a revealeth the deep and secret things: he b knoweth what is in
the darkness, and the c light dwelleth with him.
23 I thank thee, and praise thee, O
thou God of my fathers, who hast
given me wisdom and might, and hast
made known unto me now what we
desired of thee: for thou hast now
made known unto us the king’s matter.
24 ¶ Therefore Daniel went in
unto Arioch, whom the king had
ordained to destroy the wise men
of Babylon: he went and said thus
unto him; Destroy not the wise men

25 Then Arioch brought in Daniel
before the king in haste, and said
thus unto him, I have found a man
of the captives of Judah, that will
make known unto the king the interpretation.
26 The king answered and said to
Daniel, whose a name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make b known
unto me the dream which I have
seen, and the interpretation thereof?
27 Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded
cannot the wise men, the a astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers,
shew unto the king;
28 But there is a God in heaven
that a revealeth b secrets, and maketh
known to the king Nebuchadnezzar
what shall be in the latter days. Thy
c 
dream, and the visions of thy head
upon thy bed, are these;
29 As for thee, O king, thy thoughts
came into thy mind upon thy bed,
what should come to pass hereafter: and he that a revealeth secrets
maketh known to thee what shall
come to pass.
30 But as for me, this secret is not
revealed to me for any a wisdom
that I have more than any living,
but b for their sakes that shall make
known the interpretation to the
king, and that thou mightest know
the thoughts of thy heart.

stood before thee; and b the form
thereof was terrible.
32 This image’s head was of fine
gold, his breast and his arms of
silver, his belly and his thighs of
brass,
33 His legs of iron, his feet part of
iron and part of clay.
34 Thou sawest till that a a stone
was cut out b without hands, which
smote the image upon his feet that
were of iron and clay, and brake
them to pieces.
35 Then was the iron, the clay, the
brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became
like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them
away, that no a place was found for
them: and the b stone that smote the
image became a great mountain,
and filled the whole earth.
36 ¶ This is the dream; and we
will tell the interpretation thereof
before the king.
37 Thou, O king, art a king of
kings: for the God of heaven hath
given thee a a kingdom, power, and
strength, and glory.
38 And wheresoever the children
of men dwell, the beasts of the field
and the fowls of the heaven hath
he given into thine hand, and hath
made thee ruler over them all. Thou
art this a head of gold.
39 And after thee shall arise another a kingdom inferior to thee,
and another third kingdom of
brass, which shall bear b rule over
all the earth.
40 And the fourth a kingdom shall
be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron

and bruise.
41 And whereas thou sawest the
feet and toes, part of potters’ clay,
and part of iron, the kingdom shall
be divided; but there shall be in it
of the strength of the a iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed
with miry clay.
42 And as the toes of the feet were
part of iron, and part of clay, so the
kingdom shall be partly strong, and
partly broken.
43 And whereas thou sawest iron
mixed with miry clay, they shall
mingle themselves with the seed
of men: but they shall not cleave
one to another, even as iron is not
mixed with clay.
44 And in the a days of these b kings
shall the God of heaven c set up a
d 
kingdom, which shall never be e destroyed: and the f kingdom shall not
be left to other people, but it shall
g 
break in pieces and h consume all
these i kingdoms, and it shall stand
for ever.
45 Forasmuch as thou sawest that
the a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it
brake in pieces the iron, the brass,
the clay, the silver, and the gold;
the great God hath made b known
to the king what shall come to pass
hereafter: and the dream is certain,
and the interpretation thereof sure.
46 ¶ Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and a worshipped Daniel, and commanded
that they should offer an oblation
and sweet odours unto him.

seeing thou couldest reveal this
secret.
48 Then the king made Daniel a
a 
great man, and gave him many
great gifts, and made him ruler over
the whole province of Babylon, and
chief of the governors over all the
wise men of Babylon.
49 Then Daniel requested of the
king, and he a set Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abed-nego, over the affairs of
the province of Babylon: but Daniel
b 
sat in the gate of the king.
Chapter 3
Nebuchadnezzar creates a golden image and commands all men to worship
it—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego
refuse and are cast into the fiery furnace—They are preserved and come
out unharmed.
Nebuchadnezzar the king made
an image of gold, whose height was
threescore cubits, and the breadth
thereof six cubits: he set it up in
the plain of Dura, in the province
of Babylon.
2 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king
sent to gather together the princes,
the governors, and the captains, the
judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers
of the provinces, to come to the dedi­
cation of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
3 Then the princes, the governors,
and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs,
and all the rulers of the provinces,
were gathered together unto the
dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and
they stood before the image that
Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
4 Then an herald cried aloud, To
you it is commanded, O people,
nations, and a languages,
5 That at what time ye hear the

sound of the cornet, flute, a harp,
b 
sackbut, psaltery, c dulcimer, and
all kinds of musick, ye fall down
and worship the golden image that
Nebuchadnezzar the king hath
set up:
6 And whoso falleth not down and
worshippeth shall the same hour be
a 
cast into the midst of a b burning
fiery furnace.
7 Therefore at that time, when all
the people heard the sound of the
cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all
the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped
the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
8 ¶ Wherefore at that time certain
Chaldeans came near, and accused
the Jews.
9 They spake and said to the king
Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for
ever.
10 Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear
the sound of the cornet, flute, harp,
sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and
all kinds of musick, shall fall down
and worship the golden image:
11 And whoso falleth not down
and worshippeth, that he should
be cast into the midst of a burning
fiery furnace.
12 There are certain Jews whom
thou hast a set over the affairs of the
province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O
king, have not regarded thee: they
serve not thy gods, nor worship
the golden image which thou hast
set up.
13 ¶ Then Nebuchadnezzar in his
rage and fury commanded to bring
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.
Then they brought these men before the king.

unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach,

serve my gods, nor worship the
golden image which I have set up?
15 Now if ye be ready that at what
time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery,
and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the
image which I have made; well: but
if ye worship not, ye shall be cast
the same hour into the midst of a
burning fiery furnace; and who is
that God that shall deliver you out
of my hands?
16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king,
O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not a careful to answer thee in this matter.
17 If it be so, our God whom we
serve is able to a deliver us from the
burning fiery furnace, and he will
deliver us out of thine hand, O king.
18 But if not, be it known unto
thee, O king, that we will not a serve
thy gods, nor worship the golden
image which thou hast set up.
19 ¶ Then was Nebuchadnezzar
full of fury, and the a form of his
visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego:
therefore he spake, and commanded
that they should heat the furnace
one seven times more than it was
wont to be heated.
20 And he commanded the most
mighty men that were in his army
to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abed-nego, and to cast them into
the burning fiery furnace.
21 Then these men were bound in
their coats, their hosen, and their
hats, and their other garments, and
were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
22 Therefore because the king’s
commandment was urgent, and the
furnace exceeding hot, the flame
of the fire slew those men that
took up Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abed-nego.

bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
24 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king
was astonied, and rose up in haste,
and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men
bound into the midst of the fire?
They answered and said unto the
king, True, O king.
25 He answered and said, Lo, I
see four men loose, walking in the
midst of the fire, and they have no
a 
hurt; and the form of the fourth is
like the Son of God.
26 ¶ Then Nebuchadnezzar came
near to the mouth of the burning
fiery furnace, and spake, and said,
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,
ye servants of the most high God,
come forth, and come hither. Then
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,
came forth of the midst of the fire.
27 And the princes, governors, and
captains, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw
these men, upon whose bodies the
a 
fire had no power, nor was an hair
of their head singed, neither were
their coats b changed, nor the smell
of fire had passed on them.
28 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake,
and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who
hath sent his a angel, and delivered
his servants that b trusted in him,
and c have changed the king’s word,
and yielded their bodies, that they
might not serve nor worship any
god, except their own God.
29 Therefore I make a decree, That
every people, nation, and language,
which speak any thing amiss against
the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abed-nego, shall be a cut in pieces,
and their houses shall be made a
dunghill: because there is no other
God that can b deliver after this sort.

30 Then the king a promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in
the province of Babylon.
Chapter 4
Daniel interprets Nebuchadnezzar’s
dream of the great tree, describing the
king’s fall and madness—The king
learns that the Most High rules and
sets the basest of men over earthly
kingdoms.
Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto
all people, nations, and languages,
that dwell in all the earth; Peace be
multiplied unto you.
2 I thought it good to shew the
signs and wonders that the high
God hath wrought toward me.
3 How great are his signs! and how
mighty are his wonders! his a kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and
his dominion is from generation to
generation.
4 ¶ I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest
in mine house, and a flourishing in
my palace:
5 I saw a dream which made me
afraid, and the thoughts upon my
bed and the visions of my head
troubled me.
6 Therefore made I a decree to
bring in all the a wise men of Babylon
before me, that they might make
known unto me the interpretation
of the dream.
7 Then came in the a magicians, the
astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the
soothsayers: and I told the dream
before them; but they did not make
known unto me the interpretation
thereof.
8 ¶ But at the last Daniel came in
before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of
my god, and in whom is the spirit
of the holy a gods: and before him
I told the dream, saying,
9 O Belteshazzar, master of the
magicians, because I know that the
spirit of the holy gods is in thee,
and no secret troubleth thee, tell
	30	a	 Esth. 10:2 (2–3).
4	3	a	 tg  Kingdom of God, on
Earth.

me the visions of my dream that I
have seen, and the interpretation
thereof.
10 Thus were the visions of mine
head in my bed; I saw, and behold
a tree in the midst of the earth, and
the height thereof was great.
11 The tree grew, and was strong,
and the height thereof reached unto
heaven, and the sight thereof to the
end of all the earth:
12 The leaves thereof were fair, and
the fruit thereof much, and in it was
meat for all: the beasts of the field
had shadow under it, and the fowls
of the heaven dwelt in the boughs
thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.
13 I saw in the visions of my head
upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher
and an holy one came down from
heaven;
14 He cried aloud, and said thus,
Hew down the tree, and cut off his
branches, shake off his leaves, and
scatter his fruit: let the beasts get
away from under it, and the fowls
from his branches:
15 Nevertheless leave the stump
of his roots in the earth, even with
a band of iron and brass, in the
tender grass of the field; and let it
be wet with the dew of heaven, and
let his portion be with the beasts in
the grass of the earth:
16 Let his heart be changed from
man’s, and let a beast’s heart be
given unto him; and let seven a times
pass over him.
17 This matter is by the decree of
the watchers, and the demand by
the word of the holy ones: to the
intent that the living may know
that the most High ruleth in the
kingdom of men, and giveth it to
whomsoever he will, and setteth up
over it the a basest of men.
18 This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O
Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the
wise men of my kingdom are not
able to make known unto me the

interpretation: but thou art able;
for the a spirit of the b holy gods is
in thee.
19 ¶ Then Daniel, whose name
was Belteshazzar, was astonied for
one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said,
Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or
the interpretation thereof, trouble
thee. Belteshazzar answered and
said, My lord, the dream be to them
that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.
20 The tree that thou sawest, which
grew, and was strong, whose height
reached unto the heaven, and the
sight thereof to all the earth;
21 Whose leaves were fair, and the
fruit thereof much, and in it was
meat for all; under which the beasts
of the field dwelt, and upon whose
branches the fowls of the heaven
had their habitation:
22 It is thou, O king, that art grown
and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto
heaven, and thy a dominion to the
end of the earth.
23 And whereas the king saw a
watcher and an holy one coming
down from heaven, and saying, Hew
the tree down, and destroy it; yet
leave the stump of the roots thereof
in the earth, even with a band of
iron and brass, in the tender grass
of the field; and let it be wet with
the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field,
till seven times pass over him;
24 This is the interpretation, O
king, and this is the decree of the
most High, which is come upon my
lord the king:
25 That they shall drive thee from
men, and thy dwelling shall be
with the beasts of the field, and
they shall make thee to eat grass
as oxen, and they shall wet thee
with the dew of heaven, and seven
times shall pass over thee, till thou
know that the most High ruleth in

		b	 tg  Holiness.
	22	a	 Jer. 27:7 (6–8).

the kingdom of men, and giveth it
to whomsoever he will.
26 And whereas they commanded
to leave the stump of the tree roots;
thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee,
after that thou shalt have known
that the heavens do rule.
27 Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and
break off thy sins by righteousness,
and thine iniquities by shewing
a 
mercy to the poor; b if it may be
a lengthening of thy tranquillity.
28 ¶ All this came upon the king
Nebuchadnezzar.
29 At the end of twelve months he
walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.
30 The king spake, and said, Is not
this great Babylon, that I have built
a 
for the house of the kingdom by
the might of my power, and for the
honour of my majesty ?
31 While the word was in the
king’s mouth, there fell a voice from
heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The
kingdom is a departed from thee.
32 And they shall drive thee from
men, and thy dwelling shall be with
the beasts of the field: they shall
make thee to eat grass as oxen, and
seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High
ruleth in the kingdom of men, and
giveth it to whomsoever he will.
33 The same hour was the thing
fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and
he was driven from men, and did
eat grass as oxen, and his body was
wet with the dew of heaven, till his
hairs were grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws.
34 And at the end of a the days I
Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine
eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and
I blessed the most High, and I
praised and honoured him that
liveth for ever, whose dominion is
an everlasting dominion, and his

35 And all the inhabitants of the
earth are reputed as a nothing: and
he doeth according to his b will in
the army of heaven, and among the
inhabitants of the earth: and none
can c stay his hand, or say unto him,
What doest thou?
36 At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory
of my kingdom, mine honour and
brightness returned unto me; and
my counsellors and my lords sought
unto me; and I was established in
my kingdom, and excellent majesty
was added unto me.
37 Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise
and extol and honour the King of
heaven, all whose works are truth,
and his ways a judgment: and those
that b walk in pride he is able to
c 
abase.
Chapter 5
Belshazzar and his revelers drink from
the vessels of the temple—A hand writes
upon the wall, telling of Belshazzar’s
downfall—Daniel interprets the words
and reproves the king for pride and idola­
try—That night Babylon is conquered.
Belshazzar the king made a great
feast to a thousand of his lords, and
drank wine before the thousand.
2 Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the
wine, commanded to bring the
golden and silver a vessels which
his father Nebuchadnezzar had
taken out of the temple which was
in Jerusalem; that the king, and his
princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.
3 Then they brought the golden
vessels that were taken out of the
temple of the house of God which
was at Jerusalem; and the king, and
his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.

4 They drank wine, and praised
the gods of gold, and of silver, of

5 ¶ In the same hour came forth
fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote
a 
over against the candlestick upon
the plaster of the wall of the king’s
palace: and the king saw the part
of the b hand that wrote.
6 Then the king’s a countenance was
changed, and his thoughts b troubled
him, so that c the joints of his loins
were loosed, and his knees smote
one against another.
7 The king cried aloud to bring
in the a astrologers, the Chaldeans,
and the soothsayers. And the king
spake, and said to the wise men of
Babylon, Whosoever shall read this
writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with
scarlet, and have a chain of gold
about his neck, and shall be the
third ruler in the kingdom.
8 Then came in all the king’s wise
men: but they could not read the
writing, nor make known to the
king the interpretation thereof.
9 Then was king Belshazzar greatly
troubled, and his countenance was
changed in him, and his lords were
astonied.
10 ¶ Now the queen, by reason of
the words of the king and his lords,
came into the banquet house: and
the queen spake and said, O king,
live for ever: let not thy thoughts
trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:
11 There is a man in thy kingdom,
in whom is the a spirit of the holy
gods; and in the days of thy father
light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods,
was found in him; whom the king
Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the
king, I say, thy father, made master
of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;

12 Forasmuch as an excellent

and shewing of hard sentences, and
dissolving of doubts, were found in
the same Daniel, whom the king
a 
named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the
interpretation.
13 Then was Daniel brought in
before the king. And the king spake
and said unto Daniel, Art thou that
Daniel, which art of the children of
the captivity of Judah, whom the
king my father brought out of Jewry  ?
14 I have even heard of thee, that
the spirit of the a gods is in thee, and
that light and understanding and
excellent wisdom is found in thee.
15 And now the wise men, the a astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this
writing, and make known unto me
the interpretation thereof: but they
could not shew the interpretation
of the thing:
16 And I have heard of thee, that
thou canst make interpretations,
and dissolve doubts: now if thou
canst read the a writing, and make
b 
known to me the interpretation
thereof, thou shalt be clothed with
scarlet, and have a chain of gold
about thy neck, and shalt be the
third ruler in the kingdom.
17 ¶ Then Daniel answered and
said before the king, Let thy a gifts
be to thyself, and give thy rewards
to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known
to him the interpretation.
18 O thou king, the most high God
gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a

and honour:

and whom he would he put down.
20 But when his a heart was lifted
up, and his b mind hardened in
pride, he was c deposed from his
kingly throne, and they took his
glory from him:
21 And he was driven a from the
sons of men; and his heart was
made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they
fed him with grass like oxen, and
his body was wet with the dew of
heaven; till he knew that the most
high God ruled in the kingdom of
men, and that he appointeth over
it whomsoever he will.
22 And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart,
though thou knewest all this;
23 But hast lifted up thyself against
the Lord of heaven; and they have
brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords,
thy wives, and thy concubines,
have drunk wine in them; and thou
hast praised the a gods of silver,

29 Then commanded Belshazzar,
and they a clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about
his neck, and made a proclamation
concerning him, that he should be
the third ruler in the kingdom.
30 ¶ In that night was Belshazzar

31 And a Darius the Median took
the kingdom, being about threescore
and two years old.
Chapter 6
Darius makes Daniel the first of his
presidents—Daniel worships the Lord
in defiance of a decree of Darius—He
is cast into the den of lions—His faith
saves him, and Darius decrees that all
people are to revere the God of Daniel.
It pleased Darius to set over the
kingdom an hundred and twenty
princes, which should be over the
whole kingdom;
2 And over these three presidents;
of whom Daniel was a first: that the
princes might give accounts unto
them, and the king should have no
damage.
3 Then this Daniel was preferred
above the presidents and princes,
because an excellent a spirit was in
him; and the king thought to set
him b over the whole realm.
4 ¶ Then the presidents and prin­
ces sought to find a occasion against
Daniel concerning the kingdom; but
they could find none occasion nor
fault; forasmuch as he was faithful,
neither was there any error or fault
found in him.
5 Then said these men, We shall
not find any occasion against this
Daniel, except we find it against
him concerning the law of his God.
6 Then these presidents and
princes assembled together to the
king, and said thus unto him, King
Darius, live for ever.

for thirty days, save of thee, O king,
he shall be a cast into the den of

8 Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be
not changed, according to the law

a 
altereth not.
9 Wherefore king Darius signed
the writing and the decree.
10 ¶ Now when Daniel knew that
the writing was signed, he went into
his house; and his windows being
open in his chamber toward a Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees
b 
three times a day, and c prayed, and
gave d thanks before his God, as he
did aforetime.
11 Then these men assembled, and
found Daniel praying and making
supplication before his God.
12 Then they came near, and spake
before the king concerning the
king’s decree; Hast thou not signed
a decree, that every man that shall
ask a petition of any God or man
within thirty days, save of thee, O
king, shall be cast into the den of
lions? The king answered and said,
The thing is true, according to the
law of the Medes and Persians,
which altereth not.
13 Then answered they and said
before the king, That a Daniel, which
is of the children of the captivity
of Judah, regardeth not thee, O
king, nor the decree that thou hast
signed, but maketh his petition
three times a day.

Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the
sun to deliver him.
15 Then these men assembled
unto the king, and said unto the
king, Know, O king, that the law of
the Medes and Persians is, That no
decree nor statute which the king
establisheth may be changed.
16 Then the king commanded, and
they brought Daniel, and cast him
into the den of lions. Now the king
spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God
whom thou servest continually, he
will deliver thee.
17 And a stone was brought, and
laid upon the mouth of the den;
and the king a sealed it with his
own signet, and with the signet of
his lords; that the purpose might
not be changed concerning Daniel.
18 ¶ Then the king went to his
palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of
musick brought before him: and
his sleep went from him.
19 Then the king arose very early
in the morning, and went in haste
unto the den of lions.
20 And when he came to the den,
he cried with a lamentable voice
unto Daniel: and the king spake
and said to Daniel, O Daniel, a servant of the living God, is thy God,
whom thou servest continually,
able to deliver thee from the lions?
21 Then said Daniel unto the king,
O king, live for ever.
22 My God hath sent his a angel,
and hath shut the b lions’ mouths,
that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was
found in me; and also before thee,
O king, have I done no hurt.
23 Then was the king exceeding
glad for him, and commanded that
they should take Daniel up out of

hurt was found upon him, because
he a believed in his God.
24 ¶ And the king commanded,
and they brought those men which
had accused Daniel, and they cast
them into the den of lions, them,
their children, and their wives; and
the lions a had the mastery of them,
and brake all their bones in pieces
or ever they came at the bottom of
the den.
25 ¶ Then king Darius wrote unto
all people, nations, and languages,
that dwell in all the earth; Peace be
multiplied unto you.
26 I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men
tremble and fear before the God of
Daniel: for he is the a living God, and
b 
steadfast for ever, and his kingdom
that which shall not be c destroyed,
and his dominion shall be even unto
the end.
27 He a delivereth and rescueth,
and he worketh signs and wonders
in heaven and in earth, who hath
b 
delivered Daniel from the power
of the lions.
28 So this Daniel prospered in the
reign of a Darius, and in the reign
of b Cyrus the Persian.

Daniel sees four beasts representing the
kingdoms of men—He sees the ancient
of days (Adam) to whom the Son of Man
(Christ) will come—The kingdom will
be given to the Saints forever.
In the first year of Belshazzar king
of Babylon Daniel had a a dream and
visions of his head upon his bed:
then he wrote the dream, and told
the sum of the matters.

my vision by night, and, behold,

upon the great sea.

from the b sea, diverse one from
another.
4 The a first was like a lion, and
had eagle’s wings: I beheld till the
wings thereof were plucked, and it
was lifted up from the earth, and
made stand upon the feet as a man,
and a man’s heart was given to it.
5 And behold another a beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up
itself on one side, and it had three
ribs in the mouth of it between the
teeth of it: and they said thus unto
it, Arise, devour much flesh.
6 After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had
upon the back of it four wings of a
fowl; the beast had also four a heads;
and dominion was given to it.
7 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth a beast,
dreadful and terrible, and strong
exceedingly; and it had great b iron
teeth: it devoured and brake in
pieces, and stamped the residue
with the feet of it: and it was diverse
from all the beasts that were before
it; and it had c ten horns.
8 I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them
another little a horn, before whom
there were three of the first horns
plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the
eyes of man, and a b mouth speaking
great things.
9 ¶ I beheld till the a thrones were
b 
cast down, and the c Ancient of days
did sit, whose d garment was white
as snow, and the hair of his head
like the pure wool: his throne was
like the fiery flame, and his e wheels
as burning fire.

11 I beheld then because of the
voice of the great words which
the horn spake: I beheld even till
the a beast was slain, and his body
destroyed, and given to the burning b flame.
12 As concerning the rest of the
beasts, they had their dominion
taken away: yet their lives were

behold, one like the a Son of man
came with the b clouds of heaven,
and came to the Ancient of days,

15 ¶ I Daniel was grieved in my
spirit in the midst of my body, and

that stood by, and asked him the
truth of all this. So he told me, and
made me know the interpretation

the kingdom for ever, even for ever
and ever.
19 Then I would know the truth of
the fourth beast, which was diverse
from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and
his nails of brass; which devoured,
brake in pieces, and stamped the
residue with his feet;
20 And of the ten horns that were
in his head, and of the other which
came up, and before whom three
fell; even of that horn that had eyes,
and a mouth that spake very great
things, whose look was more stout
than his fellows.
21 I beheld, and the same horn
made a war with the saints, and
prevailed against them;
22 Until the a Ancient of days came,
and b judgment was given to the
c 
saints of the most High; and the
time came that the saints possessed
the kingdom.
23 Thus he said, The fourth beast
shall be the fourth kingdom upon
earth, which shall be diverse from
all kingdoms, and shall devour the
whole earth, and shall tread it down,
and break it in pieces.
24 And the ten a horns out of this
kingdom are b ten kings that shall
arise: and another shall rise after
them; and he shall be diverse from
the first, and he shall subdue three
kings.
25 And he shall speak great words
against the most High, and shall
a 
wear out the saints of the most
High, and think to change times
and laws: and they shall be given
into his hand until a time and times
and the dividing of time.
26 But the a judgment shall sit, and
they shall take away his dominion,
to consume and to destroy it unto
the end.

ion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall
be b given to the people of the saints
of the most High, whose kingdom
is an c everlasting kingdom, and all
dominions shall serve and obey him.
28 Hitherto is the end of the matter.
As for me Daniel, my a cogitations
much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept
the matter in my heart.
Chapter 8
Daniel sees in vision a ram (Media and
Persia), a goat (Greece), four other kings,
and then, in the last days, a fierce king
who will destroy the holy people—This
king will be broken when he stands up
against the Prince of Princes.
In the third year of the reign of
king Belshazzar a vision appeared
unto me, even unto me Daniel, after
that which appeared unto me at
the first.
2 And I saw in a vision; and it
came to pass, when I saw, that I was
at Shushan in the palace, which is
in the province of Elam; and I saw
in a vision, and I was by the a river
of Ulai.
3 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and
saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a a ram which had
two horns: and the two horns were
high; but one was higher than the
other, and the higher came up last.
4 I saw the ram a pushing westward,
and northward, and southward;
so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that
could deliver out of his hand; but
he b did according to his will, and
became great.
5 And as I was considering, behold,
an he a goat came from the west on
the face of the whole earth, and
touched not the ground: and the

goat had a notable horn between
his eyes.
6 And he came to the ram that
had two horns, which I had seen
standing before the river, and ran
unto him in the fury of his power.
7 And I saw him come close unto
the ram, and he was a moved with
b 
choler against him, and smote the
ram, and brake his two horns: and
there was no power in the ram to
stand before him, but he cast him
down to the ground, and stamped
upon him: and there was none
that could deliver the ram out of
his hand.
8 Therefore the he goat waxed very
great: and when he was strong, the
great horn was broken; and a for it
came up b four notable ones toward
the four winds of heaven.
9 And out of one of them came
forth a little a horn, which waxed
exceeding great, toward the south,
and toward the east, and toward the
pleasant land.
10 And it waxed great, even a to the
host of heaven; and it cast down
some of the host and of the stars
to the ground, and stamped upon
them.
11 Yea, he magnified himself even
to the prince of the host, and by
him the a daily b sacrifice was taken
away, and the place of his sanctuary was c cast down.
12 And an host was given him
against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast
down the truth to the ground; and
it practised, and prospered.
13 ¶ Then I heard one a saint speaking, and another saint said unto
that certain saint which spake, How
long shall be the vision concerning
the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both

the sanctuary and the host to be
trodden under foot?
14 And he said unto me, Unto two
thousand and three hundred days;
then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
15 ¶ And it came to pass, when I,
even I Daniel, had seen the vision,
and sought for the meaning, then,
behold, there stood before me as
the appearance of a man.
16 And I heard a man’s voice between the a banks of Ulai, which
called, and said, b Gabriel, make
this man to understand the vision.
17 So he came near where I stood:
and when he came, I was afraid,
and fell upon my face: but he said
unto me, Understand, O son of man:
for at the time of the end shall be
the vision.
18 Now as he was speaking with
me, I was in a deep sleep on my face
toward the ground: but he a touched
me, and set me upright.
19 And he said, Behold, I will make
thee know what shall be a in the
last end of the indignation: for at
the time appointed the end shall be.
20 The a ram which thou sawest
having two horns are the kings of
Media and Persia.
21 And the rough a goat is the king
of b Grecia: and the great horn that
is between his eyes is the first king.
22 Now that being a broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the
nation, but not in his power.
23 And in the latter time of their
kingdom, when the transgressors
are come to the full, a king of fierce
countenance, and understanding
a 
dark sentences, shall stand up.
24 And his power shall be mighty,
but not by his own power: and he
shall a destroy wonderfully, and

spake in thy name to our kings, our

13 As it is written in the a law of
Moses, all this evil is come upon us:
yet made we not our prayer before
the Lord our God, that we might
turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.
14 Therefore hath the Lord
watched upon the a evil, and brought
it upon us: for the Lord our God is
righteous in all his works which he
doeth: for we b obeyed not his voice.
15 And now, O Lord our God, that
hast brought thy people forth out
of the land of Egypt with a mighty
hand, and hast gotten thee renown,
as at this day; we have sinned, we
have done wickedly.
16 ¶ O Lord, according to all thy
a 
righteousness, I beseech thee, let
thine anger and thy fury be turned
away from thy city Jerusalem, thy
holy b mountain: because for our
sins, and for the iniquities of our
fathers, Jerusalem and thy people
are become a c reproach to all that
are about us.
17 Now therefore, O our God, hear
the prayer of thy servant, and his
supplications, and cause thy face to
a 
shine upon thy sanctuary that is
desolate, for the Lord’s sake.
18 O my God, incline thine ear,
and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city
which is called by thy name: for we
do not present our supplications
before thee for our righteousnesses,
but for thy great mercies.
19 O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive;
O Lord, hearken and do; defer not,
for thine own sake, O my God: for
thy city and thy people are called
by thy name.

forth, and I am come to shew thee;

upon thy people and upon thy holy

and the end thereof shall be with a

Daniel sees the Lord and others in a
glorious vision—He is shown what is
to be in the latter days.
In the third year of Cyrus king of
Persia a thing was revealed unto
Daniel, whose name was called
Belteshazzar; and the thing was true,
but the time appointed was long:
and he understood the thing, and
had a understanding of the vision.
2 In those days I Daniel was
a 
mourning three full weeks.
3 I ate no a pleasant bread, neither
came flesh nor wine in my mouth,
neither did I anoint myself at all,
till three whole weeks were fulfilled.
4 And in the four and twentieth
day of the first month, as I was by
the side of the great river, which
is a Hiddekel;
5 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and
looked, and behold a certain man
a 
clothed in linen, whose loins were
girded with fine gold of Uphaz:
6 His body also was like the beryl,
and his face as the appearance of
lightning, and his eyes as lamps of
fire, and his arms and his feet like
in colour to polished brass, and the
voice of his words like the voice of
a multitude.
7 And I Daniel alone saw the a vision: for the men that were with
me saw not the vision; but a great
quaking fell upon them, so that they
fled to hide themselves.

saw this great vision, and there
remained no a strength in me: for
my comeliness was turned in me
into corruption, and I retained no
strength.
9 Yet heard I the voice of his words:
and when I heard the voice of his
words, then was I in a deep sleep
on my face, and my face a toward
the ground.
10 ¶ And, behold, an hand touched
me, which set me upon my knees
and upon the palms of my hands.
11 And he said unto me, O Daniel,
a man greatly a beloved, understand
the words that I speak unto thee,
and stand upright: for unto thee
am I now sent. And when he had
spoken this word unto me, I stood
trembling.
12 Then said he unto me, a Fear
not, Daniel: for from the first day
that thou didst b set thine heart to
understand, and to c chasten thyself
before thy God, thy words were
d 
heard, and I am come for thy words.
13 But the prince of the kingdom
of Persia withstood me one and
twenty days: but, lo, a Michael, one
of the chief princes, came to help
me; and I remained there with the
kings of Persia.
14 Now I am come to make thee
understand what shall befall thy
people in the latter days: for yet
the vision is for many days.
15 And when he had spoken such
words unto me, I set my face toward
the ground, and I became a dumb.
16 And, behold, one like the simili­
tude of the sons of men touched
my lips: then I opened my mouth,
and spake, and said unto him that
stood before me, O my lord, by the
vision my sorrows are turned upon
me, and I have retained no strength.

17 For how can the servant of this
my lord talk with this my lord? for as
for me, straightway there remained
no strength in me, neither is there
breath left in me.
18 Then there came again and
touched me one like the appearance
of a man, and he strengthened me,
19 And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee,
be strong, yea, be strong. And
when he had spoken unto me, I
was strengthened, and said, Let my
lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.
20 Then said he, Knowest thou
wherefore I come unto thee? and
now will I return to fight with the
prince of Persia: and when I am
gone forth, lo, the prince of a Grecia shall come.
21 a But I will shew thee that which
is noted in the scripture of truth:
and there is none that holdeth with
me in these things, but b Michael

Chapter 11
Daniel sees the successive kings and
their wars, leagues, and conf licts
that lead up to the Second Coming of
Christ.
Also I in the first year of a Darius
the Mede, even I, stood to confirm
and to strengthen him.
2 And now will I shew thee the
truth. Behold, there shall stand up
yet three kings in Persia; and the
fourth shall be far richer than they
all: and by his strength through his
riches he shall stir up all against
the a realm of b Grecia.
3 And a mighty king shall stand
up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do a according to his will.
4 And when he shall stand up, his
kingdom shall be a broken, and shall

which he ruled: for his kingdom

5 ¶ And the king of the south shall
be strong, and one of his princes;
and he shall be strong above him,
and have dominion; his dominion
shall be a great dominion.
6 And in the end of years they
shall join themselves together; for
the king’s daughter of the south
shall come to the king of the north
to make an agreement: but she shall
not retain the power of the arm;
neither shall he stand, nor his arm:
but she shall be given up, and they

into Egypt their gods, with their

9 So the king of the south shall
come into his kingdom, and shall
return into his own land.
10 But his sons shall be stirred
up, and shall assemble a multitude
of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass
through: then shall he return, and

the multitude shall be given into
his hand.
12 And when he hath taken away
the multitude, his heart shall be
lifted up; and he shall cast down
many ten thousands: but he shall
not be strengthened by it.
13 For the king of the north shall
return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and
shall certainly come after certain
years with a great army and with
much riches.
14 And in those times there shall
many stand up against the king of
the south: also the a robbers of thy
people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.
15 So the king of the north shall
come, and cast up a a mount, and
take the most fenced cities: and the
arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people,
neither shall there be any strength
to withstand.
16 But he that cometh against him
shall do according to his own will,
and none shall stand before him:
and he shall stand in the glorious
land, which by his hand shall be
consumed.
17 He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole
kingdom, and upright ones with
him; thus shall he do: and he shall
give him the daughter of women,
corrupting her: but she shall not
stand on his side, neither be for him.
18 After this shall he turn his face
unto the isles, and shall take many:
but a prince for his own behalf shall
cause the reproach offered by him
to cease; without his own reproach
he shall cause it to turn upon him.
19 Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but
he shall stumble and fall, and not
be found.
20 Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of
the kingdom: but within few days
he shall be destroyed, neither in
anger, nor in battle.

21 And in his estate shall stand up

22 And with the arms of a a flood
shall they be overflown from before
him, and shall be broken; yea, also
the prince of the covenant.
23 And after the league made with
him he shall work deceitfully: for
he shall come up, and shall become
strong with a small people.
24 He shall enter peaceably even
upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which
his fathers have not done, nor his
fathers’ fathers; he shall scatter
among them the prey, and spoil,
and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong
holds, even for a time.
25 And he shall stir up his power
and his courage against the king
of the south with a great army;
and the king of the south shall be
stirred up to battle with a very great
and mighty army; but he shall not
stand: for they shall forecast devices
against him.
26 Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him,
and his army shall overflow: and
many shall fall down slain.
27 And both these kings’ hearts
shall be to do mischief, and they
shall speak lies at one table; but
it shall not prosper: for yet the end
shall be at the time appointed.
28 Then shall he return into his
land with great riches; and his heart
shall be against the holy covenant;
and he shall do exploits, and return
to his own land.
29 At the time appointed he shall
return, and come toward the south;
but it shall not be as the former, or

31 And arms shall stand on his
part, and they shall a pollute b the
sanctuary of strength, and shall
take away the daily sacrifice, and
they shall place the c abomination

32 And such as do wickedly against
the covenant shall he corrupt by
flatteries: but the people that do
know their God shall be strong,
and do exploits.
33 And they that understand
among the people shall instruct
many: yet they shall fall by the
sword, and by flame, by captivity,
and by spoil, many days.
34 Now when they shall fall, they
shall be holpen with a little help:
but many shall cleave to them with
flatteries.
35 And some of them of understanding shall fall, to a try them, and
to purge, and to make them white,
even to the time of the end: because
it is yet for a time appointed.

himself, and magnify himself above
every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the a God of gods,
and shall prosper till the b indignation be accomplished: for that that
is determined shall be done.
37 Neither shall he regard the
God of his fathers, nor the desire
of women, nor regard any god: for
he shall magnify himself above all.
38 But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god
whom his fathers knew not shall he
honour with gold, and silver, and
with precious stones, and pleasant
things.

cause them to rule over many, and
shall divide the land for gain.
40 And at the time of the end
shall the king of the south push at
him: and the king of the north shall
come against him like a a whirlwind,
with chariots, and with horsemen,
and with many ships; and he shall

overflow and pass over.
41 He shall enter also into the
glorious land, and many countries
shall be overthrown: but these shall
escape out of his hand, even Edom,
and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.
42 He shall stretch forth his hand
also upon the countries: and the
land of Egypt shall not escape.
43 But he shall have power over
the treasures of gold and of silver,
and over all the precious things
of Egypt: and the Libyans and the
Ethiopians shall a be at his steps.
44 But tidings out of the east and
out of the north shall trouble him:
therefore he shall go forth with
great fury to destroy, and utterly

he shall come to his end, and none

came unto Hosea, the son of
Beeri, in the days of a Uzziah,
Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings
of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
2 The beginning of the word of
the Lord by Hosea. And the Lord
said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a
a 
wife of whoredoms and children
of whoredoms: for the land hath
committed great b whoredom, de­
parting from the Lord.
3 So he went and took Gomer the
daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.
4 And the Lord said unto him,
Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little
while, and I will avenge the blood
of Jezreel upon the house of a Jehu,
and will cause to b cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.
5 And it shall come to pass at that
day, that I will a break the bow of
Israel in the valley of Jezreel.
6 ¶ And she conceived again, and
bare a daughter. And God said unto
him, Call her name a Lo-ruhamah:
for I will b no more have mercy upon
the house of Israel; but I will utterly
take them c away.

Israel will seek the Lord, return to the
Lord, and receive of His goodness in
the latter days.
Then said the Lord unto me, Go
yet, love a woman beloved of her
friend, yet an a adulteress, according
to the love of the Lord toward the
children of Israel, who look to other
gods, and love b flagons of wine.
2 So I bought her to me for fifteen
pieces of silver, and for an homer of
barley, and an half homer of barley:

abide for me many days; thou
shalt not play the harlot, and
thou shalt not be for another man:
so will I also be for thee.
4 For the children of Israel shall
abide many days without a king,

8 They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on
their iniquity.
9 And there shall be, like people,
like priest: and I will punish them
for their ways, and reward them
their doings.
10 For they shall eat, and not
have enough: they shall commit
whoredom, and shall not increase:
because they have left off to take
heed to the Lord.
11 a Whoredom and wine and new
wine take away the heart.
12 ¶ My people ask a counsel at
their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the b spirit of
c 
whoredoms hath caused them to
err, and they have gone a whoring
from under their God.
13 They sacrifice upon the tops of
the mountains, and burn incense
upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow
thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and
your spouses shall commit a adultery.
14 I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom,
nor your spouses when they commit
adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice
with harlots: therefore the people
that doth not understand shall fall.
15 ¶ Though thou, Israel, play the
a 
harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and
come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go
ye up to b Beth-aven, nor swear, The
Lord liveth.

O house of the king; for judgment is
toward you, because ye have been a
snare on Mizpah, and a net spread
upon Tabor.
2 And the revolters are profound
to make slaughter, though I have
been a rebuker of them all.
3 I know Ephraim, and Israel is not
hid from me: for now, O Ephraim,
thou committest a whoredom, and
Israel is defiled.
4 a They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the
spirit of whoredoms is in the midst
of them, and they have not known
the Lord.
5 And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel
and Ephraim fall in their iniquity;
Judah also shall fall with them.
6 They shall go with their flocks
and with their herds to seek the
Lord; but they shall not find him;
he hath a withdrawn himself from

10 The princes of Judah were like
them that remove the a bound: therefore I will pour out my wrath upon
them like water.
11 Ephraim is oppressed and broken
in judgment, because he willingly
walked a after the commandment.
12 Therefore will I be unto Ephraim
as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.
13 When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his a wound,
then went b Ephraim to the Assyrian,
and sent to king c Jareb: yet could
he not d heal you, nor cure you of
your wound.
14 For I will be unto Ephraim as
a lion, and as a young lion to the
house of Judah: I, even I, will tear
and go away; I will take away, and
none shall rescue him.
15 ¶ I will go and return to my
place, till they a acknowledge their
offence, and b seek my face: in their
c 
affliction they will seek me early.
Chapter 6
Hosea calls Israel to return and serve
the Lord—The mercy and knowledge
of God are more important than ritualistic sacrifices.
Come, and let us return unto the
Lord: for he hath torn, and he will
a 
heal us; he hath smitten, and he
will bind us up.
2 After two days will he a revive
us: in the third day he will raise us
up, and we shall live in his b sight.

4 They are all adulterers, as an oven
heated by the baker, who ceaseth
from raising after he hath kneaded
the dough, until it be leavened.
5 In the day of our king the princes
have made him sick with bottles

with scorners.
6 For they have made ready their
heart like an oven, whiles they lie

night; in the morning it burneth as

7 They are all hot as an oven, and

9 a Strangers have devoured his

4 They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a a covenant:
thus judgment springeth up as

out the corn; but I passed over upon
her fair neck: I will make Ephraim

shall break his clods.

12 Sow to yourselves in a righteousness, b reap in mercy; c break up your
fallow ground: for it is time to seek
the Lord, till he come and rain
righteousness upon you.
13 Ye have plowed a wickedness, ye
have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten
the fruit of lies: because thou didst
trust in thy way, in the multitude
of thy mighty men.
14 Therefore shall a tumult arise
among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as a Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day
of battle: the mother was b dashed
in pieces upon her children.

because of your great wickedness:
in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.

Israel, as a child, was called out of Egypt
in similitude of our Lord, as a child,
coming out of Egypt—But Ephraim
turns away from the Lord.
When Israel was a child, then I
a 
loved him, and called my b son out
of c Egypt.
2 As they called them, so they
went from them: they a sacrificed
unto b Baalim, and burned incense
to graven images.
3 I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they
knew not that I a healed them.
4 I drew them with cords of a man,
with bands of a love: and I was to them
as they that take off the yoke on their
jaws, and I laid meat unto them.

There is no Savior beside the Lord—He

2 And now they sin more and more,

5 I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant
from the plain of Aven, and him
that holdeth the sceptre from the
house of Eden: and the people of
Syria shall go into captivity unto
Kir, saith the Lord.
6 ¶ Thus saith the Lord; For three
transgressions of Gaza, and for four,
I will not turn away the punishment
thereof; because they carried away
captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom:
7 But I will send a fire on the wall

from a Ashdod, and him that holdeth

9 ¶ Thus saith the Lord; For three

him up, and he that burneth him,
to bring out the bones out of the

Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue:

Amos relates how he was called of God
to be a prophet—He prophesies the captivity of Israel.
Thus hath the Lord God shewed
unto me; and, behold, he formed
grasshoppers in the beginning of
the shooting up of the latter growth;
and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king’s mowings.

they had made an end of eating
the grass of the land, then I said, O

shall not be, saith the Lord.
4 ¶ Thus hath the Lord God shewed
unto me: and, behold, the Lord God
called to contend by fire, and it
devoured the great deep, and did
eat up a part.
5 Then said I, O Lord God, cease, I
beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob
arise? for he is small.
6 a The Lord repented for this: This
also shall not be, saith the Lord God.
7 ¶ Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall
made by a plumbline, with a plumb­
line in his hand.
8 And the Lord said unto me,
Amos, what seest thou? And I said,
A plumbline. Then said the Lord,
Behold, I will set a plumbline in
the midst of my people Israel: I will
not again a pass by them any more:
9 And the high places of Isaac shall
be desolate, and the sanctuaries of
Israel shall be laid waste; and I will
rise against the a house of Jeroboam
with the sword.
10 ¶ Then Amaziah the priest of
Beth-el sent to a Jeroboam king of
Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired
against thee in the midst of the
house of Israel: the land is not able
to bear all his words.
11 For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam
shall die by the sword, and Israel
shall surely be led away captive out
of their own land.
12 Also Amaziah said unto Amos,
O thou a seer, go, flee thee away into
the land of Judah, and there eat
bread, and prophesy there:
13 But prophesy not again any
more at Beth-el: for it is the king’s

said to Amaziah, I was no a prophet,

of sycomore fruit:
15 And the Lord took me as I followed the flock, and the a Lord said
unto me, b Go, c prophesy unto my
people Israel.
16 ¶ Now therefore hear thou the
word of the Lord: Thou sayest,
Prophesy not against Israel, and
drop not thy word against the house
of Isaac.
17 Therefore thus saith the Lord;
Thy wife shall be an harlot in the
city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy
land shall be divided by line; and
thou shalt die in a polluted land:
and a Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.

Amos prophesies the downfall of Israel—There will be a famine of hearing
the word of the Lord.
Thus hath the Lord God shewed
unto me: and behold a basket of
summer fruit.
2 And he said, Amos, what seest
thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the Lord unto
me, The a end is come upon my people of Israel; I will not again b pass
by them any more.
3 And the songs of the temple shall
be howlings in that day, saith the
Lord God: there shall be many dead
bodies in every place; they shall
cast them forth with silence.

1148

3 But Jonah rose up to a flee unto
Tarshish from the b presence of the
Lord, and went down to Joppa; and
he found a ship going to Tarshish:
so he paid the fare thereof, and
went down into it, to go with them
unto Tarshish from the presence of
the Lord.
4 ¶ But the Lord sent out a great
wind into the sea, and there was a
mighty a tempest in the sea, so that
the ship was like to be broken.
5 Then the mariners were afraid,
and cried every man unto his god,
and cast forth the wares that were
in the ship into the sea, to lighten it
of them. But Jonah was gone down
into the sides of the ship; and he
lay, and was fast asleep.
6 So the shipmaster came to him,
and said unto him, What meanest
thou, O sleeper? arise, a call upon
thy God, if so be that God will think
upon us, that we perish not.
7 And they said every one to his
fellow, Come, and let us cast lots,
that we may know for whose cause
this evil is upon us. So they cast lots,
and the lot fell upon Jonah.
8 Then said they unto him, Tell
us, we pray thee, for whose cause
this evil is upon us; What is thine
occupation? and whence comest
thou? what is thy country ? and of
what people art thou?
9 And he said unto them, I am an
Hebrew; and I fear the a Lord, the
God of heaven, which hath made
the sea and the dry land.
10 Then were the men exceedingly
afraid, and said unto him, Why hast
thou done this? For the men knew
that he fled from the presence of
the Lord, because he had told them.
11 ¶ Then said they unto him,
What shall we do unto thee, that the
sea may be calm unto us? for the sea
wrought, and was tempestuous.
12 And he said unto them, Take

me up, and cast me forth into the
sea; so shall the sea be calm unto
you: for I know that for my sake this
great tempest is upon you.
13 Nevertheless the men rowed
hard to bring it to the land; but
they could not: for the sea wrought,
and was tempestuous against them.
14 Wherefore they cried unto the
Lord, and said, We beseech thee, O
Lord, we beseech thee, let us not
perish for this man’s life, and lay not
upon us innocent blood: for thou, O
Lord, hast done as it pleased thee.
15 So they took up Jonah, and cast
him forth into the sea: and the sea
ceased from her raging.
16 Then the men feared the Lord
exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice
unto the Lord, and made vows.
17 ¶ Now the Lord had prepared
a great fish to swallow up Jonah.
And Jonah was in the belly of the
fish a three days and three nights.
Chapter 2
Jonah prays to the Lord, and the fish
vomits him out on dry ground.
Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord
his God out of the fish’s belly,
2 And said, I cried by reason of
mine a affliction unto the Lord, and
he heard me; out of the belly of b hell
cried I, and thou heardest my voice.
3 For thou hadst cast me into the
deep, in the midst of the seas; and
the floods compassed me about: all
thy billows and thy waves passed
over me.
4 Then I said, I am cast out of thy
sight; yet I will look again toward
thy holy a temple.
5 The waters compassed me about,
a 
even to the soul: the depth closed
me round about, the weeds were
wrapped about my head.

mountains; the earth with her bars

Chapter 3
Jonah prophesies the downfall of Nineveh—The people repent, and the city
is saved.
And the word of the Lord came
unto Jonah the second time, saying,
2 Arise, go unto Nineveh, that
great city, and a preach unto it the
preaching that I bid thee.
3 So Jonah arose, and went unto
Nineveh, according to the word
of the Lord. Now Nineveh was an
a 
exceeding great city of three days’
b 
journey.
4 And Jonah began to enter into
the city a day’s journey, and he
cried, and said, Yet forty days, and
Nineveh shall be overthrown.
5 ¶ a So the people of b Nineveh
believed God, and proclaimed a

the greatest of them even to the

of Nineveh, and he arose from his
throne, and he laid his robe from
him, and covered him with a sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
7 And he caused it to be proclaimed
and published through Nineveh by
the decree of the king and his nobles,
saying, Let neither man nor beast,
herd nor flock, taste any thing: let
them not feed, nor drink water:
8 But let man and beast be covered
with sackcloth, and cry mightily
unto God: yea, let them a turn every one from his evil way, and from
the violence that is in their hands.
9 Who can tell if a God will turn
and repent, and turn away from
his fierce anger, that we perish not?

that they b turned from their c evil

Chapter 4
Jonah is displeased with the Lord for

rebukes him.
But it displeased Jonah exceedingly,
and he was very angry.
2 And he prayed unto the Lord,
and said, I pray thee, O Lord, was
not this my saying, when I was yet in

4 ¶ Then said the Lord, Doest thou
well to be angry ?
5 So Jonah went out of the city, and
sat on the east side of the city,
and there made him a a booth, and
sat under it in the shadow, till he
might see what would become of
the city.
6 And the Lord God prepared a
a 
gourd, and made it to come up over
Jonah, that it might be a shadow
over his head, to deliver him from
his grief. So Jonah was exceeding
glad of the gourd.
7 But God prepared a worm when
the morning rose the next day, and
it smote the gourd that it withered.
8 And it came to pass, when the
sun did arise, that God prepared a
vehement a east wind; and the sun

beat upon the head of Jonah, that
he fainted, and wished in himself
to die, and said, It is better for me to

9 And God said to Jonah, Doest
thou well to be a angry for the gourd?
And he said, I do well to be angry,
even unto death.
10 Then said the Lord, Thou hast
had pity on the gourd, for the which
thou hast not laboured, neither
madest it grow; which came up in
a night, and perished in a night:

But in the last days it shall come

woman in a travail: for now shalt
thou go forth out of the city, and thou
shalt dwell in the field, and thou
shalt go even to b Babylon; there shalt
thou be delivered; there the Lord
shall redeem thee from the hand of
thine c enemies.
11 ¶ Now also many nations are
a 
gathered against thee, that say,
Let her be defiled, and let our eye
look upon Zion.
12 But they know not the thoughts
of the Lord, neither understand
they his counsel: for he shall gather
them as the sheaves into the floor.
13 Arise and thresh, O daughter
of Zion: for I will make thine horn
iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass:
and thou shalt a beat in pieces many
people: and I will b consecrate their
gain unto the Lord, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole
earth.

Jacob will triumph gloriously over the

though thou be little among the

shall he come forth unto me that is
to be c ruler in Israel; whose goings
forth have been from of old, from
d 
everlasting.
3 Therefore will he give them up,
until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth: then
the a remnant of his brethren shall
return unto the children of Israel.
4 ¶ And he shall stand and a feed
in the b strength of the Lord, in the
majesty of the name of the Lord
his God; and they shall abide: for
now shall he be great unto the ends
of the earth.
5 And this man shall be the a peace,
when the Assyrian shall come into
our land: and when he shall tread
in our palaces, then shall we raise
against him seven shepherds, and
eight principal men.
6 And they shall waste the land
of Assyria with the sword, and the
land of a Nimrod in the entrances
thereof: thus shall he deliver us
from the Assyrian, when he cometh
into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.
7 And the remnant of Jacob shall
be in the midst of many people as a
dew from the Lord, as the showers
upon the grass, that tarrieth not for
man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.
8 ¶ And the a remnant of Jacob shall
be among the Gentiles in the midst
of many people as a b lion among
the beasts of the forest, as a young
c 
lion among the flocks of d sheep:
who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces,
and none can deliver.

7 Therefore I will look unto the

8 ¶ Rejoice not against me, O mine

dwell solitarily in the wood, in the

15 According to the days of thy

16 ¶ The nations shall see and be

shall lay their hand upon their mouth,
their ears shall be deaf.
17 They shall lick the dust like a
serpent, they shall move out of their

reserveth wrath for his enemies.
3 The Lord is a slow to anger, and
great in power, and will not at all
acquit the b wicked: the Lord hath
his way in the whirlwind and in
the storm, and the clouds are the
dust of his feet.
4 He rebuketh the sea, and mak­

7 The Lord is a  good, a strong

knoweth them that b trust in him.
8 But with an overrunning flood
he will make an utter end of the

9 What do ye imagine against the

drunken as drunkards, they shall

11 There is one come out of thee,
that imagineth evil against the

14 And the Lord hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no

the house of thy gods will I cut off
the graven image and the molten
image: I will make thy grave; for
thou art vile.

the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers
have emptied them out, and marred
their vine branches.
3 The shield of his mighty men is
made red, the valiant men are in

upon them that deal treacherously,
and holdest thy tongue when the
wicked devoureth the man that is
more righteous than he?
14 And makest men as the fishes
of the sea, as the creeping things,
that have no ruler over them?
15 They take up all of them with
the a  angle, they catch them in
their net, and gather them in their
b 
drag: therefore they rejoice and are
glad.
16 Therefore they sacrifice unto
their net, and burn incense unto
their drag; because by them their
portion is fat, and their meat plenteous.
17 Shall they therefore empty their
net, and not spare continually to
slay the nations?

saying, This people say, The time is

3 Then came the word of the Lord

4 Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell

house lie waste?
5 Now therefore thus saith the
Lord of hosts; a Consider your ways.
6 Ye have a sown much, and bring

enough; ye drink, but ye are not
filled with drink; ye clothe you,
but there is none warm; and he that

Haggai 2:1–20
Chapter 2

Haggai speaks about the Messiah—The
Desire of All Nations will come—The
Lord will give peace in His temple.
In the seventh a month, in the one
and twentieth day of the month,
came the word of the Lord by the
prophet Haggai, saying,
2 Speak now to Zerubbabel the
son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah,
and to Joshua the son of Josedech,
the high priest, and to the residue
of the people, saying,
3 Who is left among you that saw
this a house in her first glory ? and
how do ye see it now? is it not in
your eyes in comparison of it as
nothing?
4 Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the Lord; and be strong,
O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high
priest; and be a strong, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord, and
work: for I am with you, saith the
Lord of hosts:
5 According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out
of Egypt, so my a spirit remaineth
among you: fear ye not.
6 For thus saith the Lord of hosts;
Yet once, it is a little while, and I
will a shake the heavens, and the
earth, and the sea, and the dry land;
7 And I will shake all nations, and
the desire of all nations shall a come:
and I will fill this house with b glory,
saith the Lord of hosts.
8 The a silver is mine, and the gold
is mine, saith the Lord of hosts.
9 The glory of this latter house
shall be greater than of the former,
saith the Lord of hosts: and in this
place will I give a peace, saith the
Lord of hosts.
10 ¶ In the four and twentieth day
of the ninth a month, in the second
year of Darius, came the word of

the Lord by Haggai the prophet,
saying,
11 Thus saith the Lord of hosts;
Ask now the priests concerning the
law, saying,
12 If one bear holy flesh in the
skirt of his garment, and with his
skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or
wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it
be holy ? And the priests answered
and said, No.
13 Then said Haggai, If one that is
unclean by a dead body touch any
of these, shall it be unclean? And
the priests answered and said, It
shall be unclean.
14 Then answered Haggai, and
said, So is this people, and so is this
nation before me, saith the Lord;
and so is every work of their hands;
and that which they offer there is
unclean.
15 And now, I pray you, consider
from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone
in the temple of the Lord:
16 Since those days were, when one
came to an heap of twenty measures,
there were but ten: when one came
to the a pressfat for to draw out fifty
vessels out of the press, there were
but twenty.
17 I a smote you with b blasting and
with mildew and with hail in all
the labours of your hands; yet ye
c 
turned not to me, saith the Lord.
18 a Consider now from this day
and upward, from the four and
twentieth day of the ninth month,
even from the day that the foundation of the Lord’s temple was laid,
consider it.
19 Is the seed yet in the barn? yea,
as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and
the pomegranate, and the olive tree,
hath not brought forth: from this
day will I bless you.

Lord came unto Haggai in the four
and twentieth day of the month,
saying,
21 Speak to Zerubbabel, governor
of Judah, saying, I will shake the
heavens and the a earth;
22 And I will a overthrow the throne
of kingdoms, and I will destroy
the strength of the kingdoms of
the heathen; and I will overthrow

in them; and the b horses and their
riders shall come down, every one
by the sword of his c brother.
23 In that day, saith the Lord of

saith the Lord, and will make thee
as a a signet: for I have b chosen thee,
saith the Lord of hosts.

Zechariah
Chapter 1
Zechariah calls upon Judah to repent—
He is shown in vision that the cities of
Judah and the temple will be rebuilt.
n the eighth month, in the second
year of Darius, came the word of
the Lord unto a Zechariah, the
son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo
the prophet, saying,
2 The Lord hath been sore displeased with your fathers.
3 Therefore say thou unto them,
Thus saith the Lord of hosts; a Turn
ye unto me, saith the Lord of hosts,
and I will turn unto you, saith the
Lord of hosts.
4 Be ye not as your a fathers, unto
whom the former prophets have
cried, saying, Thus saith the Lord
of hosts; Turn ye now from your
evil ways, and from your evil doings:
but they did b not hear, nor c hearken
unto me, saith the Lord.
5 Your fathers, where are they  ? and
the prophets, do they live for ever?

and said, Like as the Lord of hosts

thought to do unto us, according
to our ways, and according to our
doings, so hath he dealt with us.
7 ¶ Upon the four and twentieth
day of the eleventh month, which
is the month Sebat, in the second
year of Darius, came the word of
the Lord unto Zechariah, the son
of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the
prophet, saying,
8 I saw by night, and behold a man
riding upon a red horse, and he stood
among the myrtle trees that were in
the a bottom; and behind him were
there red horses, speckled, and white.
9 Then said I, O my lord, what are
these? And the a angel that talked
with me said unto me, I will shew
thee what these be.
10 And the man that stood among
the myrtle trees answered and said,
These are they whom the Lord hath
sent to walk to and fro through the
earth.

the Lord that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked
to and fro through the earth, and,
behold, all the earth sitteth still,
and is at rest.
12 ¶ Then the angel of the Lord
answered and said, O Lord of hosts,
how long wilt thou not have mercy
on Jerusalem and on the cities of
Judah, against which thou hast
had indignation these threescore
and ten years?
13 And the Lord answered the angel that talked with me with good
words and comfortable words.
14 So the angel that communed
with me said unto me, Cry thou,
saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts;
I am a jealous for Jerusalem and for
Zion with a great jealousy.
15 And I am very sore displeased
with the heathen that are at ease:
for I was but a little displeased, and
they helped forward the affliction.
16 Therefore thus saith the Lord;
I am returned to Jerusalem with
mercies: my a house shall be built
in it, saith the Lord of hosts, and a
b 
line shall be stretched forth upon
Jerusalem.
17 Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the
Lord of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad;
and the Lord shall yet a comfort
Zion, and shall yet b choose Jerusalem.
18 ¶ Then lifted I up mine eyes,
and saw, and behold four horns.
19 And I said unto the angel that
talked with me, What be these? And
he answered me, These are the horns
which have scattered Judah, Israel,
and Jerusalem.
20 And the Lord shewed me four
a 
carpenters.
21 Then said I, What come these
to do? And he spake, saying, These
are the horns which have scattered

Chapter 2
In the last days, Judah will gather to
Jerusalem—The people will come from
the land of the north—The Lord will
dwell among them.
I lifted up mine eyes again, and
looked, and behold a man with a
measuring a line in his hand.
2 Then said I, Whither goest thou?
And he said unto me, To measure
Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth
thereof, and what is the length
thereof.
3 And, behold, the angel that
talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,
4 And said unto him, Run, speak
to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be a inhabited as towns
without walls for the multitude of
men and cattle therein:
5 For I, saith the Lord, will be unto
her a wall of a fire round about, and
will be the b glory in the midst of her.

Chapter 3
Zechariah speaks about the Messiah—
The Branch will come—At the Second
Coming, iniquity will be removed in
one day.
And he shewed me Joshua the high
priest standing before the a angel of
the Lord, and b Satan standing at
his right hand to c resist him.
2 And the Lord said unto Satan,
The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan;
even the Lord that hath chosen
Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this
a a brand plucked out of the fire?
3 Now Joshua was clothed with
a 
filthy garments, and stood before
the angel.
4 And he answered and spake
unto those that stood before him,
saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he
said, Behold, I have caused thine
iniquity to pass from thee, and I
will clothe thee with change of
raiment.

5 And I said, Let them set a a fair

a fair mitre upon his head, and
clothed him with garments. And
the angel of the Lord stood by.
6 And the angel of the Lord protested unto Joshua, saying,
7 Thus saith the Lord of hosts; If
thou wilt a walk in my ways, and
if thou wilt keep my b charge, then
thou shalt also judge my house, and
shalt also keep my courts, and I
will give thee places to walk among

priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit
before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring
forth my servant the a Branch.
9 For behold the stone that I have
laid before Joshua; upon one stone
shall be seven eyes: behold, I will
engrave the graving thereof, saith
the Lord of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in

pipes to the seven lamps, which are
upon the top thereof:
3 And two olive trees by it, one
upon the right side of the bowl, and
the other upon the left side thereof.
4 So I answered and spake to the
angel that talked with me, saying,
What are these, my lord?
5 Then the angel that talked with
me answered and said unto me,
Knowest thou not what these be?
And I said, No, my lord.
6 Then he answered and spake
unto me, saying, This is the word of
the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying,
Not by might, nor by power, but by
my a spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.
7 Who art thou, O great mountain?
before Zerubbabel thou shalt become
a plain: and he shall bring forth the
headstone thereof with shoutings,
crying, Grace, grace unto it.
8 Moreover the word of the Lord
came unto me, saying,
9 The hands of Zerubbabel have
laid the foundation of this house;
his hands shall also finish it; and
thou shalt know that the Lord of
hosts hath sent me unto you.
10 For who hath despised the day
of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in
the hand of Zerubbabel with those
seven; they are the eyes of the Lord,
which run to and fro through the
whole earth.
11 ¶ Then answered I, and said
unto him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the
candlestick and upon the left side
thereof?
12 And I answered again, and said
unto him, What be these two olive
branches which through the two
golden pipes empty the golden oil
out of themselves?
13 And he answered me and said,
Knowest thou not what these be?
And I said, No, my lord.
14 Then said he, These are the two

anointed ones, that stand by the
Lord of the whole earth.

An angel reveals truths to Zechariah
by the use of symbolic representations.
Then I turned, and lifted up mine
eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.
2 And he said unto me, What seest
thou? And I answered, I see a flying
roll; the length thereof is twenty
cubits, and the breadth thereof
ten cubits.
3 Then said he unto me, This is
the curse that goeth forth over the
face of the whole earth: for every
one that a stealeth shall be b cut off
as on this side according to it; and
every one that sweareth shall be cut
off as on that side according to it.
4 I will bring it forth, saith the
Lord of hosts, and it shall enter into
the house of the thief, and into the
house of him that sweareth falsely
by my name: and it shall remain in
the midst of his house, and shall
consume it with the timber thereof
and the stones thereof.
5 ¶ Then the angel that talked
with me went forth, and said unto
me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see
what is this that goeth forth.
6 And I said, What is it? And he
said, This is an ephah that goeth
forth. He said moreover, This is their
resemblance through all the earth.
7 And, behold, there was lifted up
a talent of lead: and this is a woman
that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.
8 And he said, This is wickedness.
And he cast it into the midst of the
ephah; and he cast the weight of
lead upon the mouth thereof.
9 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and
looked, and, behold, there came
out two women, and the wind was
in their wings; for they had wings
like the wings of a stork: and they
lifted up the ephah between the
earth and the heaven.
10 Then said I to the angel that
talked with me, Whither do these
bear the ephah?

Chapter 6
Zechariah crowns Joshua, the high
priest, in similitude of Christ, the
Branch, who will come—Christ will be
a priest upon His throne forever.
And I turned, and lifted up mine
eyes, and looked, and, behold, there
came four chariots out from between
two mountains; and the mountains
were mountains of brass.
2 In the first chariot were red
horses; and in the second chariot
black horses;
3 And in the third chariot white
horses; and in the fourth chariot
grisled and bay horses.
4 Then I answered and said unto
the angel that talked with me, What
are these, my lord?
5 And the angel answered and said
unto me, These are the four a spirits of the heavens, which go forth
from standing before the Lord of
all the earth.
6 The black horses which are
therein go forth into the north
country; and the white go forth
after them; and the grisled go
forth toward the south country.
7 And the bay went forth, and
sought to go that they might walk
to and fro through the earth: and he
said, Get you hence, walk to and fro
through the earth. So they walked
to and fro through the earth.
8 Then cried he upon me, and
spake unto me, saying, Behold, these
that go toward the north country
have quieted my spirit in the north
country.
9 ¶ And the word of the Lord
came unto me, saying,

make crowns, and set them upon the
head of Joshua the son of Josedech,
the high priest;
12 And speak unto him, saying,
Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts,
saying, Behold the man a whose
name is The b Branch; and he shall
grow up out of his place, and he
shall build the temple of the Lord:
13 Even he shall build the temple
of the Lord; and he shall bear the
glory, and shall sit and rule upon
his throne; and he shall be a priest
upon his throne: and the counsel of
peace shall be between them both.
14 And the crowns shall be to

of the Lord.

The Lord reproves hypocrisy in fasts—
He calls upon the people to show mercy

And it came to pass in the fourth
year of king Darius, that the word

of hosts, and to the prophets, saying,
Should I weep in the fifth month,
separating myself, as I have done
these so many years?
4 ¶ Then came the word of the
Lord of hosts unto me, saying,
5 Speak unto all the people of the
land, and to the priests, saying,
When ye fasted and mourned in
the fifth and seventh month, even
those seventy years, did ye at all
a 
fast unto me, even to me?
6 And when ye did eat, and when
ye did drink, did not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?
7 Should ye not hear the words
which the Lord hath cried by the
a 
former prophets, when Jerusalem
was inhabited and in prosperity,
and the cities thereof round about
her, when men inhabited the south
and the plain?
8 ¶ And the word of the Lord came
unto Zechariah, saying,
9 Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts,
saying, Execute true a judgment,
and shew b mercy and c compassions
every man to his brother:
10 And a oppress not the widow, nor
the fatherless, the stranger, nor the
b 
poor; and let none of you imagine
evil against his brother in your heart.
11 But they refused to hearken,
and pulled away the shoulder, and
stopped their ears, that they should
not hear.
12 Yea, they made their hearts as
an adamant a stone, lest they should
hear the law, and the words which
the Lord of hosts hath sent in his
spirit by the former b  prophets:
therefore came a great wrath from
the Lord of hosts.
13 Therefore it is come to pass,
that as he cried, and they would not
hear; so a they b cried, and I would
not hear, saith the Lord of hosts:

Lord will bless His people beyond anything in the past.
Again the word of the Lord of hosts
came to me, saying,
2 Thus saith the Lord of hosts;
I was jealous for Zion with great
jealousy, and I was a jealous for her
with great fury.
3 Thus saith the Lord; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in
the midst of Jerusalem: and a Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth;
and the b mountain of the Lord of
hosts the holy mountain.
4 Thus saith the Lord of hosts;
There shall yet a old men and old
women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff
in his hand for very age.
5 And the streets of the city shall
be full of boys and girls playing in
the streets thereof.
6 Thus saith the Lord of hosts; If
it be marvellous in the eyes of the
remnant of this people in these
days, should it also be marvellous in
mine eyes? saith the Lord of hosts.
7 Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Behold, I will a save my people from
the east country, and from the west
country;
8 And I will bring them, and they
shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my a people,
and I will be their God, in truth and
in righteousness.

9 ¶ Thus saith the Lord of hosts;
Let your hands be strong, ye that
hear in these days these words by the
mouth of the a prophets, which were
in the day that the foundation of
the house of the Lord of hosts was
laid, that the temple might be built.
10 For before these days there was
no hire for man, nor any hire for
beast; neither was there any peace to
him that went out or came in because
of the affliction: for I set all men
every one against his neighbour.
11 But now I will not be unto the
residue of this people as in the former days, saith the Lord of hosts.
12 For the seed shall be prosperous;
the vine shall give her fruit, and the
ground shall give her increase, and
the heavens shall give their dew;
and I will cause the remnant of this
people to possess all these things.
13 And it shall come to pass, that
as ye were a a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house
of Israel; so will I b save you, and ye
shall be a c blessing: fear not, but let
your hands be strong.
14 For thus saith the Lord of hosts;
As I thought to punish you, when
your fathers provoked me to wrath,
saith the Lord of hosts, and I a repented not:
15 So again have I thought in these
days to do well unto Jerusalem and
to the house of Judah: fear ye not.
16 ¶ These are the things that ye
shall do; Speak ye every man the
a 
truth to his neighbour; execute
the b judgment of truth and c peace
in your gates:
17 And let none of you imagine
evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no a false oath: for
all these are things that I hate, saith
the Lord.
18 ¶ And the word of the Lord of
hosts came unto me, saying,

fast of the fifth, and the fast of the
seventh, and the fast of the tenth,
shall be to the house of Judah joy
and gladness, and cheerful feasts;
therefore love the truth and peace.
20 Thus saith the Lord of hosts;
It shall yet come to pass, that there
shall come people, and the inhabi­
tants of many cities:
21 And the inhabitants of one city
shall go to another, saying, Let us go
speedily to pray before the Lord,
and to seek the Lord of hosts: I
will go also.
22 Yea, many a people and strong
nations shall come to seek the Lord
of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray
before the Lord.
23 Thus saith the Lord of hosts;
In those days it shall come to pass,
that ten men shall take hold out of
all languages of the nations, even
shall take hold of the skirt of him
that is a Jew, saying, We will go
with you: for we have heard that
God is with a you.
Chapter 9
Zechariah speaks as the Messiah—The
Messiah will come, having salvation,
lowly and riding upon an ass—He will
free the prisoners from the pit—Judah
and Ephraim are instruments of the
Lord.
The burden of the word of the
Lord in the land of Hadrach, and
Damascus shall be the rest thereof:
when the eyes of man, as of all the
tribes of Israel, shall be toward the
Lord.
2 And Hamath also shall border
thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though
it be very wise.
3 And a Tyrus did build herself a
strong hold, and heaped up silver
as the dust, and fine gold as the
mire of the streets.

5 a Ashkelon shall see it, and fear;
Gaza also shall see it, and be very
sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the
king shall perish from Gaza, and
Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.
6 And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of
the Philistines.
7 And I will take away his blood
out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but
he that remaineth, even he, shall
be for our God, and he shall be as
a governor in Judah, and Ekron as
a a Jebusite.
8 And I will encamp about mine
house because of the army, because
of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no
oppressor shall pass through them
any more: for now have I seen with
mine eyes.

Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy b King cometh unto
thee: he is c just, and having salvation;
lowly, and d riding upon an e ass, and
upon a f colt the foal of an ass.
10 And I will cut off the chariot
from Ephraim, and the a horse from
Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall
be cut off: and he shall speak peace
unto the b heathen: and his c dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and
from the river even to the ends of

comfort in vain: therefore they went
their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no c shepherd.
3 Mine anger was kindled against
the shepherds, and I punished the
goats: for the Lord of hosts hath
visited his flock the house of Judah,
and hath made them as his goodly
horse in the battle.
4 Out of him came forth a the corner, out of him the b nail, out of him
the battle bow, out of him every
oppressor together.
5 ¶ And they shall be as mighty
men, which tread down their enemies
in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the
Lord is with them, and the riders
on horses shall be confounded.
6 And I will strengthen the house
of Judah, and I will save the house
of Joseph, and I will bring them
again to place them; for I have
mercy upon them: and they shall
be as though I had not cast them
off: for I am the Lord their God,
and will a hear them.
7 And they of a Ephraim shall be
like a mighty man, and their heart
shall rejoice as through wine: yea,
their children shall see it, and be
glad; their heart shall rejoice in
the Lord.
8 I will hiss for them, and a gather
them; for I have redeemed them:
and they shall increase as they have
increased.
9 And I will a sow them among the
people: and they shall b remember
me in far countries; and they shall
live with their children, and turn
again.

Chapter 11
Zechariah speaks about the Messiah—
The Messiah will be betrayed for thirty
pieces of silver—They will be cast to the
potter in the house of the Lord.
Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the
fire may devour thy cedars.
2 Howl, a fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled:
howl, O ye b oaks of Bashan; for the
forest of the vintage is come down.
3 ¶ There is a voice of the howling
of the shepherds; for their glory is
spoiled: a voice of the roaring of
young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.
4 Thus saith the Lord my God;
Feed the flock of the slaughter;
5 Whose possessors slay them, and
hold themselves not a guilty: and
they that sell them say, Blessed be
the Lord; for I am b rich: and their
own shepherds pity them not.
6 For I will no more pity the
inhabitants of the land, saith the
Lord: but, lo, I will deliver the men
every one into his neighbour’s hand,
and into the hand of his king: and
they shall smite the land, and out
of their hand I will not deliver them.

slaughter, even you, O poor of the
flock. And I took unto me two
staves; the one I called Beauty, and
the other I called a Bands; and I fed
the flock.
8 Three shepherds also I cut off
in one month; and my soul lothed
them, and their soul also abhorred
me.
9 Then said I, I will not feed you:
that that dieth, let it die; and that
that is to be cut off, let it be cut off;
and let the rest eat every one the
flesh of another.
10 ¶ And I took my staff, even
Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I
might break my covenant which
I had made with all the people.
11 And it was broken in that day:
and so the poor of the flock a that
waited upon me knew that it was
the word of the Lord.
12 And I said unto them, If ye
think good, give me my price; and
if not, forbear. So they weighed for
my price a thirty pieces of b silver.
13 And the Lord said unto me,
Cast it unto the a potter: a goodly
price that I was b prised at of them.
And I took the thirty pieces of silver,
and cast them to the potter in the
house of the Lord.
14 Then I cut asunder mine other
staff, even a Bands, that I might break
the brotherhood between Judah
and Israel.
15 ¶ And the Lord said unto me,
Take unto thee yet the instruments
of a foolish shepherd.
16 For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not
visit those that be cut off, neither
shall seek the young one, nor heal
that that is broken, nor feed that
that standeth still: but he shall eat
the flesh of the fat, and tear their
claws in pieces.

upon his arm, and upon his right
eye: his arm shall be clean dried
up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.
Chapter 12
In the final great war, all nations
will be engaged at Jerusalem, but the
Lord will defend His people—Then the
Jews will look upon the Lord, whom
they crucified, and there will be great
mourning.
The burden of the word of the
Lord for Israel, saith the Lord,
which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of
the a earth, and formeth the b spirit
of man within him.
2 Behold, I will make Jerusalem a
a 
cup of trembling unto all the b people round about, when they shall
be in the siege both against Judah
and against Jerusalem.
3 ¶ And in that day will I make
Jerusalem a burdensome stone for
all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces,
though all the people of the earth
be a gathered together against it.
4 In that day, saith the Lord, I will
smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness:
and I will open mine eyes upon the
house of Judah, and will smite every
horse of the people with blindness.
5 And the governors of Judah shall
say in their heart, The inhabitants
of Jerusalem shall be my strength in
the Lord of hosts their God.
6 ¶ In that day will I make the
governors of Judah like an a hearth
of fire among the wood, and like a
torch of fire in a sheaf; and they

even in Jerusalem.
7 The Lord also shall save the tents
of Judah first, that the glory of the
house of a David and the glory of
the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not
magnify themselves against Judah.
8 In that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
and he that is feeble among them
at that day shall be as David; and
the house of David shall be as God,
as the angel of the Lord before
them.
9 ¶ And it shall come to pass in
that day, that I will seek to a destroy
all the nations that come against
b 
Jerusalem.
10 And I will a pour upon the house
of David, and upon the inhabitants
of Jerusalem, the spirit of b grace
and of supplications: and they shall

look upon me whom they have

pierced, and they shall e mourn for
him, as one mourneth for his f only
son, and shall be in bitterness for
him, as one that is in bitterness
for his firstborn.
11 In that day shall there be a
great a mourning in Jerusalem, as
the mourning of Hadadrimmon in
the valley of Megiddon.
12 And the land shall a mourn,
every family apart; the family of
the house of David apart, and their
wives apart; the family of the house
of Nathan apart, and their wives
apart;
13 The family of the house of Levi
apart, and their wives apart; the
family of Shimei apart, and their
wives apart;

apart.

8 And it shall come to pass, that
in all the land, saith the Lord, two

but the third shall be a left therein.
9 And I will bring the third part
through the fire, and will a refine

At His Second Coming, the Lord will
fight for Israel—His feet will stand
upon the Mount of Olives—He will be
King over all the earth—Plagues will
destroy the wicked.
Behold, the a  day of the Lord
cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.
2 For I will gather all nations
against Jerusalem to a battle; and
the city shall be taken, and the
b 
houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go
forth into captivity, and the residue
of the people shall not be cut off
from the city.
3 Then shall the Lord go forth,
and a fight against those nations, as
when he fought in the day of battle.
4 ¶ And his a feet shall b stand in
that day upon the c mount of Olives,
which is before Jerusalem on the
east, and the mount of Olives shall

the people that have fought against
Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon
their feet, and their eyes shall
consume away in their holes, and
their tongue shall consume away
in their mouth.
13 And it shall come to pass in
that day, that a great tumult from
the Lord shall be among them;
and they shall lay hold every one
on the hand of his neighbour, and
his hand shall rise up against the
hand of his a neighbour.
14 And Judah also shall fight
at Jerusalem; and the wealth of
all the a heathen round about shall
be gathered together, gold, and
silver, and apparel, in great abundance.
15 a And so shall be the plague of
the horse, of the mule, of the camel,
and of the ass, and of all the beasts
that shall be in these b tents, as this
plague.
16 ¶ And it shall come to pass,
that every one that is left of all the
nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year
to year to a worship the b King, the

Lord of hosts, and to keep the c feast
of d tabernacles.
17 And it shall be, that whoso will
not come up of all the families of
the earth unto Jerusalem to worship
the King, the Lord of hosts, even
upon them shall be no rain.
18 And if the family of Egypt go
not up, and come not, that have
no rain; there shall be the plague,
wherewith the Lord will smite the
a 
heathen that come not up to keep
the feast of tabernacles.
19 This shall be the punishment
of Egypt, and the punishment of all
nations that come not up to keep
the feast of tabernacles.
20 ¶ In that day shall there be upon
the bells of the horses, a Holiness
unto the Lord; and the pots in
the Lord’s house shall be like the
bowls before the altar.
21 Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and
in Judah shall be a holiness unto
the Lord of hosts: and all they
that sacrifice shall come and take
of them, and b seethe therein: and
in that day there shall be no more
the c Canaanite in the house of the

3 And I hated Esau, and laid his
mountains and his a heritage b waste
for the c dragons of the wilderness.
4 Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and
build the desolate places; thus saith
the Lord of hosts, They shall build,
but I will throw down; and they shall
call them, The border of wickedness,
and, The people against whom the
Lord hath indignation for ever.
5 And your eyes shall see, and ye
shall say, The Lord will be magnified from the border of Israel.
6 ¶ A son a honoureth his father, and
a servant his master: if then I be a
father, where is mine b honour? and
if I be a master, where is my fear?
saith the Lord of hosts unto you, O
priests, that despise my name. And
ye say, Wherein have we despised
thy name?
7 Ye offer polluted bread upon
mine altar; and ye say, Wherein
have we polluted thee? In that ye
say, The table of the Lord is contemptible.
8 And if ye offer the a blind for
b 
sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer c the lame and sick, is it not evil?
offer it now unto thy governor; will
he be pleased with thee, or accept
thy person? saith the Lord of hosts.
9 And now, I pray you, beseech
God that he will be gracious unto
us: this hath been by your means:
will he regard your persons? saith
the Lord of hosts.
10 Who is there even among you
that would shut the doors for nought?
neither do ye kindle fire on mine
altar for nought. I have no pleasure
in you, saith the Lord of hosts,
neither will I a accept an offering
at your hand.

12 ¶ But ye have profaned it, in
that ye say, The a table of the Lord
is polluted; and the fruit thereof,
even his meat, is contemptible.
13 Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have a snuffed at

brought that which was torn, and the

4 And ye shall know that I have
sent this commandment unto you,
that my a covenant might be with
Levi, saith the Lord of hosts.
5 My a covenant was with him of
life and peace; and I gave them
to him for the fear wherewith he
feared me, and was afraid before
my name.
6 The law of a truth was in his
mouth, and iniquity was not found
in his lips: he walked with me in
peace and equity, and did b turn
many away from c iniquity.
7 For the priest’s lips should keep
a 
knowledge, and they should seek
the b law at his mouth: for he is the
c 
messenger of the Lord of hosts.
8 But ye are a departed out of the
way; ye have caused many to b stumble at the law; ye have c corrupted
the d covenant of Levi, saith the
Lord of hosts.
9 Therefore have I also made you
a 
contemptible and base before all
the people, according as ye have
not kept my ways, but have been
partial in the law.
10 Have we not all one a father?
hath not one God b created us? why
do we deal treacherously every man
against his brother, by c profaning
the covenant of our fathers?
11 ¶ Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem;
for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the Lord which he loved,
and hath a married the daughter of
a b strange god.

13 And this have ye done again,
covering the altar of the Lord with
tears, with weeping, and with crying
out, insomuch that he regardeth not
the offering any more, or receiveth
it with good will at your hand.
14 ¶ Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the Lord hath been witness
between thee and the a wife of thy
youth, against whom thou hast dealt
treacherously: yet is she thy compan­
ion, and the wife of thy covenant.
15 And did not he make a one? Yet
had he the residue of the spirit. And
wherefore one? That he might seek
a b godly c seed. Therefore take heed
to your spirit, and let none deal
treacherously against the d wife of
his youth.
16 For the Lord, the God of Israel,
saith that he hateth a putting away:
for one covereth violence with his
garment, saith the Lord of hosts:
therefore take heed to your spirit,
that ye deal not treacherously.
17 ¶ Ye have wearied the Lord
with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein
have we wearied him? When ye say,
Every one that doeth a evil is good
in the sight of the Lord, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the

shall suddenly c come to his d temple,
even the e messenger of the covenant,
whom ye delight in: behold, he shall
